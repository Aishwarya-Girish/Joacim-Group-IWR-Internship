[Distribution Of Microplastic And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Pollution In Jiulong River Estuary],"Pollution from microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is prevalent in estuarine regions. MPs may also enrich ARGs and increase the spread of ARGs. This study investigated the distribution characteristics of MPs in surface water and sediments from different stations in Jiulong River estuary for the first time, determined eight common ARGs abundance in each sample, and analyzed the correlation between MPs content and ARGs abundance. The results showed:① MPs concentrations in the Jiulong River estuary water environment ranged from 2 to 66 n·L-1, and the sediment content range (dw) was 8 to 85 n·kg-1. The main materials of MPs detected were polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE). More than 85% of the MPs were smaller than 1 mm. ② The predominant ARGs in the estuary were tetracycline resistance genes tetC and tetG and sulfonamide resistance gene sul2; the relative abundance of ARGs in the surface water showed a significant negative correlation with salinity. ③ A positive correlation existed among MPs concentration, ARGs relative abundance, and class1 integron geneintI1, which implied that MPs may promote the spread of ARGs in seawater.","Hong Cheng, Rong Chen",10.13227/j.hjkx.202206008,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Microplastic-Induced Alterations To Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Seawater],"The increasing and combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments is a great ecological and health concern. However, MP-induced alterations to ARGs in seawater is poorly understood, impeding risk assessment of plastics. We profiled the diversity and abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in seawater after the addition of three different MPs (PE, PVC, and PVA) and 49-day aerated incubation.A total of 20, 35, 42, and 64 ARGs were detected in BLK, PE, PVC, and PVA, with 2, 4, 2, and 3 MGEs, respectively. The absolute abundance of ARGs in the seawater aerated with MPs ranged from 4.01×106 copies ·L-1 to 1.05×108 copies ·L-1. Additionally, the variety and richness of ARGs and MGEs in PVA were significantly higher than in the original seawater, or the seawater aerated with the other two MPs. This indicates that PVA, which is water soluble, could induce more diverse and abundant ARGs in seawater. Significant correlations among ARGs, MGEs, and 16S rRNA genes were observed, implying that the occurrence of MGEs in seawater may accelerate the transmission of ARGs through horizontal gene transfer, and bacterial microorganisms could directly affect the propagation and dissemination of ARGs.","Shu-Yi-Dan Zhou, Yong-Guan Zhu, Fu-Yi Huang",10.13227/j.hjkx.202101009,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Effects And Mechanisms Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wastewater],"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are typical co-existing emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment plants. MPs have been shown to alter the distribution pattern of ARGs in sludge, but their effects on free extracellular ARGs (feARGs) in wastewater remain unclear. In this study, we used fluorescence quantitative PCR to investigate the dynamics of feARGs (including tetC, tetO, sul1, and sul2) in wastewater and their transition mechanisms after 60 d of exposure to typical MPs (polystyrene, PS). The results showed that the absolute abundance of tetracycline feARGs decreased by 28.4 %-76.0 % and 35.2 %-96.2 %, respectively, under nm-level and mm-level PS exposure and changed by -55.4 %-122.4 % under μm-level PS exposure. The abundance of sul1 showed a trend of nm-level &gt; μm-level &gt; mm-level upon PS exposure, and the changes in sul1 abundance was greater with ρ(PS)=50 mg·L-1 exposure. The relative abundance of sul2 was reduced by 25.4 %-42.6 % and 46.1 %-90.3 % after μm-level and mm-level PS exposure, respectively, and increased by 1.9-3.9 times after nm-level PS exposure, and the sul2 showed a higher reduction at ρ (PS)=50 mg·L-1 exposure than that at ρ (PS)=0.5 mg·L-1. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that the relative abundance of feARGs during PS exposure was positively correlated with cell membrane permeability and typical mobile genetic elements (intI1) abundance and negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species level. Our findings elucidated the effects and corresponding mechanisms of PS on the growth and mobility of feARGs in wastewater, providing a scientific basis for the control of the combined MPs and ARGs pollution in wastewater.","Shuai Zhou, A-Chao Huang, Ze-Feng Huang, Lun-Fu Li, Feng-Juan Yang, An-Qi Chen, Fei-Chen Xiu, Yuan-Yuan Gao",10.13227/j.hjkx.202307246,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Research Progress On The Effect Of Estuary Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes],"Estuaries are transitional zones between rivers and marine environments, with intensive human activities. Pollutants pose a threat to the ecological systems of estuaries. Among these pollutants, microplastics and antibiotic resistant genes have gained significant attention due to their potential impacts on estuarine organisms and human health. Microplastics can form unique biofilms, adsorb pollutants from the surrounding environment, and provide potential hosts for antibiotic resistant genes, with positive consequence on horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. We provided an overview of the pollution status of microplastics and antibiotic resistant genes in estua-rine areas, with a particular emphasis on the influence of biofilms formed on microplastics on the enrichment, transport, and transfer of antibiotic resistant genes. We also highlighted the limitations in current research, regarding microplastic sampling, analysis methods, and inconsistent reporting units. Furthermore, we proposed prospects for the biodegradation of microplastics and potential risk assessment of microplastic biofilms.","Qing Wang, Jing-Hao Qiu, Yan Sun, Ni Ni, Shao-Jing Sun, Xu-Li Li, Sheng-Juan Yang, Yi-Ran Liu, Ying-Ying Cui",10.13287/j.1001-9332.202410.028,Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao = The Journal Of Applied Ecology
[Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Estuarine Sediments],"Microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging pollutants/contaminants, and are also the research hotspots concerning environmental health in the past few years. To explore the effects of microplastics on ARGs in estuarine sediment, three different microplastics were added to microcosm incubation experiments of sediments. Then, we investigated the persistence, abundance, diversity, and shifts of the ARGs in estuarine sediments by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results showed that the microplastics significantly changed the structure of ARGs in the sediments. PVC and PE, which are hard to degrade, had significant effects on the structures and types of ARGs. However, the PVA, which is soluble, reduced the types and persistence of ARGs significantly. The abundance of ARGs in S_PVC, S_PE, and S_PVA were 4.1×109, 8.1×109, and 2.0×109 copies·g-1, respectively. The abundance of ARGs in sediments with added PE almost increased by one order of magnitude, implying that microplastics could significantly increase the abundance of ARGs in sediments. Furthermore, OLS regression analysis showed that ARGs are significantly correlated with transposon and integron, suggesting that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) may promote the transfer and dissemination of ARGs.","Fu-Yi Huang, Kai Yang, Zi-Xing Zhang, Jian-Qiang Su, Yong-Guan Zhu, Xian Zhang",10.13227/j.hjkx.201810108,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Occurrence Characteristics Of Microplastics And Metal Elements In The Surface Water Of Huangpu River And Their Associations With Metal Resistance Genes],"Urban rivers have been regarded as the ""hotspots"" for microplastic (MPs) and metal contamination as they play important roles in pollution migration. However, as important sinks and sources of resistance genes, there has been little to no research investigating the associations between MPs, metal contaminations, and metal resistance genes (MRGs). Ten water samples were collected from the Huangpu River in situ; along with metal elements, MPs characteristics analyzed. Metal resistance genes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in waters and MPs were detected using metagenomic technology. As a result, the highest metal concentration was that of Sb in surface water (3.16±0.419) μg·L-1. The average abundance of MPs was (1.78±0.84) n·L-1, and the peak levels located in industrial and densely populated areas, which was significantly higher than those in agricultural and low population density areas. Fibrous, small-size (<0.5 mm), and transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the largest contributors of MPs. Eighteen MRGs were detected in all the samples. The relative abundance of MRGs in water was 1.68±0.21. The most dominant MRGs subtypes were merR and ruvB, which are subtypes resistant to mercury and Multi_metals. Correlation analysis showed that chromium and nickel in waters were significantly positively associated with MRG-Cr, MRG-Ni, and Multi_metals resistance genes. For MPs particles, the relative abundance of MRGs was 1.63±0.53. The most dominant MRGs subtypes were merT-P and copB, which also belong to mercury-resistant and Multi_metals. The Multi_metals resistance gene, ctpC, cueA, czrA, kmtR, etc., had significant positive associations with Ni, Cr, and Sb in waters. Compared with water samples, MPs selectively enriched merT-P, copB, ziaA, sodA, and dmeF. Additionally, the co-occurrence patterns of MRGs and MGEs were explored based on network analysis. In water samples, the transposases (tnpA_1 and tnpA_2), integrase (qacEdelta), and insertion sequence (IS91) were the major contributors of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of specific MRGs. Multiple subtypes resistant to copper and Multi_metals resistance genes on MPs were positively associated with IncFIC(FII), Rep7, rep7, and rep13, which were subtypes of plasmids. The presence of MPs exerted a significant impact on HGT of specific MRGs mediated by plasmids.","Jia-Wei Lu, Chen-Ye Xu, Chun Hu, Shu-Ren Liu, Fang Li",10.13227/j.hjkx.202206267,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue

[Effects Of Biochar Application On Physicochemical Properties And Bacterial Communities Of Microplastic-Contaminated Calcareous Soil],"Microplastics are widely distributed in the soil environment, threatening the soil ecological environment system and changing soil physicochemical properties and microbial characteristics. Biochar is often used as a soil amendment to improve soil quality due to its special pore structure and good soil nutrient retention ability. However, the understanding of the effects and mechanisms of biochar application on the physicochemical properties and bacterial communities of microplastic-contaminated soils is still very limited. Therefore, a 21-day micro-soil culture experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of biochar application on physicochemical properties and bacterial community changes in soil contaminated with different concentrations of microplastics using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. The results revealed that the application of biochar slowed down the decrease in nitrate nitrogen and Olsen-P contents in microplastic-contaminated soil and increased the total phosphorus content. Biochar addition increased the relative abundance of tolerant phylum such as Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota in microplastic-contaminated calcareous soil. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota, and Actinobacteriota were the dominant bacteria of the soil bacterial community in each treatment on day 7 and day 21. Compared with that on day 7, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes significantly decreased, and the relative abundance of Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Chloroflexi, and Myxococcota increased on day 21. Biochar application also increased the relative abundance of Lysobacter in microplastic-contaminated soils. This study demonstrated that the application of biochar increased microplastic-resistant bacteria, enhanced the stability of microplastic-contaminated soil, and slowed down the pollution of microplastics to the soil. Moreover, biochar had great potential to improve the quality of microplastic-contaminated calcareous soil.","Tai-Shan Ran, Jian Long, Hong-Kai Liao, Juan Li, Guo-Mei Yang, Yu-Xin Zhao",10.13227/j.hjkx.202209166,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Microplastics-Induced Shifts Of Diversity And Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In River Water],"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are both considered emerging contaminants of increasing concern because their combined pollution poses a serious risk to the ecological environment and human health. In this study, high-throughput quantitative PCR techniques were used to investigate the diversity and abundance of ARGs in river water, to which two different microplastics (PVC and PVA) were added for aerated incubation. The results showed that ARGs in river water were diverse, and microplastics could induce more types of ARGs. Although the number and abundance of ARGs decreased in all three treatments, which were cultivated for 14 d by aeration, compared to those in non-treated samples, the total abundance of ARGs in treatments aerated with MPs were higher than those aerated without MPs, especially in the samples treated with water-soluble microplastics (PVA). Significant correlations between the abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were observed, implying that the occurrence of MGEs may potentially affect the transmission and distribution of ARGs through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in river water.","Xin-Yuan Zhou, Yan-Zi Wang, Jian-Qiang Su, Fu-Yi Huang",10.13227/j.hjkx.202003146,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Biomechanical And Biocompatible Enhancement Of Reinforced Calcium Phosphate Cement Via Rgd Peptide Grafted Chitosan Nanofibers],"Objective: To analysis the biomechanical and biocompatible properties of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) enhanced by chitosan short nanofibers(CSNF) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Methods: Chitosan nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning, and cut into short fibers by high speed dispersion. CPC with calcium phosphorus ratio of 1.5:1 was prepared by Biocement D method. The composition and structure of CPC, CSNF, RGD modified CSNF (CSNF-RGD), CSNF enhanced CPC (CPC-CSNF), RGD modified CPC-CSNF (CPC-CSNF-RGD) were observed by infrared spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scan electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties were measured by universal mechanical testing instrument. The adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3 cells were assessed using immunofluorescence staining and MTT method. Results: The distribution of CSNF in the scaffold was homogeneous, and the porous structure between the nanofibers was observed by SEM. The infrared spectrum showed the characteristic peaks at 1633 nm and 1585 nm, indicating that RGD was successfully grafted on chitosan nanofibers. The XRD pattern showed that the bone cement had a certain curability. The stain-stress test showed that break strengths were (17.74±0.54) MPa for CPC-CSNF and (16.67±0.56) MPa for CPCP-CSNF-RGD, both were higher than that of CPC(all P<0.05). The immunofluorescence staining and MTT results indicated that MC3T3 cells grew better on CPC-CSNF-RGD after 240 min of culture(all P<0.05). Conclusion: CSNF-RGD can improve the biomechanical property and biocompatibility of CPC, indicating its potential application in bone tissue repair.","Yang Huang, Jinsong Kong, Xiaokang Gong, Xin Zheng, Haibao Wang, Jianwei Ruan",10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2017.12.04,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao.

[Enrichment Characteristics And Ecological Risk Prediction Of Pathogens On Typical Microplastic Biofilms],"As an emerging niche colonized by microorganisms, microplastics may selectively enrich pathogens, resulting in crucial ecological risks and potential threats to public health in aquatic environments. However, the enrichment characteristics and ecological risks of pathogens on different microplastic biofilms remain unclear. In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the differences in the bacterial community structure, occurrence characteristics of pathogens, and prediction of ecological risks on five typical microplastic biofilms of polyethylene （PE）, polypropylene （PP）, polystyrene （PS）, polyethylene terephthalate （PET）, and polyvinyl chloride （PVC） through a field in-situ incubation experiment. The results showed that after 28 d of in situ incubation, the macroscopic biofilms were formed on the surface of all microplastics, and the diversity and richness of the bacterial community on all microplastic biofilms were higher than in the surrounding water, indicating that the microorganisms in the surrounding water were selectively enriched on microplastics. Each type of microplastic biofilm had formed a unique bacterial community structure； in particular, PVC microplastics were more inclined to selectively enrich the members of Proteobacteria. A total of 47 human pathogens were identified using the HPB database, including six antibiotic resistance pathogens belonging to the lists of critical priority control. The number and total abundance of human pathogens detected on microplastic biofilm were higher than those in the surrounding water, and the dominant pathogens such as Bartonella, Burkholderia, and Brucella were selectively enriched on microplastic biofilms. Microbial phenotype prediction results based on BugBase showed that three functional phenotypes including biofilm formation, mobile element contained, and potentially pathogenic on microplastic biofilms had significantly increased by 2.38%-5.57%, 0.82%-7.13%, and 3.04%-8.30%, respectively, which were mainly contributed by α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria. These results not only indicate that the selective enrichment of opportunistic pathogens on microplastic biofilms may lead to the increased risk of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance co-spread but also provide reference for the accurate assessment of ecological risks caused by microplastic pollution in aquatic environments.","Fan Wang, Zhi-Xun Hu, Wan-Jun Wang, Yong-Yin Xiao, Wei-Cong Mai, Gui-Ying Li, Tai-Cheng An",10.13227/j.hjkx.202311126,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Distribution Characteristics Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Different Water Supply Pipes],"To study the distribution characteristics and horizontal transfer potential of antibiotic resistance genes in biofilms of water supply pipes made of different materials, the biofilms of 304 and 316 L stainless steel pipes and PPR and PE plastic pipes were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that a total of 146 antibiotic resistance genes belonging to 17 classes were detected in the biofilms. Multidrug resistance genes had the highest abundance and varied a lot in different biofilms, which was the main reason for the differences in antibiotic resistance genes in different biofilms. The total abundance of mobile genetic elements was high in different biofilms, but overall coexistence with antibiotic resistance genes was low, with integrase genes showing a closer relationship with antibiotic resistance genes and possibly playing an important role in the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Different antibiotic resistance genes possessed different genera of potential hosts; highly abundant hosts such as Aquabacterium and Bradyrhizobium were the basis for the presence of a high abundance of multidrug resistance genes. Microbial attachment in different pipe walls was selective, and the primary influence of antibiotic resistance in biofilms was bacterial community composition, followed by the horizontal transfer of genes mediated by mobile genetic elements, community composition, and mobile genetic elements together shaping the distribution characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes.","Chen-Xu Liu, Xiao-Hui Bai",10.13227/j.hjkx.202204208,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
[Applications Of Biofilm In Environmental Pollution Control And The Related Challenges],"Biofilm has been used in environmental pollution control in recent years due to its characteristics of adsorption and biodegradation. Beyond the success of its utilization in wastewater treatment, biofilm technique has high application value in the remediation of heavy metals and organic pollutants in soils. With the extensive attention and research of emerging pollutants such as microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the pivotal role of biofilm can not be overlooked. Here, we presented a comprehensive review of the structure, formation mecha-nism, population, and functional aspects of biofilm, as well as its applications and mechanisms in environmental pollution control in recent years. We emphatically discussed the removal mechanism and application progress of biofilm on heavy metals and organic pollutants. We further expounded some novel environmental challenges posed by biofilm under new circumstances, including the coexistence of various pollutants in plastisphere, the spread of ARGs, and the accumulation of pathogens. Finally, we put forward the gaps of current research and prospects for future research, especially the importance of exploring the interaction relationship and mechanism between biofilm and various pollutants. It is expected to provide theoretical basis for the development of new technology of biofilm remediation.","Dong-Sheng Shen, Xiao-Jing Xing, Yu-Yang Long, Cai Hui",10.13287/j.1001-9332.202405.028,Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao = The Journal Of Applied Ecology

"Intratumor Heterogeneity, Variability And Plasticity: Questioning The Current Concepts In Classification And Treatment Of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","In the classical view, the formation of a primary tumor is the consequence of a mutational event that first affects a single cell that subsequently passes through a multitude of consecutive hyperplastic and dysplastic stages. At the end of this pathogenetic sequence a cell arises that is potentially able to expanse infinitely having capacity to form a homogenous tumor mass. In contrary to this clonal expansion concept, the majority of primary human tumors display already a startling heterogeneity that can be reflected in different morphological features, physiological activities, and genetic diversity. In the past it was speculated that this cancer cell plasticity within a tumor is the result of an adaptive process that is induced by specific inhibiting therapies. In regard to the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) this dogma was once challenged in a recent study that analysed tumor areas that were taken from HCC patients without medical pretreatment. Most of the analyzed samples showed highly significant intratumor heterogeneity. This affected morphological attributes, immunohistochemical stainability of five tumor-associated markers [α-fetoprotein (AFP), EpCAM, CK7, CD44 and glutamine synthetase], and integrity of genes (β-catenin and p53) that are critically involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Altogether, this study showed that intratumor heterogeneity is a frequent finding in HCC that may contribute to treatment failure and drug resistance in HCC patients.",Ralf Weiskirchen,10.3978/j.issn.2304-3881.2016.02.04,Hepatobiliary Surgery And Nutrition

Biology Of Vibrio Cholera. Editorial Overview,"In this monographic issue, we have the pleasure to present contributions from six of the leading laboratories at the forefront of Vibrio cholerae genetics, ecology and evolution, together with a brief tribute by Diego Romero to Doctor Jaime Ferrán y Clua, a pioneering Spanish bacteriologist who developed the first vaccine against this pathogen. V. cholerae is a free-living aquatic bacterium that interacts with and infects a variety of organisms. In humans it causes cholera, the deadly diarrhoea that was responsible for millions of deaths during seven pandemics since 1817, and still thousands every year. The Boucher lab presents a study of the ecology, evolution and dispersal of pandemic V. cholerae biotypes in relation to environmental reservoirs. They show how both species-specific and lineage-specific genetic determinants play a role in the ability of V. cholerae strains to cause pandemics, having evolved gradually over centuries. One of the key aspects that makes a particularly successful pathogen is its genomic plasticity. The V. cholerae genome contains a superintegron (SI) that is involved in development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes among diverse bacterial species, permitting population expansion in challenging conditions. Escudero and Mazel review the SI as a true hotspot of V. cholerae's genomic diversity and low-cost memory of adaptive functions in its complex lifestyle and ecology. Another remarkable aspect of V. cholerae 's genetics is the presence of two chromosomes. Segregation and division in multi-chromosomal becteria is relatively complex, and V. cholerae remains the paradigm. Espinosa and colleagues review the cell cycle of V. cholerae , comparing and contrasting with that of E. coli . In addition to genome plasticity, V. cholerae uses a variety of attack/defence strategies to compete and thrive in different niches, through interaction with bacteriophages, bacteria and eukaryotes. The role of phages in the life cycle of V. cholerae has been increasingly recognized and investigated over the past decade. Andrew Camilli and colleagues take us through the exciting evolutionary arms race between V. cholerae and virulent bacteriophages, based both on mechanisms of phage resistance in the bacterium and a unique phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system used to counteract this resistance. Finally, the authors discuss the impact of these predator-prey dynamics in the context of infection, and their use as a strategy to limit cholera transmission within a community. In regards to its ability to coexist with other microbes, V. cholerae can produce effectors that are either released to the extracellular media, or delivered via intimate cell-to-cell contact such as those injected via the type VI secretion system (T6SS). The Pukatzki lab reviews the versatility of the T6SS to produce different combinations of such effectors, which establishes the strains of V. cholerae that can co-exist in the environment. After killing a cell, its DNA is released and incorporated by natural competence into other living cells, thereby being a potential source of diversification for V. cholerae's T6SS effectors. Finally, I revisisit the discovery of non-canonical D-amino acids, recently identified effectors secreted by V. cholerae which have increasingly been shown to be important in enhancing the ability of the bacterium to colonize and persist in a particular niche. I focus on recent observations that suggest different D-amino acids influence distinct cellular processes in bacteria, and dis cuss their role in modulating environmental bacterial biodiversity.",Felipe Cava,10.2436/20.1501.01.290,International Microbiology : The Official Journal Of The Spanish Society For Microbiology
[Identification Of Hypoxia-Specific Therapeutic Targets In Multiple Myeloma],"The bone marrow microenvironment is low in oxygen, promoting a hypoxic response which causes myeloma cells to acquire stem cell properties and enhanced therapy resistance. We performed comprehensive gene and microRNA expression analyses of samples from myeloma patients and cell lines cultured under hypoxia. Through this, we identified the histone demethylase KDM3A, the glycolytic enzyme HK2, and microRNA-210 as factors playing important roles in the behavior of cells under hypoxic conditions. These genes were regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF. However, we also found that the expression of IRF4 and MYC, factors required for maintenance of differentiation and proliferation was suppressed by hypoxia. This suggests that the regulatory factors that induce drug resistance and the anti-apoptotic capacity of myeloma cells fluctuate with the partial pressure of oxygen in their environment. Based on this premise, a dual treatment strategy in which a dominant clone and a dormant clone adapted to the hypoxic microenvironment are treated simultaneously with orthogonal drugs is a potentially viable strategy to achieve a cure for multiple myeloma.",Sho Ikeda,10.11406/rinketsu.62.305,[Rinsho Ketsueki] The Japanese Journal Of Clinical Hematology

Clusterin: A Double-Edged Sword In Cancer And Neurological Disorders,"Clusterin is a ubiquitously expressed glycoprotein that is involved in a whole range of biological processes. This protein is known to promote tumor survival and resistance to therapy in cancer, which contrasts sharply with its neuroprotective functions in various neurological diseases. This duality has led to recent investigations into the potential therapeutic applications of clusterin inhibition, particularly in cancer treatment. Inhibition of clusterin has been shown to be able to induce cancer cell senescence, suppress their growth and increase their sensitivity to therapy. The involvement of clusterin in the aging process makes its biological effects even more complex and offers a broad perspective for research and therapeutic exploration of various pathological conditions. This review critically examines the multiple functions of clusterin in cancer and neurological disorders and addresses the controversies surrounding its role in these areas. The assessment includes an in-depth analysis of the existing literature and examining the relationship of clusterin to fundamental aspects of cancer progression, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance. In addition, the review addresses the neurobiological implications of clusterin and examines its controversial role in neuroprotection, neurodegeneration, and synaptic plasticity. Attention is also paid to the epigenetic regulation of clusterin expression. By clarifying conflicting findings and discrepancies in the literature, this review aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying clusterin functions and its potential clinical implications in both cancer and neurodisorders.

BsAb has higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional antibodies, with special functions such as recruitment of immune cells and blocking of dual signaling pathways, playing an important role in immune-diagnosis and therapy. With the deterioration of the global environment and the irregular living habits of people, the incidence of tumor is becoming higher and higher. Tumor becomes the most serious fatal disease threatening human health after cardiovascular disease. There are 12 million estimated new tumor cases each year worldwide. The major clinical treatments of tumor are surgical resection, chemoradiotherapy, target therapy. Tumor immunotherapy is a novel approach for tumor treatment in recent years, and activates human immune system to control and kill tumor cells. Although the traditional monoclonal antibodies have already acquired some therapeutic effects in tumor targeted therapy and immunotherapy, they induce drug resistance resulted from the heterogeneity and plasticity of tumors. Binding to two target antigens at the same time, BsAb has been used in the clinical treatment of tumors and obtained promising outcomes. This review elaborates the research progress and applications of bispecific antibody in clinical tumor therapy.","Luyao Wang, Zhenhua Wei, Weijia Xiong, Suhang Bai, Changyuan Yu, Zhao Yang",10.13345/j.cjb.200327,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao = Chinese Journal Of Biotechnology
[Genetic Regulatory Mechanisms Of Candida Albicans Biofilm Formation],"Candida albicans is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans. Phenotypic plasticity is a typical biological feature of C. albicans, which is associated with pathogenicity, host adaptation, and sexual reproduction. Biofilm of C. albicans is a complex community formed by different morphological types of cells (yeast, hyphae and pseudohyphae) and secreted extracellular matrix. C. albicans biofilms are intrinsically resistant to antifungal drugs, the host immune system, and environmental stresses. Biofilm is an important virulence factor and a major clinical challenge. With the development of new technologies in global gene expression profiles and genetic manipulation, the regulatory mechanisms that govern C. albicans biofilm development and drug resistance become more and more clear. Major regulatory mechanisms involve the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators such as Bcr1 and Tec1. In addition, morphological transitions and sexual reproduction are also involved in the regulation of biofilm development. In this review, we focus on the genetic regulatory mechanisms of biofilm including the roles of cell-wall related proteins, transcription factors, and the MTL locus. In the last section, we also summarize the mechanisms of drug resistance of biofilm in C. albicans.","Dongdong Guo, Huizhen Yue, Yujia Wei, Guanghua Huang",10.13345/j.cjb.170122,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao = Chinese Journal Of Biotechnology
Cancer Stem Cell Targeted Therapies,"In normal dividing tissues, cell homeostasis is maintained by rare cellular elements, the stem cells, that have the unique property of self-renewal and differentiation to generate a population of functionally mature tissue elements. Recent studies carried out in the last three decades support the existence of stem cells also in tumors, the so-called cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells have the property of initiating and maintaining tumor growth, are able to self-renew and to differentiate, are the main drivers of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and the main cellular mediators of drug resistance, leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Cancer stem cells can be identified in many tumors according to specific immunophenotypic features, but cancer stemness cannot be defined as a fixed property, due to cancer plasticity. For these properties, cancer stem cells represent attractive targets for developing new anti-cancer therapies and there is supporting evidence that the combination of conventional anticancer therapies with drugs targeting cancer stem cells could lead to cancer eradication. Ongoing studies in some tumors strongly support the clinical utility of developing efficient strategies of cancer stem cell targeting.","Ugo Testa, Elvira Pelosi, Germana Castelli",10.4415/ANN_20_03_12,Annali Dell'Istituto Superiore Di Sanita
[Preliminary Study On Resistance Mechanism And Virulence Features In Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae From Burn Patients],"Objective: To investigate resistance mechanism and virulence features of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and to provide theoretical foundation for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections in burn wards as well as clinical therapy of CRKP. Methods: Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples of burn patients hospitalized in our unit from February to December 2016 were collected. The diameters of inhibition zone of imipemen or meropenem susceptibility disk of the above strains were≤22 mm. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and automated instrument were applied to test drug resistance of the strains to 17 antibiotics of cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, quinolones, and carbapenems. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze homology of the strains. Crystal violet staining was applied to assess ability of biofilm formation of the strains. The hypermucoviscosity (HM) phenotype of the strains was determined by string test. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect common carbapenemase genes of bla(KPC), bla(IMP), bla(OXA-48), and bla(NDM), capsular serotype genes of K1, K2, and K57, and virulence-associated gene of rmpA. Results: (1) A total of 29 CRKP strains were isolated. The 29 CRKP strains were with high drug resistance rate to carbapenems antibiotics of imipenen, meropenem, and ertapenem, and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones antibiotics, while the strains were with low drug resistance rate to sulfonamides antibiotics and tegafycline. (2) The 29 CRKP strains had 4 types of A, B, C, and D according to PFGE, with 11 strains of type A, 10 strains of type B, 6 strains of type C, and 2 strains of type D. (3) Among the 29 CRKP strains, 25 strains were positive in biofilm formation, with positive rate of 86.2%. (4) None of the 29 CRKP strains was positive in the string test with HM phenotype. (5) All the 29 CRKP strains carried carbapenemase genes. Among the 29 CRKP strains, 11 strains carried both bla(NDM-1) and bla(OXA-48) genes, 1 strain carried both bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) genes, 12 strains only carried bla(KPC-2) gene, and 5 strains only carried bla(NDM-1) gene. The 79.3% (23/29) strains were completely resistant to 3 kinds of carbapenems antibiotics. (6) Among the 29 CRKP strains, 3 strains carried K2 gene, 2 of which were completely resistant to 3 kinds of carbapenems antibiotics, 1 strain carried rmpA gene, and no strain carried K1 or K57 gene. Conclusions: The detection rate of CRKP isolated from burn patients hospitalized in our unit is high. The strains are mostly extensively drug-resistant bacteria, and the mechanism of drug resistance of which is complicated. There may have clonal spread of CRKP. And appropriate measures should be taken timely and effectively to prevent nosocomial spread of CRKP.","Z Chen, J Xiang",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2018.11.015,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns
A Giant Frontal Sinus Mucocele In An Opium Addict Patient: A Case Report,"Mucocele is a benign soft tissue mass that could occur in all accessory glands. Mucocele can also occur in paranasal sinuses. It is mostly placed in the frontal sinus and barely grows larger than 1.5 centimeters(cm). Based on the affected site, it could cause facial pain and headache. Analgesics like opioids could relieve and potentially make patients ignore the headache and cause giant frontal mucocele. This article discusses a patient with giant frontal sinus mucocele (7×8×8 cm) and opium addiction that presented with severe and intolerable pain. A 32 yr old man came to Rajaee Trauma Hospital, Shiraz, Iran with a severe headache and a large swelling of the face frontal region that developed gradually. In physical examination, the mass was non-tender, non-pulsatile, and free from the overlying normal skin. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a frontal sinus mucocele. The operation was planned, and the patient was discharged after two days. Subsequently, the 6-month follow-up of the patient was normal. Two different hypotheses are declared in this article. First, the potential role of opium addiction as a risk factor for giant mucoceles was noted, then the analgesic non-responsiveness of sinus mucoceles was described. The latter hypothesis is more likely. So, we should consider that if the patient had an analgesic-resistant headache, one differential diagnosis could be sinus mucocele. Moreover, the pos sible psychological effect of addiction on discounting face beauty was acknowledged.","Gholamreza Motazedian, Elnaz Koushki, Mehryar Nahaei, Fateme Salari, Hamid Reihani, Ebtesam Jabbari, Alireza Keshtkar",10.52547/wjps.12.2.107,World Journal Of Plastic Surgery

[Further Understanding Of Infection Of Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Among Burn Patients And The Related Strategies For Antimicrobial Treatment],"The prevalence of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP ) in burn wards has become one of the most troublesome issues in current management of bacterial infections. It is necessary for us to reconsider the epidemiology, risk factors and clinical characteristics of CRKP infection as well as therapeutic options. Formulating the principles of antimicrobial therapy of CRKP infection and combined antibiotics therapy and implementing appropriate dosage regimens designed by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will be of importance. Common antimicrobial agents for the treatment of CRKP infection include polymyxins, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and carbapenems. Infection control measures such as contact isolation, active screening, and environmental surface disinfection must be integrated with antimicrobial stewardship to effectively curb and prevent the spread of CRKP.","J Xiang, J N Huan",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2018.11.014,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns

[Plasmids Carried By Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae In Burn Patients And Its Correlation With Strain Transmission],"Objective: To explore the carrier status of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) plasmids in burn patients and analyze the correlation of these plasmids with the transmission of CRKP. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. A total of 26 CRKP strains, which were isolated from the clinic-related samples of 22 burn patients (with 20 males and 2 females, aged (42±16) years) admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University) from January to December 2017, were collected and individually numbered. The plasmids of the strains were extracted by alkali lysis. After determination of the plasmid concentration by a nucleic acid concentration detector, the agarose gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the bands, and rough plasmids typing was performed. The plasmid of the smallest numbered CRKP in each plasmid type was transformed into competent Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain Top10 (hereinafter referred to as TOP10 strain). The growth of each transformed strains and a Top10 strain cultivated in ampicillin containing Luria-Bertani (LB) agar medium overnight was observed, and the proportion of successful transformation was calculated. The plasmids from the smallest numbered plasmid carrying CRKP strain of successfully transformed Top10 strains (hereinafter referred to as the smallest successfully transformed strain) and correspondingly numbered CRKP were extracted, and then, the agarose gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the bands. Aforementioned successfully transformed strains and a TOP10 strain were used for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing with 17 antibiotics commonly used in clinic. The plasmid from the smallest successfully transformed strain was sequenced using the next-generation sequencing technology. Bioinformatics analyses such as protein-coding gene prediction and protein sequence alignment were performed successively. The sequence was subsequently named pKP03-NDM1 according to the carrying of drug resistance gene. According to the whole genome sequence of the plasmid carried by the smallest successfully transformed strain, the polymerase chain reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis, and gene sequencing were used to detect the New Delhi metallo-beta lactamase-1 (blaNDM-1) of plasmids in the remaining 25 strains of CRKP. The ST typing in multilocus sequence typing of 26 strains of CRKP was analyzed based on the literature. Results: Plasmids were successfully extracted from 26 CRKP, with mass concentrations ranging from 19.3 to 189.8 ng/μL. Each of the 26 CRKP carrying plasmids showed at least one band longer than 2 500 bp in the agarose gel electrophoresis, which were roughly divided into 6 patterns of A, B, C, D, E, and F. After overnight cultivation, no growth of strains was observed in LB agar medium containing ampicillin inoculated with the TOP10 strain or TOP10 strains transformed by the plasmid of CRKP patterning A, B, D, or E. In contrast, TOP10 strains transformed by the pattern C plasmid from NO.3 CRKP and the pattern F plasmid from NO.15 CRKP resulted in numerous colony growths, and those transformed strains were named as TOP10-pKP03 and TOP10-pKP15, respectively. The proportion of successful transformation was 1/3. The plasmid carried by TOP10-pKP03 showed a single band in the agarose gel electrophoresis, which was the same size as the largest band of the plasmid from NO.3 CRKP. The TOP10 strain was sensitive to the 17 antibiotics commonly used in clinic. TOP10-pKP03 and TOP10-pKP15 were resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems but remained sensitive to monocyclic β-lactam, aminoglycosides, quinolones and tigecycline. The full length of the plasmid carried by TOP10-pKP03 was 41 190 bp. In addition to blaNDM-1, this plasmid carried bleMBL, T4SS, bleomycin resistance gene, conjugation transfer elements, and relaxase, etc. The plasmid showed 99% nucleotide identity similarity and the same length to the plasmid pJN24NDM1 extracted from an E. coli isolate JN24. Totally 16 (61.5%) CRKP were confirmed to carrying blaNDM-1 gene, among the ST typing of the 16 strains, 11 strains were ST11, while ST215, ST260, ST395, ST2230, and new ST had 1 strain each. Among the ST typing of 10 blaNDM-1-negative CRKP, 8 strains were ST11, while ST395 and ST2230 had 1 strain each. Conclusions: A blaNDM-1 gene carrying plasmid pKP03-NDM1 was extracted and sequenced from CRKP isolated from burn patients, with a high plasmid carrying rate. Meanwhile, this plasmid may mediate inter-CRKP and CRKP-E. coli horizontal transfer of blaNDM-1, leading to transmission of antimicrobial resistance.","S Y Huang, Y L Gong, D P Zhou, L L Jiang, L J Xiang, Z H Chen, D L Wang, G T Huang",10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20210930-00343,Zhonghua Shao Shang Yu Chuang Mian Xiu Fu Za Zhi

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. An analysis was performed on the data of 3 067 hospitalized pediatric patients with burns who met the inclusion criteria and were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University) from January 2012 to December 2020, including gender, age, causative factors, locations and severities of burns, seasons of accidents, and the type, source of tissue or body fluid, and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria. API bacterial identification batten and automatic microbial identification system were applied for pathogen identification. Drug sensitivities of top 3 consistent ratio pathogen identifed were tested with minimum inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion method. WHONET 5.6 software was applied to analyze the data. Results: There were 3 067 hospitalized pediatric patients with burns, including 1 768 boys and 1 299 girls. The majority of pediatric burn patients were >1 and ≤4 years, accounting for 72.9% (2 236/3 067), and the minority of pediatric burn patients were >8 and ≤12 years, accounting for 4.9% (150/3 067). Moderate burns and severe burns of pediatric burn patients accounted for the majority parts, and the proportions of the two were close. The top cause of pediatric burns was scald, accounting for 81.6% (2504/3 067). Extremities were the most common burn sites in that of entire 3 254. The most pediatric burns occurred in winter, accounting for 29.4% (903/3 067). A total of 1 018 strains of pathogenic bacteria were collected from pediatric burn patients, all of which were non-repeated isolates. The pathogens with top five consistent ratio were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli, among which Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first every year. The pathogens were mainly isolated from the wound exudate, accounting for 81.34% (828/1 018). Staphylococcus aureus from 2012 to 2020 showed no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid or teicoplanin while Staphylococcus aureus isolated in 2019 was 100% resistant to macrolides, penicillin, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not resistant to polymyxin B. Acinetobacter baumannii showed a high rate of drug resistance to most antibiotics.

[A Single Center Study On Antimicrobial Use And Bacterial Resistance In Burn Ward],"Objective: To investigate the effect of antibiotics on bacterial resistance through analyzing the use of common antibiotics and the bacterial prevalence in single-center burn ward. Methods: The epidemiological data of pathogenic bacteria and the use of common antibiotics in burn ward of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College was investigated in the past 9 years. Bacteria samples were collected from the wounds, catheters, blood, feces, urine and sputum of inpatients in the unit from January 2010 to December 2018. The antibiotics use density was calculated by defined daily doses (DDDs)/(1 000 patient-days). Results: (1) In the proportion of bacteria detected, Staphylococcus aureus was the first and sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumonia (19.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (11.5%) were the top three Gram-negative bacteria in 2018; the proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly increased (R(2)=0.861, P<0.001). (2) The Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (R(2)=0.447, P=0.049) and ciprofloxacin (R(2)=0.663, P=0.008) increased significantly. The Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to piperacillin (R(2)=0.999, P=0.018), meropenem (R(2)=0.999, P=0.023), ciprofloxacin (R(2)=1.000, P=0.010) increased significantly. There was no significant trend in the Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate. (3) The use density of meropenem increased significantly (R(2)=0.492, P=0.035), and that of ciprofloxacin decreased significantly (R(2)=0.572, P=0.018). (4) Carbapenems use density was positively correlated with resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefoperazone sulbactam (r=0.733, P=0.025), piperacillin tazobactam (r=0.684, P=0.042), cefuroxime (r=0.821, P=0.023), ceftazidime (r=0.741, P=0.022), imipenem (r=0.718, P=0.029), meropenem (r=0.690, P=0.040), amikacin (r=0.750, P=0.020). (5) Ciprofloxacin use density was negatively correlated with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (r=-0.751, P=0.020), Ciprofloxacin (r=-0.873, P=0.002) and with the Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to cefuroxime (r=-0.767, P=0.044), ceftazidime (r=-0.712, P=0.031), imipenem (r=-0.780, P=0.013), meropenem (r=-0.793, P=0.011), ciprofloxacin (r=-0.871, P=0.002), Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (r=-0.793, P=0.011).

Methods: (1) In 2018, pan-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae UA168 (hereinafter referred to as the host bacteria) solution isolated from the blood of a burn patient in Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (hereinafter referred to as Ruijin Hospital) was used to isolate and purify the bacteriophage against pan-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from the sewage of Ruijin Hospital with sewage co-culture method, drip plate method, and double-agar plate method. The bacteriophage was named as phage KP168 and the plaque morphology was observed. (2) The phage KP168 solution was taken for cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and dialysis, and then the morphology of phage KP168 was observed through transmission electron microscope after phosphotungstic acid negative staining. (3) The phage KP168 solution was taken to determine the lytic ability of the phage KP168 against 20 strains of pan-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the burned patients' blood in Ruijin Hospital by the drip plate method, and then the lysis rate was calculated. (4) The phage KP168 solution at a initial titer of 9.3×10(11) plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL (400 μL per tube) and the host bacteria solution at a concentration of 1×10(9) colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL (4 mL per tube) were conventionally shaking cultured together for 4 hours at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.000, 1.000, 0.100, 0.010, or 0.001, respectively (1 tube per MOI). The titer of phage KP168 was measured by the double-agar plate method (the measurement method was the same below) to select the optimal MOI. The experiment was repeated three times. (5) The host bacteria solution at a concentration of 1×10(9) CFU/mL (4 mL per tube) and the phage KP168 solution at an adjusted titer of 5×10(7) PFU/mL (400 μL per tube) were mixed at the MOI of 0.005. The plaques were counted 0 (immediately), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, and 30 minutes (1 tube at each time point) after mixing by the double-agar plate method (the counting method was the same below), and the percentage of adsorbed phages was calculated to screen for the optimal adsorption time. The experiment was repeated three times. (6) The host bacteria solution at a concentration of 1×10(9) CFU/mL (300 μL per tube) and the phage KP168 solution at a titer of 5×10(8) PFU/mL (60 μL per tube) were mixed at MOI of 0.005 and conventionally shaking cultured after standing for the optimal adsorption time. The phage KP168 titer was measured 0 (immediately), 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 minutes after culture, and a one-step growth curve was drawn. The experiment was repeated three times. (7) The phage KP168 solution at a titer of 2.5×10(10) PFU/mL was left to stand for 1 hour at 37, 40, 50, 60, or 70 ℃ (3 tubes at each time point, 1 mL per tube) for counting the plaques, and then the thermal stability curve was drawn. SM buffer at a pH values of 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.4, 8.0, 9.0, or 10.0 were added to the phage KP168 solution at a titer of 3.0×10(10) PFU/mL, respectively. The mixed solution was left to stand for 1 hour at 37 ℃ (3 tubes of each pH, each tube containing 100 μL phage KP168 solution and 900 μL SM buffer), and then the plaques were counted, and an acid-base stability curve was drawn. (8) The phage KP168 solution was taken for DNA extraction and sequencing after dialysis as in experiment (2). The whole genome was annotated with Prokka to obtain the coding sequence of phage KP168. Nucleotide's BLAST function was used to proceed nucleic acid sequence alignment for finding a known phage with the highest similarity to the phage KP168 nucleic acid sequence, and Blastx function was used to translate the coding sequence into protein for its function prediction. The comparison with Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database and Virulence Factors Database was proceeded. (9) In a 96-well plate, at a MOI of 1.000, 0.100, 0.010 or 0.001 (3 wells per MOI), 20 μL phage KP168 solution at a initial titer of 5.8×10(10) PFU/mL was added to 200 μL host bacteria solution at a concentration of 1.5×10(8) CFU/mL (the same concentration below) for co-cultivation for 48 hours. After 200 μL host bacteria solution was left to stand for 48 hours, 20 μL phage KP168 solution at a titer of 1×10(6,) 1×10(7,) 1×10(8,) 1×10(9,) or 1×10(10) PFU/mL (3 wells per titer) was added respectively for action for 4 hours. In both experiments, 200 μL host bacteria solution added with 20 μL SM buffer (3 wells) acted as a negative control, and 220 μL LB culture medium (3 wells) acted as a blank control. Absorbance values were measured by a microplate reader, and inhibition/destruction rates of biofilm were calculated. The experiments were both repeated three times. Results: (1) The plaques of phage KP168 successfully isolated and purified were transparent and round, and its diameter was approximately 1.5 mm. (2) The phage KP168 has a regular polyhedron structure with a diameter of about 50 nm and without a tail. (3) The phage KP168 could lyse 13 of 20 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae from burned patients, with a lysis rate of 65.0%. (4) When MOI was 1.000, the titer was the highest after co-culturing the phage KP168 with the host bacteria for 4 hours, which was the optimal MOI. (5) After the mixing of the phage KP168 with the host bacteria for 4 minutes, the percentage of the adsorbed phage reached the highest, which was the optimal adsorption time. (6) The one-step growth curve showed that during the lysis of the host bacteria by phage KP168, the incubation period was about 10 minutes, and the lysis period was about 40 minutes. (7) With the condition of 40 ℃ or pH 7.4, the number of plaques and the activity of phage KP168 reached the highest. (8) The genome of phage KP168 was a linear double-stranded DNA with a length of 40 114 bp. There were 48 possible coding sequences. It had the highest similarity to Klebsiella phage_vB_Kp1. The most similar known proteins corresponding to the translated proteins of coding sequences contained 23 hypothetical proteins and 25 proteins with known functions. No resistance genes or virulence factor genes were found. The GeneBank accession number was KT367885. (9) After 48 hours of co-cultivation of the phage KP168 and the host bacteria at each MOI, the inhibition rates of biofilm were similar, with an average of about 45%. After the phage KP168 with a titer of 1×10(9) PFU/mL acted on the biofilm formed by the host bacteria for 4 h, the destruction rate of biofilm was the highest, reaching an average of 42%. Conclusions: In this study, a bacteriophage against pan-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from a burn patient, phage KP168, is isolated from sewage, which belongs to the tailless phage. It has a wide host spectrum, short adsorption time, and short incubation period, with certain thermal and acid-base stability. Its genomic information is clear, and it does not contain resistance genes or virulence factor genes. It also has an inhibitory effect on the formation of bacterial biofilm and a destructive effect on the formed bacterial biofilm.","Z Y Qi, S Y Yang, S W Dong, F F Zhao, J H Qin, J Xiang",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2020.01.004,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns
[Analysis Of Drug Resistance Of Acinetobacter Baumannii In Wound Of Children With Traffic Injury And Its Relationship With Antibiotic Use],"Objective: To know the drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) in wound of children with traffic injury and its relationship with antibiotic use. Methods: Wound exudate of 226 children with traffic injury admitted to our unit from January 2010 to December 2015 were collected. API bacteria identification panels and fully automatic microbiological identification system were used to identify pathogens. Kirby-Bauer paper disk diffusion method was used to detect the drug resistance of pathogens to 18 antibiotics including amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, and imipenem. The detection situation of pathogen of children's wounds and drug resistance of detected AB to 18 antibiotics in each year were collected. Forty-six AB positive children (2 children excluded) were divided into imipenem-resistant group (IR, n=19) and non imipenem-resistant group (NIR, n=25) according to whether AB was 100% resistant to imipenem. Drug resistance of AB in wounds of children to 18 antibiotics in two groups was compared. The antibiotic use of AB positive children was collected, and the antibiotic use intensity of children in two groups was compared. Data were processed with Fisher's exact test, independent sample t test, and corrected t test. Results: (1) The detection rates of pathogen in wounds of children in 2010-2015 were 95.6% (43/45), 89.8% (53/59), 81.3% (148/182), 81.1% (107/132), 81.6% (120/147), and 77.5% (62/80), respectively, showing a trend of decreasing year by year. A total of 665 strains and 75 pathogens were detected, and the top 5 pathogens with detection rate from high to low were AB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, respectively. (2) Drug resistance rates of AB to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, aztreonam, and piperacillin were all 100%, while AB was 100% sensitive to polymyxin, and the total drug resistance rates of AB to the other 13 antibiotics were all above 50%. The drug resistance rate of AB in wounds of children to piperacillin was higher than that to piperacillin/tazobactam in 2010-2015. (3) Except for imipenem, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, aztreonam, piperacillin, and polymyxin, the drug resistance rates of AB in wounds of children in group IR to the other 12 antibiotics were higher than those in group NIR (with P values below 0.01). Besides, AB strains in wounds of children in group IR were completely resistant to at least 3 kinds of antibiotics including carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, so that they were multidrug-resistant AB. (4) A total of 32 antibiotics were used in 46 AB positive children, and the 10-top-used antibiotics with use intensity from high to low were cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, imipenem, ceftizoxime, amoxycillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, amoxycillin/sulbactam, and cefmetazole, respectively. (5) Twenty-one antibiotics were not included in the comparison because of their small amount of usage. For the other 11 antibiotics, only the use intensity of metronidazole of children in two groups was statistically different (t=-3.104, P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in total antibiotic use of children in two groups (t=0.368, P>0.05). Conclusions: AB is one of the main pathogens in wounds of children with traffic injury, with high drug resistant rate. The high intensity of antibiotic use may lead to its drug resistance. In this study, the top-used antibiotics were in accord with AB resistant drugs, indicating a lack of normative use of antibiotics.","S Liu, C Wang, Y X Fu",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2017.07.002,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns

[Analysis Of Genomic Information And Biological Characteristics Of A Bacteriophage Against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus In Patients With Median Sternal Incision Infection],"Objective: To isolate and purify a bacteriophage against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to analyze its genomic information and biological characteristics. Methods: The experimental research methods were adopted. MRSA (hereinafter referred to as host bacteria) solution was collected from the wound of a 63-year-old female patient with the median sternum incision infection admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University). The bacteriophage, named bacteriophage SAP23 was isolated and purified from the sewage of the Hospital by sewage co-culture method and double-layer agar plate method, and the plaque morphology was observed. The morphology of bacteriophage SAP23 was observed by transmission electron microscope after phosphotungstic acid negative staining. The whole genome of bacteriophage SAP23 was sequenced with NovaSeq PE15 platform after its DNA was prepared by sodium dodecyl sulfonate/protease cleavage scheme, and genomic analysis including sequence assembly, annotation, and phylogenetic tree were completed. The bacteriophage SAP23 solution was co-incubated with the host bacterial solution for 4 h at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.000 0, 1.000 0, 0.100 0, 0.010 0, 0.001 0, and 0.000 1, respectively, and then the bacteriophage titer was measured by the drip plate method to select the optimal MOI, with here and the following sample numbers of 3. The bacteriophage SAP23 solution was co-incubated with the host bacterial solution at the optimal MOI for 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively, and the bacteriophage titer was measured by the same method as mentioned above to select the optimal adsorption time. After the bacteriophage SAP23 solution was co-incubated with the host bacterial solution at the optimal MOI for the optimal adsorption time, the bacteriophage titers were measured by the same method as mentioned above at 0 (immediately), 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min after culture, respectively, and a one-step growth curve was drawn. The bacteriophage SAP23 solution was incubated at 4, 37, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ℃ and pH 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 for 1 h, respectively, to determine its stability. A total of 41 MRSA strains stored in the Department of Microbiology of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University) were used to determine the host spectrum of bacteriophage SAP23. Results: The bacteriophage SAP23 could form a transparent plaque on the host bacteria double-layer agar plate. The bacteriophage SAP23 has a polyhedral head with (88±4) nm in diameter and a tail with (279±21) nm in length and (22.6±2.6) nm in width. The bacteriophage SAP23 has a linear, double-stranded DNA with a full length of 151 618 bp and 11 681 bp long terminal repeats sequence in the sequence ends. There were 220 open reading frames predicted and the bacteriophage could encode 4 transfer RNAs, while no resistance genes or virulence factors were found. The annotation function of bacteriophage SAP23 genes could be divided into 5 groups. The GenBank accession number was MZ427930. According to the genomic collinearity analysis, there were 5 local collinear blocks in the whole genome between the bacteriophage SAP23 and the chosen 6 Staphylococcus bacteriophages, while within or outside the local collinear region, there were still some differences. The bacteriophage SAP23 belonged to the Herelleviridae family, Twortvirinae subfamily, and Kayvirus genus. The optimal MOI of bacteriophage SAP23 was 0.010 0, and the optimal adsorption time was 10 min. The bacteriophage SAP23 had a latent period of 20 min, and a growth phase of 80 min. The bacteriophage SAP23 was able to remain stable at the temperature between 4 and 37 ℃ and at the pH values between 4 and 9. The bacteriophage SAP23 could lyse 3 of the 41 tested MRSA strains. Conclusions: The bacteriophage SAP23 is a member of the Herelleviridae family, Twortvirinae subfamily, and Kayvirus genus. The bacteriophage SAP23 has a good tolerance for temperature and acid-base and a short latent period, and can lyse MRSA effectively. The bacteriophage SAP23 is a new type of potent narrow-spectrum bacteriophage without virulence factors and resistance genes.","J Zhang, R S Yan, Z C Yang, X Shi, X Li, T C Mao, Y M Zhang",10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20211130-00400,Zhonghua Shao Shang Yu Chuang Mian Xiu Fu Za Zhi
Antimicrobial Drug Resistance In Fish Pathogens,"Major concerns surround the use of antimicrobial agents in farm-raised fish, including the potential impacts these uses may have on the development of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in fish and the aquatic environment. Currently, some antimicrobial agents commonly used in aquaculture are only partially effective against select fish pathogens due to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Although reports of ineffectiveness in aquaculture due to resistant pathogens are scarce in the literature, some have reported mass mortalities in Penaeus monodon larvae caused by Vibrio harveyi resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin. Genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance have been described in aquaculture environments and are commonly found on mobile genetic elements which are recognized as the primary source of antimicrobial resistance for important fish pathogens. Indeed, resistance genes have been found on transferable plasmids and integrons in pathogenic bacterial species in the genera Aeromonas, Yersinia, Photobacterium, Edwardsiella, and Vibrio. Class 1 integrons and IncA/C plasmids have been widely identified in important fish pathogens (Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Photobacterium spp., Edwardsiella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and are thought to play a major role in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance determinants in the aquatic environment. The identification of plasmids in terrestrial pathogens (Salmonella enterica serotypes, Escherichia coli, and others) which have considerable homology to plasmid backbone DNA from aquatic pathogens suggests that the plasmid profiles of fish pathogens are extremely plastic and mobile and constitute a considerable reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes for pathogens in diverse environments.","Miller, Ra; Harbottle, H",10.1128/microbiolspec.ARBA-0017-2017,Microbiology Spectrum
Molecular Detection Of The Beta-Lactamase Cefotaxime Gene In Escherichia Coli From The Reproductive Tract Of Bali Cattle With Repeat Breeder Cases On Lombok Island,"This study aims to detect Escherichia coli which encodes beta-lactamase Cefotaxime (blaCTX-M) gene from the reproductive tract of Bali cattle with repeat breeder cases. This research was conducted from June to August 2021 using 16 Bali cattle with repeat breeder cases. The reproductive fluids were taken using a plastic sheet gun which was inserted into a Brain Heart Infusion medium, isolated in eosin-methylene blue agar (EMB) and identified using biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of E. coli was carried out using the disc diffusion method. Double-disk approximation test was used to screen the presence of E. coli which produces Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect the blaCTX-M gene of E. coli and sequences of the blaCTX-M gene were phylogenetically analyzed. The research results obtained three E. coli isolates from 16 reproductive tract fluids of Bali cattle. Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that 100% of E. coli was resistant to penicillin G and oxytetracycline. 66.66% of E. coli was resistant to cefotaxime (CTX) and gentamicin, and 33.33% of E. coli was resistant to tetracycline. Escherichia coli isolates that were resistant to penicillin and CTX showed positive results in the double-disk approximation test. The results of E. coli detection using PCR showed that three E. coli isolates encoded the blaCTX-M gene located at 370 bp on gel electrophoresis. The results of the phylogenetic analysis showed that E. coli from the reproductive tract of Bali cattle was related to E. coli that encoded blaCTX-M-14 14 isolated from humans.

Wastes And Surfaces As Reservoir Of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria In Nigeria,"Introduction: Acquisition of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram negative bacteria from environmental sources and surfaces is widely reported in Nigeria. Objectives: A study was designed to assess the role of discharged environmental wastes, hands and frequently shared and touched surfaces as potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistant pathogens. Methods: A total of 818 samples of wastes which include sewage, sullage, diapers, food remnants, sands, plastics, water sachets, and swabs of restroom floors, corridors, door handle, bowls and hands of vulnerable and non vulnerable children (VC and NVC) were analyzed and susceptibility of isolates recovered from them to different antibiotics were determined. The moderately resistant S. aureus and Gram negative bacilli were further screened for methicilin resistance and ESBL production. Results: Result showed that sewage, sullage, diapers, food remnants and restroom floors were frequently contaminated with PPB that are highly and moderately resistant to penicillins and flouroquinolones. Nearly all the isolates were susceptible to a carbapenem and cephalosporins. Hands and high-touch surfaces of VC such as bowl were contaminated with E. coli, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. No ESBL-E. coli was isolated from all the samples. Two ESBL-K.pneumoniae, 2 MRSA and 1 ESBL- P. aeruginosa were recovered from VC bowls, sewage, sullage, and diapers. Conclusion: Sewage, sullage, some solid wastes, restroom floors, VC's hand, and their bowl serve as potential reservoir for some resistant bacteria.","Yusuf I., Muhammad Damji Z., Danladi Shuaibu M., Hamza N., Abdullahi Bako N.",10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
"Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern Of Bacterial Isolates And Associated Factors For Bacteriuria Among Cancer Patients Attending Ocean Road Cancer Institute, Tanzania","Background: Cancer patients are among people at high risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing bacteriuria as a consequence of cancer-induced immunosuppression and complex cancer treatments. Methodology: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving the quantitative method of data collection was carried out to determine the prevalence of bacteriuria, antibacterial susceptibility pattern of the causative isolates and associated risk factors among cancer patients attending Ocean Road Cancer Institute. A convenient sampling technique was used to obtain 422 cancer patients. A urine sample was collected to establish the prevalence of bacteriuria and the antibacterial susceptibility pattern of the isolates. Interviews were carried out with study participants using a questionnaire to collect social-demographic data. A clinical record collection form was used to collect clinical data of each participant. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics (mean, frequencies and proportions) and binary logistic regression by using SPSS software version 20. Results: The prevalence of bacteriuria among asymptomatic and symptomatic cancer patients was 3.6% and 14.0%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for a large proportion of all Gram-negative bacteria isolates (53%). The other Gram-negative bacteria were Pseudomonas species (16%), Acinetobacter species (15%), Klebsiella species (10%), Enterobacter species (3%), Proteus mirabilis (1.5%), and Aeromonas species (1.5%). Enterococcus species contributed roughly two-thirds of all Gram-positive bacteria isolates (67%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was found in 27 (75%) of Escherichia coli isolates. The factors associated with bacteriuria in cancer patients were sex, patients’ settings, history of antibiotic use and occupation. Conclusion: Bacteriuria, particularly that caused by MDR Escherichia coli, is common among cancer patients at Ocean Road Cancer Institute and is associated with sex, patients’ settings and occupation.","Abdallah M., Mauki I.I., Lyamuya E.",10.4314/thrb.v25i1.11,Tanzania Journal Of Health Research
Surveillance Of Gram-Positive Cocci Infections And Drug Resistance,"In this study, the prevalence of gram-positive cocci isolates and the characteristics of multiple drug resistances in patients were investigated. Antibiotic resistances were determined in the clinical microbiology laboratory with the methodology of the CLSI (2012). The software WHONET5.4 and SPSS13.0 were used for statistical analysis. There were a total of 6211 gram-positive cocci isolates, comprised of 2255 (36.3%) coagulase (-) staphylococci, 1277 (20.6%) staphylococci aureus, 1109 (17.9%) enterococcus faecalis, and 1045 (16.8%) enterococcus faecium. The proportion of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 16.6% (212/1277). Methicillin resistant coagulase (-) staphylococci (MRCNS) was 14.1% (318/2255). There were no strains in isolated enterococci resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Among the majority of all monitored antibiotics, methicillin resistant staphylococci has much higher drug resistance rate than methicillin sensitive staphylococci (p<0.05).

Analysis Of Distribution And Drug Resistance Of Pathogens In Burned Patients,"Objective • To provide guidance for the rational usage of antibiotics, reduction of drug-resistant strains and hospital infection control by investigating the distribution and drug resistance of pathogens isolated from burned patients. Methods • Isolates from burned patients of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2017 were collected. The VITEK 2 Compact automatic microbial analysis system and K-B disc diffusion method were used for antimicrobial susceptibility test. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the type of specimens and strains and the resistance rates of major pathogens. Chi-square test was used to compare the changes of the detection rates and drug resistance rates of major pathogens between 2016-2017 and 2013-2014. Results • A total of 1 053 isolates were isolated, and most of them (73.88%) were from wounds. Among them, 609 (57.83%) isolates were gram-negative bacilli (G-B), 422 (40.08%) were gram-positive cocci (G+C) and 9 (0.85%) were fungi. The most common pathogen of G-B was Klebsiella pneumoniae (218, 20.70%) in 2016-2017, the proportion of which was significantly higher than that in 2013-2014 (114, 10.72%) (P=0.000). The most common pathogen of G+C was Staphylococcus aureus (210, 19.94%), the proportion of which was significantly higher than that in 2013-2014 (200, 18.81%) (P=0.009). K. pneumoniae showed low resistance only to piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem, meropenem, fosfomycin and tigecycline (<60%), but high resistance to ampicillin and cefazolin (>90%). The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem and amikacin in 2016-2017 were significantly higher than those in 2013-2014 (P<0.05). S. aureus was only resistant highly to penicillin (94.63%) and 100% susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 59.05% in 2016-2017, which had no statistical difference compared with that in 2013-2014 (P=0.412). Conclusion • The most two prevalent isolates from burned patients were K. pneumoniae and S. aureus with multi-drug resistance. Improved management and rational use of antibiotics can reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, and it's still important to keep routine surveillance on pathogens isolated from burned patients for control and prevention of nosocomial infections.","Xu Z.-P., Wang S., Mi C.-R., Han L.-Z., Wang W.-K.",10.3969/j.issn.1674-8115.2019.03.013,Journal Of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Medical Science)
Analysis Of Distribution And Drug Resistance Of Pathogenic Bacteria In Burn Wards,"Objective: To analyze changes in the type distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from burn wards and to provide evidence for rational use of antibiotics, reduction of drug-resistant isolates, and hospital infection control. Methods: Isolates from burn patients were collected from January 2011 to December 2014. Statistical analysis of infection sources, type distribution, and changes in resistance rates of main pathogens during the four year period was performed. Results: A total of 2 399 isolates were collected, including 1 286 (53.61%) gram-negative bacilli (G-b), 1 088 (45.35%) gram-positive cocci (G+c), and 25 (1.04%) fungi. The most common G-b pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (447, 34.76%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (369, 28.69%). The most common G(+)c pathogen and fungus were Staphylococcus aureus (489, 44.94%) and Candida albicans (8, 33.33%), respectively. In the last two years, the detection rates of S.aureus and A.baumannii were significantly lower and the detection rate of P.aeruginosa was significantly higher than those in the first two years (P<0.05). P.aeruginosa and A.baumannii showed high resistance (>80%) to the third and fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and quinolones, but the changes were not statistically significant (P>0.05). S.aureus was only highly resistant to penicillin (97.58%) and was 100% susceptible to vancomycin. Its resistance rates toward cefazolin, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and rifampin decreased significantly (P<0.05). The detection rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) dropped from 72.28% to 63.00%. Conclusion: Many types of drug resistant bacteria were detected in burn wards. The drug resistance problem was serious. Improving management and rational use of antibiotics can reduce the occurrence of drug-resistant bacteria and increase the efficacy of clinical anti-infective treatment and nosocomial infection control.","Xu Z.-P., Wang S., Han L.-Z., Wang W.-K.",10.3969/j.issn.1674-8115.2017.04.021,Journal Of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Medical Science)
The Mir27B-Ccng1-P53-Mir-508-5P Axis Regulates Multidrug Resistance Of Gastric Cancer,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) correlates with treatment failure and poor prognosis among gastric cancer (GC) patients. In a previous study using high-throughput functional screening, we identified 11 microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MDR in GC and found that miR-508-5p reversed MDR by targeting ABCB1 and ZNRD1. However, the mechanism by which miR-508-5p was decreased in chemo-resistant GC cells was unclear. In this study, we found that ectopic miR-27b is sufficient to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, miR-27b directly targets the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of CCNG1, a well-known negative regulator of P53 stability. Interestingly, miR-27b up-regulation leads to increased miR-508-5p expression, and this phenomenon is mediated by CCNG1 and P53. Further investigation indicated that miR-508-5p is directly regulated by P53. Thus, the miR-27b/CCNG1/P53/miR-508-5p axis plays important roles in GC-associated MDR. In addition, miR-27b and miR-508-5p expression was detected in GC tissues with different chemo-sensitivities, and we found that tissues in which miR-27b and miR-508-5p are up-regulated are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Together, these data suggest that the combination of miR-27b and miR-508-5p represents a potential marker of MDR. Restoring the miR-27b and miR-508-5p levels might contribute to MDR reversion in future clinical practice.","Shang Y., Feng B., Zhou L., Ren G., Zhang Z., Fan X., Sun Y., Luo G., Liang J., Wu K., Nie Y., Fan D.",10.18632/ONCOTARGET.6374,Oncotarget
A Current View On The Phenotypic Antibiotic Resistance Of Leading Pathogens In Wounded Patients During The War In Ukraine,"Background and aim: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of antibacterial drugs through cluster analysis of antibiotic sensitivity data from clinical isolates of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp., obtained from soft tissue wounds and burn injuries. Methods: The cohort included 76 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. obtained from 141 patients (male – 95,04 %; female – 4,96 %) with combined injuries of soft tissues and burns. The mean age of patients was 38,57±10,90 years. The final identification of the obtained isolates was carried using MALDI-ToF (Bruker). The sensitivity of clinical isolates to antibacterial drugs was determined using the standard Kirby-Bauer method. Extended antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed to measure the minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against the studied. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the Ward method. Results: The high level of resistance formation was observed among representatives of this Acinetobacter genus. We found the highest level of resistance in P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. The lowest proportions of resistant Pseudomonas spp. were observed for meropenem and tobramycin. Cluster analysis of susceptibility data for P. aeruginosa isolates resulted in the division of antibiotics into two clusters that differ significantly from each other. The isolated A. baumannii strains showed susceptible to a higher number of antibacterial drugs compared to P. aeruginosa. Conclusions: Clinical isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa obtained from patients with combined soft tissue injuries and burns in Ukraine in 2022 exhibit a high level of multidrug resistance. Cluster analysis results indicate that only tobramycin potentially retains efficacy against A. baumannii isolates. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa demonstrate susceptible to tobramycin and meropenem.

Analysis Of Main Clinical Features And Pathogenic Bacteria Of Lacrimal Tracheitis,"AIM: To investigate the main clinical features, pathogen distribution and drug sensitivity of lacrimal angiitis, and to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospective study. A total of 45 patients (45 eyes) diagnosed with lacrimal angiitis in Hebei Eye Hospital from December 2016 to October 2020 were selected to analyze the general information, clinical manifestations and previous treatment history, bacterial culture results, and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: All 45 patients had monocular disease, including 21 eyes with tears, increased secretion, conjunctival congestion in inner canthus, 14 eyes with red and swollen inner canthus, 6 eyes similar to eyelid cyst, and 4 eyes were found and diagnosed during routine preoperative examination. 27 eyes were previously diagnosed with other eye diseases, and the misdiagnosis rate was 60.0%. The positive rate of bacterial culture was 80.0% (36/45), Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common, followed by Streptococcus; 52.8% (19/36) of the patients were infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The sensitivity rate of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (82.9%, 97/117) was higher than that of aminoglycosides (70.1%, 68/97) and cephalosporins (68.1%, 111/163). Except vancomycin, rifampicin, levofloxacin and chloramphenicol were highly sensitive to Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common pathogen of dacryocystitis, followed by Streptococcus. Levofloxacin and rifampicin can be the first choice antibiotics for local anti-infection. Rational drug use can reduce the formation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The cure rate can be improved by complete removal of stones by incision and plasty of lacrimal canaliculus.","Liu S., Zhou C.-Q., Shi J.-H., Bai P., Song L.-H., Wang H.-X., Yang J.-W.",10.3980/j.issn.1672-5123.2021.11.37,International Eye Science
Influence Of Poly-Β-1-6-N-Acetylglucosamine On Biofilm Formation And Drug Resistance Of Acinetobacter Baumannii,"Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the leading bacteria for nosocomial infections, especially in burn wards and ICUs. The bacteria can easily form biofilm and readily attach to abiotic and biotic surfaces, resulting in persistent biofilm-mediated infections. Being surrounded by self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), the microorganisms in biofilm can acquire protective property against detrimental environment and their tolerance toward antibiotics is increased. Poly-β-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), the common constituent of EPS in Acinetobacter baumannii, acts as the key virulence factor and plays a crucial role in biofilm formation process. This review describes the properties and functions of the PNAG and its influence on biofilm formation and drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii.","Guo H., Xiang J.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2015.01.011,Chinese Journal Of Burns
Clinical And Bronchoscopy Characteristics Of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Pneumonia In Children With 23S Rrna Resistance Gene Positive In Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid,"Objective To investigate clinical and bronchoscopy characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children with 23 S rRNA resistance gene positive in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and find clinical indicators that can identify Mycoplasma pneumoniae drug resistance early. Methods The clinical data of 61 hospitalized children diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia as subjects from October 2017 to June 2018 in the Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine of Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University were analyzed retrospectively. Bronchoscopy was performed on each subject and the BALF was taken and used to detect the 2063 site mutation of the 23S rRNA V region gene in BALF, and they were divided into drug - resistant gene positive group and drug - resistant gene negative group. The clinical manifestations, relevant laboratory data, imaging data, and bronchoscopy findings in different load groups were compared. Statistical methods such as t test, rank sum test, χ(2) test, Fisher's exact probability method, and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Results Among the 61 children, 38 cases (62. 30%) were in the drug resistance gene positive group, and 23 cases (37. 70%) were in the drug resistance gene negative group. There were no significant differences in gender and age between the two groups (all P> 0.05). The days of hospitalization and fever in the children with positive drug resistance genes were longer than those in the negative drug resistance gene groups, and they were more likely to have refractory mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(RMPP) and extra pulmonary complications, with statistically significant differences (P <0. 05), but there were no significant differences in hypoxemia (P > 0. 05). There were significant differences in white blood cell(WBC), C - reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D - Dimer (D - D) and interleukin - 6 (IL - 6) between the two groups (all P <0. 05). Except that the WBC level in the drug - resistant gene - positive group was lower than that in the drug - resistant gene - negative group, the rest of the test results indicated that the drug - resistant gene - positive group was higher than the drug - resistant gene - negative group. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenlase(LDH)and IL -6 in BALF (P >0. 05). In this study, Logistic regression analysis was performed on several statistically significant laboratory indicators. It was found that WBC was more sensitive to identify drug resistance genes, and the optimal critical value was 8. 55 x 10VL. The specificity of D - D in identifying drug resistance genes was higher, and the optimal cut - off value was 523 |xg/L. In the drug resistance gene positive group, 35 cases (92. 11%) showed extensive lung consolidation/atelectasis on imaging, and the drug resistance gene negative group was 13 cases (56. 52%), with statistically significant differences (P < 0. 05). The drug resistance gene - positive group mainly showed mucosal erosion, necrosis, phlegm plug/plastic phlegm plug and bronchitis stenosis, with a total of 19 cases (50. 00%). In the drug resistance gene negative group, the main manifestations of mucosal longitudinal wrinkle, flocculent and viscous secretions were 14 cases (60. 88%), with statistically significant differences (P <0. 05). Conclusions The point mutation of 23S rRNA V region gene is closely related to the clinical characteristics of children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Children with A2063G mutation are more prone to have RMPP and extrapulmonary complications, and their imaging manifestation and bronchoscopy are more severe. The levels of leukocytes and D - D in the blood have significance for the early identification of drug resistance. The systemic excessive immune inflammatory response caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with drug - resistant gene positive needs to be valued.","Jiayi C., Han Z., Yunxiao S.",10.3760/cma.j.cn101070-20210723-00869,Chinese Journal Of Applied Clinical Pediatrics
Controlling Infection And Spread Of Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Among Burn Patients,"The emergence and spread of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn ward is an important threat to burn management. CRKP isolates are resistant to almost all available antibiotics and are susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline. The mechanism of the drug resistance of CRKP is associated with the plasmid-encoded carbapenemase Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), a carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamase. Antibiotics which can currently be used to treat CRKP infection include polymyxins, tigecycline, and some aminoglycosides. The efficacy of using antibiotics in combination is better than that of single-agent therapy for the treatment of CRKP infection in bloodstream. In order to control CRKP infection in burn patients, strategies for preventing CRKP dissemination in burn ward are strongly advocated.",Huan J.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2015.01.002,Chinese Journal Of Burns
Distribution Of Pathogenic Bacteria And Analysis Of Drug Sensitivity In Acute Dacryocystitis,"AIM: To explore the pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance of acute dacryocystitis, and to provide a guide for rational clinical medication. METHODS: Lacrimal sac pus samples from 80 acute dacryocystitis cases were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity test in Hebei Provincial Eye Hospital from January 2014 to October 2019. The change of detection rate of pathogenic bacteria in different years, the species of pathogenic bacteria of acute dacryocystitis, the main pathogenic bacteria, drug sensitivity and drug resistance of acute dacryocystitis, and the average detection rate of pathogenic bacteria in acute dacryocystitis were analyze. RESULTS: Totally 56 samples were positive for pathogenic bacteria, including 55 cases of bacteria and 1 case of fungi. The average detection rate was 70%. The detection rate of pathogenic bacteria strains was gradually decreasing year by year, and there were various types of pathogenic bacteria strains detected from samples. In addition, Gram-positive cocci was the main pathogenic bacteria of acute dacryocystitis, accounting for 68% (38 cases), of which, staphylococcus aureus accounted for 38% (21 cases). What's more, most Gram-positive cocci were sensitive to rifampin, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, and Gram-negative bacilli were more sensitive to tobramycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Fifty-five cases of bacterial samples were obviously resistant to the first and second generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci constitute the main pathogenic bacteria of acute dacryocystitis, and levofloxacin can be used as the first choice of topical antibiotics for the treatment of acute dacryocystitis.","Shi J.-H., Zhou C.-Q., Liu S., Yang J.-W., Xiao L., Bai P.",10.3980/j.issn.1672-5123.2021.2.37,International Eye Science
"Antibiotic Sensitivity And Resistance Patterns Of Common Microbes Among Burn Patients At Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad","Objective: To determine the most frequently occurring microbes in burn infections, along with their antibiotic sensitivity and resistance profile and to revise treatment protocols accordingly. Study Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the Department of Plastic Surgery & Burns, Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad from 1(st) January 2024 to 30(th) June 2024. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study included 97 patients with burn injuries having a Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) greater than 10% and who had not been previously treated. Data were collected using a non-probability consecutive sampling technique after obtaining informed consent. Microbial analysis was performed and data were analyzed. Pearson chi-square test was applied and P value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean age of patients was 33.3 years. Out of 97 patients, majority of cases were seen in females (58.8%). Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa were the most commonly isolated organisms (34% and 30.90%) respectively. Linezolid (68%) and Meropenem (58%) are the most sensitive antibiotics while Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid and Erythromycin carries the highest resistance rate i.e. 93.8% for both. Conclusion: There is a rising concern of multidrug resistant organisms especially Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and MRSA. Several antibiotics like Piperacillin, Tazobactum, and Meropenem are becoming more and more resistant. Some drugs like Linezolid and Vancomycin still have better efficacies but they should be used cautiously.","Khan F., Mahmood A., Iqbal S.",10.60110/medforum.350805,Medical Forum Monthly
Rapid And Accurate Detection Of Carbapenem-Resistance Gene By Isothermal Amplification In Acinetobacter Baumannii,"Background: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is one of the pivotal pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections, especially in patients with low immune response, and infection with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been increasing in recent years. Rapid and accurate detection of carbapenem-resistance genes in A. baumannii could be of immense help to clinical staff. Methods: In this study, a 15-µL reaction system for recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) was developed and tested. We collected 30 clinical isolates of A. baumannii from the Burn Institute of Southwest Hospital of Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University) for 6 months and tested antibiotic susceptibility using the VITEK 2 system. A. baumannii was detected based on the bla(OXA-51) gene by PCR, qPCR and 15 µL-RPA, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. In addition, PCR and 15 µL-RPA data for detecting the carbapenem-resistance gene bla(OXA-23) were comparatively assessed. Results: The detection limit of the bla(OXA-51) gene by 15 µL RPA was 2.86 CFU/ml, with sensitivity comparable to PCR and qPCR. No positive amplification signals were detected in non-Acinetobacter isolates, indicating high specificity. However, only 18 minutes were needed for the 15 µL RPA assay. Furthermore, an antibiotic susceptibility test showed that up to 90% of A. baumannii strains were resistant to meropenem and imipenem; 15 µL RPA data for detecting bla(OXA-23) showed that only 10% (n = 3) of A. baumannii isolates did not show positive amplification signals, and the other 90% of (n = 27) isolates were positive, corroborating PCR results. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the new 15 µL RPA assay for detecting bla(OXA-23) in A. baumannii is faster and simpler than qPCR and PCR. It is a promising alternative molecular diagnostic tool for rapid and effective detection of A. baumannii and drug-resistance genes in the field and point-of-care testing.","Liu S., Huang G., Gong Y., Jin X., Meng Y., Peng Y., Zhao J., Li X., Li Q.",10.1093/BURNST/TKAA026,Burns And Trauma
"Phenotypic And Genomic Analyses Of Burkholderia Stabilis Clinical Contamination, Switzerland","A recent hospital outbreak related to premoistened gloves used to wash patients exposed the difficulties of defining Burkholderia species in clinical settings. The outbreak strain displayed key B. stabilis phenotypes, including the inability to grow at 42°C; we used whole-genome sequencing to confirm the pathogen was B. stabilis. The outbreak strain genome comprises 3 chromosomes and a plasmid, sharing an average nucleotide identity of 98.4% with B. stabilis ATCC27515 BAA-67, but with 13% novel coding sequences. The genome lacks identifiable virulence factors and has no apparent increase in encoded antimicrobial drug resistance, few insertion sequences, and few pseudogenes, suggesting this outbreak was an opportunistic infection by an environmental strain not adapted to human pathogenicity. The diversity among outbreak isolates (22 from patients and 16 from washing gloves) is only 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, although the genome remains plastic, with large elements stochastically lost from outbreak isolates.","Seth-Smith H.M.B., Casanova C., Sommerstein R., Meinel D.M., Abdelbary M.M.H., Blanc D.S., Droz S., Führer U., Lienhard R., Lang C., Dubuis O., Schlegel M., Widmer A., Keller P.M., Marschall J., Egli A.",10.3201/EID2406.172119,Emerging Infectious Diseases
Controlling The Growth Of The Skin Commensal Staphylococcus Epidermidis Using D-Alanine Auxotrophy,"Using live microbes as therapeutic candidates is a strategy that has gained traction across multiple therapeutic areas. In the skin, commensal microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining skin barrier function, homeostasis, and cutaneous immunity. Alterations of the homeostatic skin microbiome are associated with a number of skin diseases. Here, we present the design of an engineered commensal organism, Staphylococcus epidermidis, for use as a live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate for skin diseases. The development of novel bacterial strains whose growth can be controlled without the use of antibiotics or genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance enables modulation of therapeutic exposure and improves safety. We therefore constructed an auxotrophic strain of S. epidermidis that requires exogenously supplied D-alanine. The S. epidermidis NRRL B-4268 Δalr1 Δalr2 Δdat strain (SEΔΔΔ) contains deletions of three biosynthetic genes: two alanine racemase genes, alr1 and alr2 (SE1674 and SE1079), and the D-alanine aminotransferase gene, dat (SE1423). These three deletions restricted growth in D-alanine-deficient medium, pooled human blood, and skin. In the presence of D-alanine, SEΔΔΔ colonized and increased expression of human-defensin 2 in cultured human skin models in vitro. SEΔΔΔ showed a low propensity to revert to D-alanine prototrophy and did not form biofilms on plastic in vitro. These studies support the potential safety and utility of SEΔΔΔ as a live biotherapeutic strain whose growth can be controlled by D-alanine. IMPORTANCE The skin microbiome is rich in opportunities for novel therapeutics for skin diseases, and synthetic biology offers the advantage of providing novel functionality or therapeutic benefit to live biotherapeutic products. The development of novel bacterial strains whose growth can be controlled without the use of antibiotics or genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance enables modulation of therapeutic exposure and improves safety. This study presents the design and in vitro evidence of a skin commensal whose growth can be controlled through D-alanine. The basis of this strain will support future clinical studies of this strain in humans.","Dodds D., Bose J.L., Deng M.-D., Dubé G.R., Grossman T.H., Kaiser A., Kulkarni K., Leger R., Mootien-Boyd S., Munivar A., Oh J., Pestrak M., Rajpura K., Tikhonov A.P., Turecek T., Whitfilla T.",10.1128/MSPHERE.00360-20,Msphere
Communication Is Key: A Multifaceted Approach To Improving Essential Asp Metrics In Surgical Services,"Background: Despite widespread antimicrobial resistance, suboptimal antimicrobial use is common, particularly among surgical services. Studies show that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) effectively improve antimicrobial use and decrease adverse events. However, evidence for optimal ASP intervention in surgical departments is lacking, and some surgical services perceive ASPs negatively. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of several collaborative ASP interventions and workflow changes on the non-acceptance rate (NAR) of ASP recommendations and antimicrobial use among surgical services. Methods: This was a retrospective, pre-post study of services in the department of surgery at a 681-bed, academic medical center between 12/01/2018 and 5/31/2020. Throughout 10/2019 and 11/2019, the core ASP, which consists of two infectious diseases physicians and two infectious diseases pharmacists, performed several interventions with surgical services. These included meetings with the chairman, vice chairs, and division chiefs of the surgery department, a grand rounds presentation to surgical house staff, and monthly surgeon NAR reporting to the chairman. Also, per feedback from surgeons, the ASP began to communicate recommendations directly to attending surgeons instead of residents or via ASP notes in the medical record. Data for the pre-period was collected from 12/2018 to 9/2019; data for the post-period was collected from 12/2019 to 5/2020. Wilcoxson rank sum, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare outcomes. Results: The ASP communicated 353 recommendations to surgical services in the pre-period, and 181 in the post-period. ASP offered most recommendations to trauma (n=244), cardiothoracic (n=60), and plastic surgery (n=54) during the study periods. NAR decreased post-intervention overall (43% vs 29%, p=0.0013) and in trauma surgery (63% vs 47%, p=0.03). Mean monthly days of therapy per 1000 patient days trended towards a decrease post-intervention (1105 vs 1044, p=0.26). Cost per 1000 patient days decreased post-intervention ($27,677.91 vs $19,766.31, p =0.0075). Conclusion: A communicative and adaptive approach to ASP in surgical services improved NAR and antimicrobial costs and trended towards a reduction in antimicrobial use.","Britt R.S., Reynoso D., Keiser P.H., Ferren R.S.",10.1093/ofid/ofaa417.211,Open Forum Infectious Diseases
Surgical Treatment Of Post-Bariatric Gynecomastia,"Background: The development of the pectoralis muscle is related to chest shape and aesthetic standards. Conditions such as abnormal fat disposition, gynecomastia and congenital abnormalities distort the normal anatomy and are common motivating factors for requesting reshaping surgery. Also, correction of poorly developed pectoral muscles is progressively being mentioned by men. This poor development is frequently a result of the modem lifestyle in which daily activities do not require much pectoral strength, a high caloric intake, and an absence of physical exercise. Objective: to restore normal chest contours, eliminate the inframammary fold, correct the nipple areola complex position, remove redundant skin, create symmetry between the two halves of the chest and minimize scarring. Conclusion: To facilitate tissue accommodation and achieve an even chest surface, we advise patients to wear elastic compressive chest garments for a period of 1-2 months.","Ellatef T.E.A., Awad M.S., Nasr M.A., Ibrahim A.A.E.",10.31838/jcdr.2021.12.07.168,Journal Of Cardiovascular Disease Research

An In-Depth Analysis Of The Artery Of Salmon: Anatomy And Neurosurgical Implications,"Background: Michel Salmon was a prominent person in the field of plastic surgery during the early 20th century. His pioneering work contributed significantly to our understanding of human anatomy, particularly with the identification of the artery of Salmon (AOS). The objective of this study is to thoroughly investigate the AOS by conducting a comprehensive literature review, providing insights into its anatomy and surgical implications. Methods: This review was undertaken after a thorough examination of literature encompassing papers about the AOS. Right up until January 2024, databases like PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science were explored. The search was conducted using specific terms such as “Artery of Salmon,” “suboccipital artery,” and “vertebral artery anatomy.” An in-depth assessment was conducted to examine the anatomy, and surgical significance of the AOS. Results: The AOS is a branch of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery that supplies the suboccipital muscles. The ability, to identify it, is critical for distinguishing the origins of intraoperative hemorrhage. Through careful surgical intervention, the artery was able to devascularize tumors and vascular lesions. We also touched on the technical issues of its possible application in bypass operations for aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or vertebral artery. Conclusions: The AOS is sometimes vital in neurosurgery, facilitating precise interventions and serving as a conduit in suboccipital bypass surgeries. Understanding its variations is essential for neurosurgeons, showcasing ongoing advancements in patient care.","Atallah O., Almealawy Y.F., Badary A., Hernández-Hernández A., Andrew Awuah W., Sanker V., Chaurasia B., Umana G.E.",10.1016/j.wneu.2024.03.105,World Neurosurgery
Effect Of Biofilm Formation Of Acinetobacter Baumannii Strains Isolated From Burn Patients On Expressions Of Efflux Pump Regulatory Genes Ades And Ader And Corresponding Functional Gene Cluster Adeab,"Objective: To explore changes of expressions of efflux pump upstream regulatory genes adeS and adeR and corresponding functional gene cluster adeAB of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) isolates under free and biofilm formation conditions and investigate the effect of biofilm formation on the active efflux function and drug resistance. Methods: Nine drug-resistant and nine drug-sensitive AB strains isolated from wound excretion, blood, and venous catheter of burn patients hospitalized in Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from March to September 2013 were collected. The strains were cultured for 24 h by tube method under shaking condition and the relative mRNA expressions of efflux pump gene adeA and adeB and regulatory genes adeS and adeR were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Expressions of adeA, adeB, adeS, and adeR of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains under free condition (free bacteria) were higher than those under biofilm formation condition (biofiim bacteria) (P<0.05). Expressions of adeA and adeB of drug-resistant strains under free and biofilm formation conditions were higher than those of sensitive strains (P<0.05). Conclusion: The active efflux function is a major mechanism of drug resistance of AB under free condition. After biofilm was formed, AB can down-regulate the expression of adeS by sensing the changes of biofilm condition, inactivating the adeR, and decreasing the expression of functional gene adeAB, which makes the biofilm being the leading cause for drug resistance.","Xiang J., Guo H.-N., Huan J.-N.",10.3969/j.issn.1674-8115.2015.09.024,Journal Of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Medical Science)
Drug Resistant Cells With Very Large Proliferative Potential Grow Exponentially In Metastatic Prostate Cancer,"Most metastatic cancers develop drug resistance during treatment and continue to grow, driven by a subpopulation of cancer cells unresponsive to the therapy being administered. There is evidence that metastases are formed by phenotypically plastic cancer cells with stem-cell like properties. Currently the population structure and growth dynamics of the resulting metastatic tumors is unknown. Here, using scaling analysis of clinical data of tumor burden in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, we show that the drug resistant, metastasis-causing cells (MCC) are capable of producing drug resistant, exponentially growing tumors, responsible for tumor growth as a patient receives different treatments.","Blagoev K.B., Iordanov R., Zhou M., Fojo T., Bates S.E.",10.18632/ONCOTARGET.27855,Oncotarget
Drug Resistance And Status Of Infection Of Acinetobacter Baumannii In Burn Intensive Care Unit During 3 Years,"Objective: To analyze the detection, drug resistance, and status of infection of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) in burn ICU during 3 years. Methods: A total of 2010 specimens of wound secretion, blood, venous catheter attachment, sputum, stool and urine were collected from 505 burn patients hospitalized in our burn ICU from January 2011 to December 2013, and bacterial culture was performed. Pathogens were identified by automatic microorganism identifying and drug sensitivity analyzer. Drug resistance of all the obtained AB to 16 antibiotics commonly used in clinic, including cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin, etc., was tested with K-B paper disk diffusion method. Patients with AB infection were ascertained. The WHONET 5.6 software was used to analyze the distribution of pathogens (luring 3 years, the isolation of AB with different sources and the status of drug resistance of AB to 16 antibiotics each year, and the status of patients with AB infection, and their outcome. Results: A total of 961 strains of pathogens were isolated, among which 185 (19.25%) strains were Gram positive cocci, 728 (75.75%) strains were Gram negative bacilli, and 48 (4.99%) strains were fungi. A total of 172 strains of AB were isolated, ranking the second place among all the detected pathogens, with 67 (38.95%) strains from wound secretion, 11 (6.40%) strains from blood, 23 (13.37%) strains from venous catheter attachment, and 71 (41.28%) strains from sputum, no AB strain was isolated from feces or urine. The AB strains were found sensitive to polymyxin and with relatively low drug resistance rate to minocycline, while the drug resistance rates were over 80.0% to the other 14 antibiotics commonly used in clinic in 2013. AB culture of wound secretion was positive in 27 patients. Among them, 7 patients suffered from wound infection, and the wound infection was caused by AB in 1 out of the 7 patients. AB culture of blood was positive in 7 patients. Among them, 3 patients suffered from bloodstream infection, and the infection was due to AB invasion in 1 out of the 3 patients. AB culture of venous catheter attachment was positive in 20 patients. Among them, 8 patients suffered from bloodstream infection, and the infection was due to AB invasion in 1 out of the 8 patients. AB culture of sputum was positive in 35 patients. Among them, 13 patients suffered from ventilatory associated pneumonia, and 2 out of the 13 patients were diagnosed as AB infection. A total of 69 patients were AB culture positive, among them 64 patients were cured, 2 patients were transferred to other hospitals, and 3 patients died, with the mortality rate of 4.35%. Conclusions: AB in our burn ICU has a high detection rate and extensive drug resistance in above-mentioned 3 years. However, AB was mainly colonized in patients with extensive burns with a low mortality rate.","Chen B., Li X., Zhang Z., Zhang X., Deng Z., Zhong X., Tang W., Liu C., Cao W.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2015.01.006,Chinese Journal Of Burns
Erythrocyte Membrane Coating Alleviate Immune Response And Promoted Adipogenesis In Adipose Matrix,"Xenotransplantation of acellular adipose matrix (AAM) has come to prominence as an intriguing option for soft tissue reconstruction. However, the presence of immunogenic antigens within AAM can trigger unfavorable immune reactions, leading to inadequate in vivo regeneration outcomes. Therefore, the development of advanced technology capable of modulating immune responses is crucial for the therapeutic implementation of AAM xenografts. In this work, an innovative technique is created to bypass the immune system by covering the surface of both AAM and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-modified AAM xenografts with autologous red blood cell (RBC) membrane. The RBC membrane coating remained persistent and exhibited no significant decline even after 21 days. Moreover, it effectively reduced the expression of antigen major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC1) on the AAM surface. Following xenogeneic transplantation, the RBC-coated xenografts demonstrated increased expression of the adipogenic factor PPAR-γ, Adipoq, Fabp4, Fasn, and Plin1 and higher numbers of adipocytes. In addition, they exhibited decreased expression of immunological factors, including IL-6, IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, and fewer inflammatory cells. These findings indicate that RBC membrane coating successfully suppressed immune responses and promoted increased adipogenesis in AAM xenografts. Therefore, AAM camouflage coating with RBC has a lot of potential as a biomaterial for soft tissue reconstruction in clinical settings.","Chen K., Guan J., Liu K., You X., Xu M., Lu F., He Y.",10.1089/ten.tea.2023.0354,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Epithelialmesenchymal Plasticity Primes Inherent Resistance To Targeted Therapies,"The metastasis and acquisition of drug resistance in breast cancer cells has been linked to epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Directed therapies using kinase inhibitors and antibodies to target human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) have served as a testament to the potential of moleculartargeted therapies in this breast cancer subtype. However, Her2targeted therapies are plagued by the pitfalls of intrinsic and acquired resistance, particularly in the metastatic setting. To address these questions we conducted longterm treatments of Her2transformed cells with TGFβ. This treatment regime resulted in a robust and plastic EMT phenotype as characterized by their CD44/CD24 profile. Following removal of stimuli, cells that had undergone TGFβinduced EMT enter into a highly heterogeneous state, the importance of which is evidenced by their increased in vivo tumor growth metastatic capability. Importantly, the Lapatinib resistant cell population that arises following TGFβinduced EMT can be readily eliminated via treatment with recently developed covalent inhibitors of fibroblast growth receptor (FGFR). Overall our data demonstrate that the EMT processes induced by physiologic cytokine stimulation are not only critical drivers of metastatic progression but they also are key events in producing secondary tumors that are poised to be inherently resistant to clinically used targeted molecular therapies.","Brown W.S., Wendt M.",10.1158/15387445.TUMMET15B49,Cancer Research
"Α-Mangostin, A Natural Agent, Enhances The Response Of Nras Mutant Melanoma To Retinoic Acid","Background: The identification and use of novel compounds alone or in combination hold promise for the fight against NRAS mutant melanoma. Material/Methods: We screened a kinase-specific inhibitor library through combining it with a-Mangostin in NRAS mutant melanoma cell line, and verified the enhancing effect of a-Mangostin through inhibition of the tumorigenesis pathway. Results: Within the kinase inhibitors, retinoic acid showed a significant synergistic effect with a-Mangostin. a-Mangostin also can reverse the drug resistance of retinoic acid in RARa siRNA-transduced sk-mel-2 cells. Colony assay, TUNEL staining, and the expressions of several apoptosis-related genes revealed that a-Mangostin enhanced the effect of retinoic acid-induced apoptosis. The combination treatment resulted in marked induction of ROS generation and inhibition of the AKT/S6 pathway. Conclusions: These results indicate that the combination of these novel natural agents with retinoid acid may be clinically effective in NRAS mutant melanoma.","Xia Y., Chen J., Gong C., Chen H., Sun J.",10.12659/MSM.898204,Medical Science Monitor
Usp22 Promotes Melanoma And Braf Inhibitor Resistance Via Yap Stabilization,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a conserved tran- scriptional coactivator that plays key roles in controlling organ size, tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Emerging evidence shows that YAP is overexpressed and associated with resis- tance to BRAF inhibitor treatment in melanoma. However, the mechanism accounting for YAP-overexpression in mela- noma is largely unknown. The present study characterized ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) as a deubiquitinase controlling YAP abundance and biological functions in melanoma. Using western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, it was found that the expression of USP22 and YAP was associated in melanoma cell lines and patient samples. Moreover, USP22 interacted with and deubiquitinated YAP to prevent YAP turnover. Depletion of USP22 decreased YAP expression, which in turn suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of USP22 conferred vemurafenib resistance in a YAP-dependent manner. Overall, the present study revealed the important role of the USP22/YAP axis in melanoma and BRAF inhibitor resistance, and provides a rationale to target USP22/YAP for melanoma treatment.","Wei Y., Jiang Z., Lu J.",10.3892/OL.2021.12655,Oncology Letters
Establishment Of A Novel Temozolomide Resistant Subline Of Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells And Comparative Transcriptome Analysis With Parental Cells,"Background/Aim: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal disease with a high rate of chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ). The aim of the study was to establish a TMZ-resistant subline from the GBM-8401 cell line to determine the mechanisms of resistance and identify novel effective therapeutics for TMZresistant GBM. Materials and Methods: Comparative transcriptome analysis of GBM-8401/TMZR cells and the parental line was performed using Ion Torrent sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the GBM-8401/TMZR and GBM-8401 cell lines were analyzed. Results: Transcriptomic profiling of GBM-8401/TMZR cells revealed DEGs involved in the retinoblastoma (RB) signaling, DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, and DNA repair mechanisms. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo cellbased GBM models should be used in further biomedical studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TMZresistant GBM.","Ha H.-A., Yang J.-S., Tsai F.-J., Li C.-W., Cheng Y.-D., Li J., Hour M.-J., Chiu Y.-J.",10.21873/ANTICANRES.15008,Anticancer Research
Dissolved Oxygen Levels Positively Correlate With Alternative Oxidase Expression And The Itaconic Acid Yield In Aspergillus Terreus Fermentation,"A characteristic of filamentous fungal mitochondria is the existence of an alternative respiratory pathway that features the alternative terminal oxidase (AOX). AOX catalyses the direct reduction of oxygen to water by channeling electrons from the ubiquinone pool directly to oxygen, bypassing cytochrome complex III and IV to recycle the reduction equivalents necessary to drive metabolism and growth. Consequently, the ATP yield is significantly reduced compared to oxidative phosphorylation and most of the released energy is lost as heat. On the other hand, the alternative path via AOX allows the fungus to consume the available growth substrate very fast without the byproduction of detrimental reactive oxygen species by the cytochrome oxidase. AOX was demonstrated to play an indirect but indispensible role during industrial (over)production of fungal secondary metabolites (e.g., citric acid, cephalosporin C). Unlike Cytochrome C, AOX is resistant to cyanide and sensitive to salicylhydroxamic acid, but it has a low affinity for oxygen. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus can produce itaconic acid (systematic name: 2-methylidenebutanedioic acid; IA), a natural building block with great protential for the mass fabrication of biodegradable polymers (plastic and coatings) on an industrial scale The process technologies currently used are similar to those applied for industrial citric acid production -another bulk product of so-called overflow metabolism -by the related species Aspergillus niger. Citric acid is an early intermediate of IA synthesis, and for the current study we assumed that the involvement of AOX in IA production would be similar to the one in citric acid production. A. terreus is capable of growing in the presence of 10 mM KCN. Like other fungal cell factories such as A. niger, A. oryzae and Penicillium chrysogenum, the genome of A. terreus specifies two paralog genes, putatively encoding AOX (aodA and aodB). In submerged fermentations mimicking industrial conditions, aodB displayed constitutive but weak expression at each of the time-points tested. In contrast, the aodA expression level positively correlated with increasing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the bioreactor as well as with the final IA yield of the fermentation. We conclude that the high DO levels required for successful (high-yield) IA fermentation on glucose facilitate increased alternative respiration by means of the cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase AodA.","Molnar A.P., Flipphi M., Sandor E., Fekete E., Karaffa L.",10.1556/030.64.2017.0.101,Acta Microbiologica Et Immunologica Hungarica
The Treatment Method And Effect Of Chronic Diabetic Wounds Of Lower Limbs In Elderly Patients With Comorbidities,"Objective To explore the treatment method and clinical effect of chronic diabetic wounds of lower limbs in elderly patients with comorbidities. Methods The clinical data of elderly comorbid patients with chronic diabetic wounds of lower limbs admitted to Chongming Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Medicine &. Health Sciences from December 2019 to November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Multidisciplinary consultation and comprehensive evaluation were conducted for the patient before surgery and the indicators related to the underlying disease were also adjusted to the safe range for surgery. The wound secretions were taken in time for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity test, and the wound was treated with dressing change and other standardized treatments. According to the location, shape, size and depth of the lower limb wound defect, as well as the infection degree, duration of infection, and extent of surrounding skin damage, debridement, vacuum sealing drainage, tension-reduced suture, skin or flap transplantation, limb (toe) amputation and other method were selected for treatment. After surgery, the prevention and control of the comorbidities of the elderly and nursing management were continued, and the wound healing was observed. According to the evaluation criteria of flap swelling at grade 4 (increased from grade I to grade IV), the swelling degree of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot was evaluated in the early stage (3 to 12 weeks) and the later stage (13 to 52 weeks) . At the last followup, according to the evaluation criteria of the ankle joint wound repair, the curative effect was comprehensively evaluated (excellent, good, general, poor), and the satisfaction evaluation (satisfied, general, unsatisfied) was also conducted. Results A total of 85 patients were included, of which 41 were males and 44 were females; the age ranged from 65 to 93 years, with a mean of 71.4 years. Comorbidities of the elderly include hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, renal insufficiency, diabetes, tumor, gout, senile dementia, senile neurasthenia, sleep disorders, malnutrition, epilepsy, urinary incontinence, delirium, depression, etc. The wound duration ranged from 6 months to 15 years. The depth of the wound reached muscle or bone, and the defect area ranged form 3. 5 cmX2. 5 cm to 22. 0 cmX 10. 5 cm. All 85 patients had positive bacterial cultures of wound secretions. Drug sensitivity test results: 72 cases were sensitive, 10 cases were intermediate, and 3 cases were completely resistant. Clinical medication was based on the drug sensitivity test result and the principles of antibiotic use. For the 3 resistant cases, nutrition, support and other treatments to enhance immunity were given, and the local wound was dressed with 0. 45% - 0. 55% iodophor. Among the 85 cases, 65 were treated with vacuum sealing drainage, 10 patients were treated with tension-reduced suture, 19 were treated with full-thickness skin graft, and 21 were treated with local flap transfer, 20 were repaired by perforator pedicle flap, and 15 underwent amputation (toe) . The follow-up period was 6 to 36 months, with an average of 12. 5 months. Wound healed by primary intention in 57 cases; delayed healing in 21 cases, wound healed after dressing change or surgical repair; wound not healed in 7 cases, wound completely healed after amputation (toe) or other surgical treatment. Evaluation of the degree of swelling in the lower leg and dorsum of the foot: 18 cases of grade I, 47 cases of grade H, 15 cases of grade IE, and 5 cases of grade IV in the early stage; 62 cases of grade I, 18 cases of grade II, and 5 cases of grade HI in the later stage. Comprehensive evaluation of the therapeutic effect; 23 cases were excellent, 45 cases were good, 16 cases were general, and 1 case was poor, with an excellent-good rate of 80%. Satisfaction evaluation; 78 cases were satisfied, 7 cases were general, and the satisfaction rate was 91. 8%. Conclusion Generalist clinical thinking and multidisciplinary collaborative model are important strategies for treating chronic diabetic wounds of lower limbs in elderly patients with comorbidities. By controlling infection with antibiotics and dressing changes, and using reconstructive surgery techniques to repair the wound, the wound healing rate can be improved and satisfactory treatment outcomes can be achieved.","Lin J., Zhang T., Lyu Y., Wang Z., Wang Y., Xiong Y., Fu Y.",10.3760/cma.j.cn114453-20230605-00122,Chinese Journal Of Plastic Surgery
