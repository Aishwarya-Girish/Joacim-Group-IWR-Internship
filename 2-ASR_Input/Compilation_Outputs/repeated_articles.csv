Hypoxia-Sensitive Micellar Nanoparticles For Co-Delivery Of Sirna And Chemotherapeutics To Overcome Multi-Drug Resistance In Tumor Cells,"Recently, it has been discovered that the PEG layer on nanoparticle surface can create steric hindrance, preventing efficient cellular uptake of PEGylated nanoparticles. Thus, it would be ideal to have a nanoparticle system that sheds the PEG layer upon reaching the tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia, which is a hallmark of cancerous tumors, can be used as a trigger to shed the PEG layer from the nanoparticle surface. In this study, a hypoxia-sensitive PEG-azobenzene-PEI-DOPE (PAPD) construct, with an azobenzene group as a hypoxia-sensitive moiety, was prepared. The feasibility of co-delivering Doxorubicin (Dox) and anti-P-gp siRNA (siPgp) using the PAPD nanoparticles was evaluated in monolayers of the Adriamycin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780 ADR, and in 3D spheroids of the multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line, MCF7 ADR. Under hypoxic conditions, the PAPD nanoparticles showed up to a 60% increase in cellular uptake by monolayers and a significantly greater tumor penetration in a spheroid model. siPgp, when delivered using PAPD nanoparticles, showed up to a 60% P-gp downregulation under hypoxic conditions. The combination of siPgp and Dox delivered using PAPD nanoparticles led to an 80% cytotoxicity in cell monolayers and 20% cytotoxicity in spheroids under hypoxic conditions. In this research, a novel hypoxia-sensitive nanoparticle system was developed that demonstrated improved delivery of an encapsulated cargo and augmented cytotoxicity on multidrug-resistant cancer cells under hypoxic conditions.","Ujjwal Joshi, Nina Filipczak, Muhammad Muzamil Khan, Sara Aly Attia, Vladimir Torchilin",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119915,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics
Management And Prevention Of Drug Resistant Infections In Burn Patients,"Introduction: Despite modern advances, the primary cause of death after burns remains infection and sepsis. A key factor in determining outcomes is colonization with multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms. Infections secondary to MDR organisms are challenging due to lack of adequate antibiotic treatment, subsequently prolonging hospital stay and increasing risk of adverse outcomes. Areas covered: This review highlights the most frequent organisms colonizing burn wounds as well as the most common MDR bacterial infections. Additionally, we discuss different treatment modalities and MDR infection prevention strategies as their appropriate management would minimize morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a search for articles on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and UpToDate with applied search strategies including a combination of: ""burns, 'thermal injury,' 'infections,' 'sepsis,' 'drug resistance,' and 'antimicrobials.' Expert opinion: Management and prevention of MDR infections in burns is an ongoing challenge. We highlight the importance of preventative over therapeutic strategies, which are easy to implement and cost-effective. Additionally, targeted, limited use of antimicrobials can be beneficial in burn patients. A promising future area of investigation within this field is post-trauma microbiome profiling. Currently, the best treatment strategy for MDR in burn patients is prevention.","Roohi Vinaik, Dalia Barayan, Shahriar Shahrokhi, Marc G Jeschke",10.1080/14787210.2019.1648208,Expert Review Of Anti-Infective Therapy
Fate And Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Facility Vegetable Soil,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) coexist widely in farmland soils, but the fate and abundance of ARGs onMPs is rarely explored. In this study, high-throughput fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine ARGs onMPs in facility vegetable soil. The results indicated that when the particle size of the MPs was larger, the weathering was more serious, or theMPs came from soils with a long vegetable cultivation period, the levels of antibiotics and heavy metals on the MPs were higher. The distribution of the detected ARGs types on distinct MPs showed changes. Compared with weakly weathered MPs, the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes on strongly weathered MPs were decreased by 2.6% and 1.7%, while the detected sul-ARGs and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes were increased by 1.5% and 2.8%. Compared with smaller MPs, the detected MLSB and vancomycin resistance genes on largerMPswere decreased by 2.0% and 1.4%, while the detected fluoroquinolone, quinolone, florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amphenicol (FCA) resistance genes and sul-ARGs were increased by 1.2% and 1.0%. Compared with MPs in soil after three years of vegetable cultivation, the detected FCA resistance genes and sul-ARGs on MPs in soil after ten years of vegetable cultivation were decreased by 1.3% and 1.6%, while the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes were increased by 1.0% and 1.7%. This study suggests that MPs with larger size, stronger weathering or from soil after long-term vegetable cultivation adsorb more antibiotics and heavy metals and cause more mobile genetic elements, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance on the MPs.

Phage-Plasmids Spread Antibiotic Resistance Genes Through Infection And Lysogenic Conversion,"Antibiotic resistance is rapidly spreading via the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in mobile genetic elements. While plasmids are key drivers of this process, few integrative phages encode antibiotic resistance genes. Here, we find that phage-plasmids, elements that are both phages and plasmids, often carry antibiotic resistance genes. We found 60 phage-plasmids with 184 antibiotic resistance genes, providing resistance for broad-spectrum-cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin. These genes are in a few hot spots, seem to have been cotranslocated with transposable elements, and are often in class I integrons, which had not been previously found in phages. We tried to induce six phage-plasmids with resistance genes (including four with resistance integrons) and succeeded in five cases. Other phage-plasmids and integrative prophages were coinduced in these experiments. As a proof of concept, we focused on a P1-like element encoding an extended spectrum beta-lactamase, bla(CTX-M-55). After induction, we confirmed that it is capable of infecting and converting four other E. coli strains. Its reinduction led to the further conversion of a sensitive strain, confirming that it is a fully functional phage. This study shows that phage-plasmids carry a large diversity of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes that they can transfer across bacteria. As plasmids, these elements seem plastic and capable of acquiring genes from other plasmids. As phages, they may provide novel paths of transfer for resistance genes because they can infect bacteria that are distant in time and space from the original host. As a matter of alarm, they may also mediate transfer to other types of phages. IMPORTANCE The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health. Here, we show that a group of temperate bacterial viruses (phages), termed phage-plasmids, commonly encode different and multiple types of resistance genes of high clinical importance, often in integrons. This is unexpected, as phages typically do not carry resistance genes and, hence, do not confer upon their hosts resistance via infection and genome integration. Our experiments with phage-plasmids isolated from clinical settings confirmed that they infect sensitive strains and render them antibiotic resistant. The spread of antibiotic resistance genes by phage-plasmids is worrisome because it dispenses cell-to-cell contact, which is necessary for canonical plasmid transfer (conjugation). Furthermore, their integrons become genetic platforms for the acquisition of novel resistance genes. The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health. Here, we show that a group of temperate bacterial viruses (phages), termed phage-plasmids, commonly encode different and multiple types of resistance genes of high clinical importance, often in integrons.","Pfeifer, E; Bonnin, Ra; Rocha, Epc",10.1128/mbio.01851-22,Mbio
Varying Characteristics And Driving Mechanisms Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Farmland Soil Amended With High-Density Polyethylene Microplastics,"The differential effects of microplastics and phthalates released from microplastics on antibiotic resistance genes in soil remain unknown. This study aims to analyze the varying characteristics and driving mechanisms of antibiotic resistance genes in soils amended with high-density polyethylene microplastics (with and without phthalates) through a 60-day microcosm experiment. The results indicate that the amended high-density polyethylene microplastics (containing phthalates) enhanced the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the soil, a phenomenon that markedly increased with the amendment period. Nevertheless, the addition of high-density polyethylene microplastics (without phthalates) mitigated the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, which was less significant with increasing amendment period. Furthermore, addition of high-density polyethylene microplastics altered the soil properties, especially porosity. The phthalates released from high-density polyethylene microplastics and the changes in the soil properties transformed soil bacterial communities, resulting in increased abundance of bacterial hosts harboring antibiotic resistance genes (Calditrichaeota, Candidate division CPR1, Candidatus Delongbacteria, Candidatus Kapabacteria, Candidatus Spechtbacteria, Candidatus Wildermuthbacteria, and Ignavibacteriae), thereby enhancing the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. These findings suggest that compared to microplastics, the phthalates released from microplastics considerably affect the antibiotic resistance genes in soils, thereby promoting the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural environments.","Lu, Xm; Chen, Yl",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.128196,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastics In The Marine Environment Are Reservoirs For Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes,"Plastics have been accumulated offshore and in the deep oceans at an unprecedented scale. Microbial communities have colonized the plastisphere, which has become a reservoir for both antibiotic and metal resistance genes (ARGs and MRGs). This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence of ARGs and MRGs, and their relationships within the microbial community, using metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database. The abundance of ARGs and MRGs in microbial communities on the plastics were in the ranges 7.07 x 10(-4)-1.21 x 10(-2) and 5.51 x 10(-3)-4.82 x 10(-2) copies per 16S rRNA, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of ARGs and MRGs in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of ARGs and MRGs in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant differences in the abundance or diversity of ARGs and MRGs between macroplastics biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition was the determining factor of the ARG profile but not for MRG. Some ARGs and MRGs had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles.","Yang, Yy; Liu, Gh; Song, Wj; Ye, C; Lin, H; Li, Z; Liu, Wz",10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.061,Environment International
Selection Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Biodegradable And Non-Biodegradable Microplastics,"Growing evidence have demonstrated that microplastics in the marine ecosystem can provide novel substrates for biofilm formation, potentially facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the biofilm on microplastics has not been fully explored. This study used the metagenomic data of biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics staged at a coastal lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico to profile the ARGs and their bacterial hosts. The abundance and Shannon diversity of ARGs on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate (PHA) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have no significant differences. Nevertheless, the abundance of multidrug resistance genes on PET (3.05 copies per 16S rRNA) was statistically higher than that on PHA (2.05). Beta diversity showed that the overall pattern of resistome on PHA was significantly distinct with that on PET. Procrustes analysis suggested a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition. The host-tracking analysis identified that Pseudomonas was always the major host for glycopeptide and multidrug resistance genes in PET and PHA biofilms, whereas the primary host for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) changed to Desulfovibrio on PET. This study provided the first metagenomic insights into the ARGs and their hosts on biodegradable and nonbiodegradable microplastics, suggesting that both two types of plastics harbor ARGs with preferences.","Sun, Yz; Cao, N; Duan, Cx; Wang, Q; Ding, Cf; Wang, J",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124979,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"The Dissemination Of Antibiotics And Their Corresponding Resistance Genes In Treated Effluent-Soil-Crops Continuum, And The Effect Of Barriers","Irrigation with treated effluent is expanding as freshwater sources diminish, but hampered by growing concerns of pharmaceuticals contamination, specifically antibiotics and resistance determinants. To evaluate this concern, freshwater and effluent were applied to an open field that was treated with soil barriers including plastic mulch together with surface and subsurface drip irrigation, cultivating freshly eaten crops (cucumbers or melons) for two consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that the effluent carries antibiotics and resistance determinants to the drip-irrigated soil and crops regardless of the treatment. To test our hypothesis, we monitored for antibiotics abundance (erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracydine, amoxicillin, and ofloxacin) and their corresponding resistance genes (ermB, ermF, sul1, tetW, tetO, bla(TEM) and qnrB), together with class 1 integron (intl1), and bacterial 16S rRNA, in water, soil, and crop samples taken over two years of cultivation. The results showed that an array of antibiotics and their corresponding resistance genes were detected in the effluent but not the freshwater. Yet, there were no significant differences in the distribution or abundance of antibiotics and resistance genes, regardless of the irrigation water quality, or crop type (p > 0.05), but plastic-covered soil irrigated with effluent retained the antibiotics oxytetracydine and ofloxacin (p < 0.05). However, we could not detect significant correlations between the detected antibiotics and the corresponding resistance genes. Overall, our findings disproved our hypothesis suggesting that treated effluent may not carry antibiotics resistance genes to the irrigated soil and crops yet, plastic mulch covered soil retain some antibiotics that may inflict long term contamination.

Is The Application Of Organic Fertilizers Becoming An Undeniable Source Of Microplastics And Resistance Genes In Agricultural Systems?,"The application of organic fertilizers is becoming an undeniable source of microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soils. The complex microbial activity further transfers resistance genes and their host bacteria to agricultural products and throughout the entire food chain. Therefore, the current main focus is on reducing the abundance of microplastics and ARGs in organic fertilizers at the source, as well as managing microplastics and ARGs in soil. The control of microplastic abundance in organic fertilizers is currently only achieved through pre-composting selection and other methods. However, there are still many shortcomings in the research on the distribution characteristics, propagation and diffusion mechanisms, and control technologies of ARGs, and some key scientific issues still need to be urgently addressed. The high-temperature composting of organic waste can effectively reduce the abundance of ARGs in organic fertilizers to a certain extent. However, it is also important to consider the spread of ARGs in residual antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). This article systematically explores the pathways and interactions of microplastics and resistance genes entering agricultural soils through the application of organic fertilizers. The removal of microplastics and ARGs from organic fertilizers was discussed in detail. Based on the limitations of existing research, further investigation in this area is expected to provide valuable insights for the development and practical implementation of technologies aimed at reducing soil microplastics and resistance genes.","Li, Th; Tao, Sy; Ma, Mj; Liu, Sw; Shen, Mc; Zhang, Hj",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169571,Science Of The Total Environment
Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms On Plastic Wastes In An Estuarine Environment,"Plastic wastes are ubiquitous in aquatic environment. Biofilms, which are often formed on the surface of plastic waste, may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs) and their associated microbial communities in biofilms formed on different types of plastic, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples taken from the Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) with visible biofilms were highly abundant, and the average absolute abundance of most tested ARGs in the biofilms was higher than that in the sediment and water, indicating that biofilms on plastics can act as a reservoir for ARGs. Moreover, the biofilms on PE had a higher relative abundance of ARGs, compared to those on other plastics, and Firmicutes on PE may be potential hosts for these ARGs. Furthermore, Bacillus, Mycobacterium and Aseudomonas may be multi resistance genera on plastics, and IeIA and tetW may have more potential hosts on PET and PP. Metals, total phosphorus and salinity may be the major environmental factors regulating ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics. The results provide new insights into evaluating the risks caused by plastic wastes and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics in estuarine environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Tracking Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic-Contaminated Soil,"Agricultural soils and microplastics (MPs) are hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Plastic mulch is the most important source of MPs in agricultural soil. ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and their host profiles in long-term mulch MP-exposed soils remain unclear. In the present study, metagenomics was used to investigate the distribution patterns of ARGs and MGEs in eight Chinese provinces with a long history of plastic mulch use. A total of 204 subtypes of ARGs and thousands of MGEs (14 integrons, 28 insertions, and 2993 plasmids) were identified. A similar diversity of ARGs was found among MPs film-contaminated sites. The types of ARGs with a high abundance were more concentrated, and multidrug resistance genes were the dominant ARGs. Soils from regions with a longer history of plastic film use (such as Xinjiang province) had a higher abundance of ARGs and MGEs. The distribution of ARGs and MGEs exhibited a modular network distribution pattern. A total of 27 ARG subtypes and 29 MGEs showed co-occurrence network relationships. More than 10 common hosts of ARGs and MGEs, such as Pseudomonas, were found, and their abundances were highest in three provinces, including Xinjiang. This study may help elucidate the impact mechanism of long-term MP residues on the occurrence and spread of ARGs in soil.","Wu, Cc; Song, Xp; Wang, D; Ma, Yj; Ren, Xl; Hu, Hy; Shan, Yp; Ma, Xy; Cui, Jj; Ma, Y",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137235,Chemosphere
Bioplastic Accumulates Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes In Coastal Marine Sediments,"The oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic debris, and several studies have implicated plastic as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bioplastic is widely regarded as an environmentally friendly replacement to conventional petroleum-based plastic, but the effects of bioplastic pollution on marine environments remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first evidence that bioplastic accumulates antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in marine sediments. Biofilms fouling ceramic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) were investigated by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Four ARG groups were more abundant in PHA: trimethoprim resistance (TMP), multidrug resistance (MDR), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance (MLS), and polymyxin resistance (PMR). One MRG group was more abundant in PHA: multimetal resistance (MMR). The relative abundance of ARGs and MRGs were strongly correlated based on a Mantel test between the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices (R = 0.97, p < 0.05) and a Pearson's analysis (R = 0.96, p < 0.05). ARGs were detected in more than 40% of the 57 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) while MRGs were detected in more than 90% of the MAGs. Further investigation (e.g., culturing, genome sequencing, antibiotic susceptibility testing) revealed that PHA biofilms were colonized by hemolytic Bacillus cereus group bacteria that were resistant to beta-lactams, vancomycin, and bacitracin. Taken together, our findings indicate that bioplastic, like conventional petroleum-based plastic, is a reservoir for resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in coastal marine sediments.","Di Cesare, A; Pinnell, Lj; Brambilla, D; Elli, G; Sabatino, R; Sathicq, Mb; Corno, G; O'Donnell, C; Turner, Jw",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118161,Environmental Pollution
Effects Of Triclosan Adsorption On Intestinal Toxicity And Resistance Gene Expression In Xenopus Tropicalis With Different Particle Sizes Of Polystyrene,"Microplastics (MPs) are commonly found with hydrophobic contaminants in the water column and pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. The effects of polystyrene microplastics of different particle sizes on the accumulation of triclosan in the gut of Xenopus tropicalis, its toxic effects, and the transmission of resistance genes were evaluated. The results showed that co-exposure to polystyrene (PS-MPs) adsorbed with triclosan (TCS) caused the accumulation of triclosan in the intestine with the following accumulation capacity: TCS + 5 mu m PS group > TCS group > TCS + 20 mu m PS group > TCS + 0.1 mu m PS group. All experimental groups showed increased intestinal inflammation and antioxidant enzyme activity after 28 days of exposure to PS-MPs and TCS of different particle sizes. The TCS + 20 mu m PS group exhibited the highest upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1 beta). The TCS + 20 mu m group showed the highest increase in enzyme activity compared to the control group. PS-MPs and TCS, either alone or together, altered the composition of the intestinal microbial community. In addition, the presence of more antibiotic resistance genes than triclosan resistance genes significantly increased the expression of tetracycline resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes, which may be associated with the development of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. This study refines the aquatic ecotoxicity assessment of TCS adsorbed by MPs and provides informative information for the management and control of microplastics and non-antibiotic bacterial inhibitors.

Contribution Of Microplastic Particles To The Spread Of Resistances And Pathogenic Bacteria In Treated Wastewaters,"Microplastic Particles (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants widely found in aquatic ecosystems. Although MPs are mostly retained in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a high number of MPs reaches the open waters potentially contributing to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. Nowadays, a limited number of studies have focused on the role of MPs as carriers of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria in WWTPs. Thus, an investigation on the community composition (by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and the abundance of antibiotic and metal resistance genes (by qPCR) of the biofilm on MPs (the plastisphere) and of planktonic bacteria in treated (pre- and post-disinfection) wastewaters was performed. MPs resulted to be very similar in terms of type, color, size, and chemical composition, before and after the disinfection. The bacterial community on MPs differed from the planktonic community in terms of richness, composition, and structure of the community network. Potentially pathogenic bacteria generally showed higher abundances in treated wastewater than in the biofilm on MPs. Furthermore, among the tested resistance genes, only sul2 (a common resistance gene against sulfonamides) resulted to be more abundant in the plastisphere than in the planktonic bacterial community. Our results suggest that the wastewater plastisphere could promote the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic environment although with a relatively lower contribution than the wastewater planktonic bacterial community.","Galafassi, S; Sabatino, R; Sathicq, Mb; Eckert, Em; Fontaneto, D; Dalla Fontana, G; Mossotti, R; Corno, G; Volta, P; Di Cesare, A",10.1016/j.watres.2021.117368,Water Research
Nano- And Microplastics Drive The Dynamic Equilibrium Of Amoeba-Associated Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"As emerging pollutants, microplastics have become pervasive on a global scale, inflicting significant harm upon ecosystems. However, the impact of these microplastics on the symbiotic relationship between protists and bacteria remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which nano- and microplastics of varying sizes and concentrations influence the amoeba-bacterial symbiotic system. The findings reveal that nano- and microplastics exert deleterious effects on the adaptability of the amoeba host, with the magnitude of these effects contingent upon particle size and concentration. Furthermore, nano- and microplastics disrupt the initial equilibrium in the symbiotic relationship between amoeba and bacteria, with nano-plastics demonstrating a reduced ability to colonize symbiotic bacteria within the amoeba host when compared to their microplastic counterparts. Moreover, nano- and microplastics enhance the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and heavy metal resistance genes in the bacteria residing within the amoeba host, which undoubtedly increases the potential transmission risk of both human pathogens and resistance genes within the environment. In sum, the results presented herein provide a novel perspective and theoretical foundation for the study of interactions between microplastics and microbial symbiotic systems, along with the establishment of risk assessment systems for ecological environments and human health.","Zhou, M; Ma, L; Wang, Zh; Li, Sc; Cai, Yj; Li, Mc; Zhang, L; Wang, C; Wu, B; Yan, Qy; He, Zl; Shu, Lf",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134958,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Potential Environmental Risks Of Field Bio/Non-Degradable Microplastic From Mulching Residues In Farmland: Evidence From Metagenomic Analysis Of Plastisphere,"The plastisphere may act as reservoir of antibiotic resistome, accelerating global antimicrobial resistance dissemination. However, the environmental risks in the plastisphere of field microplastics (MPs) in farmland remain largely unknown. Here, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) on polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate and polylactic acid microplastics (PBAT/PLAMPs) from residues were investigated using metagenomic analysis. The results suggested that the profiles of ARG and VF in the plastisphere of PBAT/PLA-MPs had greater number of detected genes with statistically higher values of diversity and abundance than soil and PE-MP. Procrustes analysis indicated a good fitting correlation between ARG/VF profiles and bacterial community composition. Actinobacteria was the major host for tetracycline and glycopeptide resistance genes in the soil and PE-MP plastisphere, whereas the primary host for multidrug resistance genes changed to Proteobacteria in PBAT/PLA-MP plastisphere. Besides, three human pathogens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in the plastisphere. The PE -MP plastisphere exhibited a higher transfer potential of ARGs than PBAT/PLA-MP plastisphere. This work enhances our knowledge of potential environmental risks posed by microplastic in farmland and provides valuable insights for risk assessment and management of agricultural mulching applications.","Li, K; Xu, Lb; Bai, Xy; Zhang, Gb; Zhang, Mj; Huang, Y",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133428,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Isolation And Identification Of Aerobic Bacteria Carrying Tetracycline And Sulfonamide Resistance Genes Obtained From A Meat Processing Plant,"Microbial contamination in food-processing plants can play a fundamental role in food quality and safety. The purpose of this study was to investigate aerobic bacteria carrying tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes from a meat processing plant as possible sources of meat contamination. One hundred swab samples from surfaces of conveyor belts, meat slicers, meat knives, benches, plastic trays, gloves, and aprons were analyzed. A total of 168 isolates belonging to 10 genera were obtained, including Pseudomonas sp. (n = 35), Acinetobacter sp. (n = 30), Aeromonas sp. (n = 20), Myroides sp. (n = 15), Serratia sp.

Of the 168 isolates investigated, 60.7% showed resistance to tetracycline and 57.7% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The tetracycline resistance genes tetL, tetA, tetB, tetC, tetE, tetM, tetS, tetK, and tetX were found in the frequency of 7.7%, 6.0%, 4.8%, 4.8%, 3.6%, 3.6%, 3.6%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were observed in the frequency of 17.9% and 38.1%, respectively. The tetracycline resistance genes tetX was first found in Myroides sp.

Distinct Bacterial Communities And Resistance Genes Enriched By Triclocarban-Contaminated Polyethylene Microplastics In Antibiotics And Heavy Metals Polluted Sewage Environment,"Knowledge gaps still surround the question of what biofilms form on contaminated microplastics (MPs) in the antibiotics and (or) heavy metals polluted sewage. In this work, the clean polyethylene microplastics (PE MPs) and triclocarban (TCC)-contaminated PE MPs were cultured in the sewage containing only ampicillin (AMP), only copper (Cu) and both AMP and Cu for 28 days. The results showed that the TCC on PE MPs (with concentration of 2.48 mg/g PE MPs) did not impede the adhesion of the bacteria and the formation of biofilm. Moreover, many potential pathogenic bacteria (Aquabacterium and Pseudoxanthomonas) and potential resistant bacteria (Stenotrophomonas) were more likely to attach on TCC-contaminated PE MPs compared with clean PE MPs. In addition, biofilms of TCCcontaminated PE MPs had highest potential pathogenic functions. TCC-contaminated PE MPs also caused the increases of various resistance genes in both biofilm and sewage. The co-occurrence of TCC, AMP and Cu might exert a stronger selective pressure on bacterial communities and promote the co-selection of resistance genes. In addition, TCCcontaminated PE MPs resulted in higher abundance of five mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (intI1, intI3, tnpA-04, IS613 and trb-C) in sewage, which might further promote the transmission of resistance genes.","Zhao, Yf; Gao, Jf; Wang, Zq; Cui, Yc; Zhang, Y; Dai, Hh; Li, Dc",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156330,Science Of The Total Environment
Can Microplastics And Disinfectant Resistance Genes Pose Conceivable Threats To Water Disinfection Process?,"Microplastic pollution in the environment has aroused widespread concerns, however, the potential environmental risks caused by excessive use of disinfectants are still unknown. Disinfectants with doses below the threshold can enhance the communication of resistance genes in pathogenic microorganisms, promoting the development and spread of antimicrobial activity. Problematically, the intensification of microplastic pollution and the increase of disinfectant consumption will become a key driving force for the growth of disinfectant resistance bacteria (DRB) and disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs) in the environment. Disinfection plays a crucial role in ensuring water safety, however, the presence of microplastics and DRGs seriously disturb the water disinfection process. Microplastics can reduce the concentration of disinfectant in the local environment around microorganisms and improve their tolerance. Microorganisms can improve their resistance to disinfectants or generate resistance genes via phenotypic adaptation, gene mutations, and horizontal gene transfer. However, very limited information is available on the impact of DRB and DRGs on disinfection process. In this paper, the contribution of microplastics to the migration and transmission of DRGs was analyzed. The challenges posed by the presence of microplastics and DRGs on conventional disinfection were thoroughly discussed. The knowledge gaps faced by relevant current research and further research priorities have been proposed in order to provide a scientific basis in the future.","Shen, Mc; Zhao, Yf; Liu, Sw; Tao, Sy; Li, Th; Long, Hm",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167192,Science Of The Total Environment
(Micro) Nanoplastics Promote The Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Gene Propagation In Biological Phosphorus Removal System,"Microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as emerging pollutants, have been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants. However, the behavior of phosphorus and ARGs under MP and NP (MP/NP) pressure in biological phosphorus removal (BPR) system is still unknown. This study investigated the effects of MP/NPs on phosphorus removal and ARGs propagation in BPR system. Results showed that MP/NPs had no influence on phosphorus removal, but significantly promoted the amplification of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs). Moreover, the TRG abundance were more facilitated by MPs than NPs, and the TRGs of efflux pump and enzymatic modification mechanism were mainly enriched. Meanwhile, MP/NPs increased the transmission risk of multiple resistance genes and mobile gene elements (MGEs). Microbial communities demonstrated the main polyphosphate accumulating organisms shifted from Acinetobacter to unclassified_Gammaproteobacteria, which explained why phosphorus removal efficiency was unaffected with MP/NP addition. Correlation analysis revealed there was no significant correlation between ARGs and MGEs (intI1 and intI2), but the abundances of potential hosts of ARGs were significantly increased with MP/NP addition, implying microbial community structure changes rather than gene horizontal transfer was the main factor promoting ARG propagation under MP/NP pressure.","Zhou, Cs; Wu, Jw; Liu, Bf; Ma, Wl; Yang, Ss; Cao, Gl",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128547,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Response Of Sedimentary Microbial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes To Aged Micro(Nano)Plastics Exposure Under High Hydrostatic Pressure,"Several studies reported that the presence of microplastics (MPs)/nanoplastics (NPs) in marine environments can alter microbial community and function. Yet, the impact of aged MPs/NPs on deep sea sedimentary ecosystems under high hydrostatic pressure remains insufficiently explored. Herein, the sedimentary microbial community composition, co-occurrence network, assembly, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in response to aged MPs/NPs were investigated. Compared with the control, NPs addition significantly reduced bacterial alpha diversity (p < 0.05), whereas MPs showed no significant impact (p > 0.05). Moreover, networks under NPs exhibited decreased complexity than that under MPs and the control, including edges, average degree, and the number of keystone. The assembly of the microbial community was primarily governed by stochastic processes, and aged MPs/NPs increased the importance of stochastic processes. Moreover, exposure to MPs/NPs for one month decreased the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (from 94.8 to 36.2 TPM), while exposure for four months increased the abundance (from 40.6 to 88.1 TPM), and the shift of ARGs in sediment was driven by both functional modules and microbial community. This study is crucial for understanding the stress imposed by aged MPs/NPs on sedimentary ecosystems under high hydrostatic pressure.","Chen, Cl; Lai, Hf; Deng, Ya; Cao, J; Chen, Jw; Jin, Sd; Wu, Wm; Sun, D; Zhang, Cf",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135942,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Distinct Species Turnover Patterns Shaped The Richness Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Eight Different Microplastic Polymers,"Elucidating the formation mechanism of plastisphere antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on different polymers is necessary to understand the ecological risks of plastisphere ARGs. Here, we explored the turnover and assembly mechanism of plastisphere ARGs on 8 different microplastic polymers (4 biodegradable (bMPs) and 4 nonbiodegradable microplastics (nMPs)) by metagenomic sequencing. Our study revealed the presence of 479 ARGs with abundance ranging from 41.37 to 58.17 copies/16S rRNA gene in all plastispheres. These ARGs were predominantly multidrug resistance genes. The richness of plastisphere ARGs on different polymers had a significant correlation with the contribution of species turnover to plastisphere ARGs beta diversity. Furthermore, polymer type was the most critical factor affecting the composition of plastisphere ARGs. More opportunistic pathogens carrying diverse ARGs on BMPs (PBAT, PBS, and PHA) with higher horizontal gene transfer potential may further magnify the ecological risks and human health threats. For example, the opportunistic pathogens Riemerella anatipestifer, Vibrio campbellii, and Vibrio cholerae are closely related to human production and life, which were the important potential hosts of many plastisphere ARGs and mobile genetic elements on BMPs. Thus, we emphasize the urgency of developing the formation mechanism of plastisphere ARGs and the necessity of controlling BMPs and ARG pollution, especially BMPs, with ever-increasing usage in daily life.","Zhang, Wh; Geng, J; Sun, Mg; Jiang, Cx; Lin, H; Chen, Hy; Yang, Yy",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119562,Environmental Research
Do Microplastic Biofilms Promote The Evolution And Co-Selection Of Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes And Their Associations With Bacterial Communities Under Antibiotic And Metal Pressures?,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms with heterogeneous bacterial compositions and structure have become a hotspot of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. The evolutionary features of ARGs and their related factors including class 1 integron (intI1), metal resistance genes (MRGs), and bacterial communities in MP biofilms under exogenous pressures and how they compared with natural substrates (NS) are unclear. The individual and combined pressures of sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and zinc were used to drive the dynamic evolution of ARGs, intI1, MRGs, and bacterial communities in the MP and NS biofilms. The exogenous pressures from the combined selection of sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and zinc and their increasing concentrations both significantly enhanced the abundances of ARGs on the MP compared to the NS. Meanwhile, the selective pressures resulted in obvious dissimilarities between the MP and NS bacterial communities. The core bacterial taxa and the co-occurrence patterns of ARGs and bacterial genera in the biofilms of MP and NS were obviously different, and more potential ARG host bacteria selectively colonized the MP. Metal pressure also enhanced the enrichment of ARGs in the MP biofilms by promoting the spread of intI1 via the co-selection mechanism.","Liu, Xw; Wang, Hx; Li, Ll; Deng, Cx; Chen, Yh; Ding, Ht; Yu, Zm",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127285,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Metagenomic Analysis Explores The Interaction Of Aged Microplastics And Roxithromycin On Gut Microbiota And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Of Carassius Auratus,"The aging process changes the physicochemical structure of microplastics and affects environmental behaviors and toxicological effects of coexisting pollutants, thereby posing ecological risks. In this study, the effects of aged polystyrene microplastics alone or in combination with the 100 mu g/L roxithromycin (ROX) on intestines of Carassius auratus were investigated. The carrier effect of microplastics was enhanced by aging due to changes in functional groups and surface area, which led to an increase in the bioaccumulation of ROX. The combined exposure of aged microplastics (APS) and ROX caused more inflammatory cell infiltration and cilia defects, and significantly inhibited the activity of amylase and lipase. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the combined exposure of microplastics and ROX increased the abundance of Gemmobacter, Bosea, Rhizobium, and Shinella and decreased the abundance of Cetobacterium and Akkermansia (p < 0.05). The presence of APS enhanced the selective enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes. What's more, the influence of microplastics and antibiotics on gut microbiota was closely related to carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism activities, as well as the abundance of baca and sul1 resistance genes. These results expand our understanding of the interaction mechanism between APS and antibiotics in real aquatic environment.","Zhang, P; Lu, Gh; Sun, Y; Yan, Zh; Dang, Tj; Liu, Jc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127773,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Distribution And Major Driving Elements Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Soil-Vegetable System Under Microplastic Stress,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are both enriched in soil-vegetable systems as a consequence of the prolonged use of agricultural mulches. MPs can form unique bacterial communities and provide potential hosts for ARGs. Therefore, MPs stress may promote the spread of ARGs from soil to crops. Increasing ARGs pollution in soil-vegetable system. In our research, we investigated the distribution and major driving elements of antibiotic resistance genes in the soil-vegetable system under microplastic stress. The results showed that MPs treatment decreased the relative abundance of ARGs in non-rhizosphere soil. High concentrations of MPs promoted the enrichment of tetracycline antibiotic resistance genes in rhizosphere soil. MPs treatment promoted the enrichment of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in lettuce tissues, and the overall abundance of ARGs in root after 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % (w/w, dry weight) polyethylene (PE) administration was considerably higher compared to that in the untreated group (p < 0.05). At the same time, high PE concentrations promoted the spread of sulfa ARGs from root to leaf. MPs also impacted the bacterial communities in the soil-plant system, and the changes in ARGs as well as MGEs in each part of the soil-vegetable system were significantly correlated with the bacterial diversity index (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis and network analysis showed that bacterial communities and MGEs were the main drivers of ARGs variation in soil-lettuce systems.","Li, N; Zheng, N; Pan, Jm; An, Qr; Li, Xq; Sun, Sy; Chen, Cc; Zhu, Hc; Li, Zm; Ji, Yn",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167619,Science Of The Total Environment
Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics In The Aquatic Environment Enrich Potential Pathogenic Bacteria And Spread Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Fish Gut,"Microplastics and antibiotics coexist in aquatic environments, especially in freshwater aquaculture areas. However, as the second largest production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the world, the effects of co -exposure to microplastics particles and antibiotics on changes in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles and the microbial community structure of aquatic organism gut microorganisms are poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to single or combined PVC microplastic contamination and oxytetracycline (OTC) or sulfamethazine (SMZ) for 8 weeks. PVC microplastics can enrich potential pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter and Acinetobacter, among intestinal microorganisms. The presence of PVC microplastics enhanced the selective enrichment and dissemination risk of ARGs. PVC microplastics combined with OTC (OPVC) treatment significantly increased the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes (1.40 -fold) compared with that in the OTC exposure treatment, revealing an obvious co -selection effect. However, compared with those in the control group, the total abundance of ARGs and MGEs in the OPVC treatment groups were significantly lower, which was correlated with the reduced abundances of the potential host Enterobacter. Overall, our results emphasized the diffusion and spread of ARGs are more influenced by PVC microplastics than by antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic resistance in aquaculture.","Li, W; Zeng, Jy; Zheng, Ng; Ge, Cr; Li, Yy; Yao, Hy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134817,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics Disseminate Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Chinese Soil: A Metagenomic Analysis,"The widespread prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment poses concerns as they are vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The relationships between antibiotic resistomes and MPs remain unexplored in soil which was considered as the reservoirs of MPs and ARGs. This study investigated the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs on soil bacterial communities and ARG abundance which soil samples sourced from 20 provinces across China. We found that PVC significantly influences soil bacterial community structure and ARG abundance. Structural equation modeling revealed that PVC alters soil characteristics, ultimately affecting soil bacterial communities, including ARG-containing bacterial hosts, and the relative abundance of ARGs. This study enhances our understanding of how MPs influence the proliferation and hosts of ARGs within diverse soil environments, offering crucial insights for future strategies in plastic management and disposal.","Zhao, Sw; Zhang, Qr; Huang, Ql; Zhang, Cc; Li, Hn; Siddique, Khm",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135727,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Impacts Of Microplastic Type On The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Horizontal Gene Transfer Mechanism During Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are important pollutants in waste activated sludge (WAS), but their interactions during anaerobic digestion (AD) still need to be further explored. This study investigated variations in ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and host bacteria during AD under the pressure of polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). The results showed that the MPs increased methane production by 11.7-35.5%, and decreased ARG abundance by 5.6-24.6%. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease of MGEs (plasmid, prophage, etc.) promoted the decrease of the abundance of multidrug, aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes. Metagenomic annotation revealed that the reduction of key host bacteria (Arenimonas, Lautropia, etc.) reduced the abundance of major ARGs (rsmA, rpoB2, etc.). Moreover, PP MPs contributed to a reduction in the abundance of functional genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species, ATP synthesis, and cell membrane permeability, which was conducive to reducing the potential for horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. These findings provide insights into the treatment of organic waste containing MPs.","Xu, M; Gao, P; Gao, Y; Xiong, Sj; Chen, Hq; Shen, Xx",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121090,Journal Of Environmental Management
Effects Of Long-Term Microplastic Pollution On Soil Heavy Metals And Metal Resistance Genes: Distribution Patterns And Synergistic Effects,"Heavy metals (HMs) and microplastics (MPs) are two emerging factors threatening global food security. Whether long-term MPs pollution will affect the distribution of HMs and their resistance genes (MRGs) in soil is unknown. Here, metagenomic approach was used to decipher the fate of MRGs in cropland soils with long-term film MPs residues. Similar distribution pattern of MRGs was formed in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. A total of 202 MRG subtypes were detected, with resistance genes for Multimetal, Cu, and As being the most prevalent type of MRGs. MRGs formed a modular distribution of five clusters centered on MRGs including ruvB in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. MRGs also formed tight co-occurrence networks with mobile genetic elements (MGEs: integrons, insertions and plasmids). Redundancy analysis showed that HMs together with microbial communities and MGEs affected the distribution of MRGs in soil. Thirteen genera including Pseudomonas were identified as potential hosts for MRGs and MGEs. The research provides preliminary progress on the synergistic effect of HMs and MPs in affecting soil ecological security. The synergistic effect of MPs and HMs needs to be considered in the remediation of contaminated soils.","Wu, Cc; Song, Xp; Wang, D; Ma, Yj; Ren, Xl; Hu, Hy; Shan, Yp; Ma, Xy; Cui, Jj; Ma, Y",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115180,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Effect Of Microplastics Concentration And Size On Pollutants Removal And Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args) Generation In Constructed Wetlands: A Metagenomics Insight,"The accrual of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics poses synergistic threats to the environment. This study systemically examined the effect of environmental-level (mu g/L) MPs (90-110 mu m) and nanoplastics (NPs, 700 nm) on constructed wetlands (CWs) treating oxytetracycline-contaminated wastewater via metagenomics analysis. Polystyrene (PS) MPs notably hindered the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxytetracycline, particularly at high level (1000 mu g/L), with removal rates of 73.34 %, 59.59 %, and 99.34 %, respectively. Among them, the removal of NH4+-N decreased the most in comparison to CK, at 15.26 %. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) copies/16S rRNA ranged from 0.26 to 0.42 in CWs, exceeding that found in rivers by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 times. The relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes (mdtB, acrB, mexF, mdtC, and mexT) and tetracycline resistance genes (txtA, tetG, and tetP) exhibited a pronounced increase under MPs exposure, ranging from 0.06 to 0.14 and 0.01 to 0.08 copies/16S rRNA, respectively. Redundancy and network analyses emphasized robust associations among contaminant reduction, ARG abundance, and microbial community. Partial least squares path modeling indicated MPs exerted a more profound influence on pollutant removal (coefficient = 0.8194), microbial community (coefficient = 0.3358) and ARGs dissemination (coefficient = 0.6566) compared to NPs. MPs concentrations significantly affects pollutants removal and ARGs proliferation, and MPs with larger sizes amplified ARG dissemination. This research highlights the influence of MPs on CW-mediated wastewater treatment and ARGs accumulation, offering valuable insights for developing ecological wastewater treatment strategies tailored to multi-pollutant scenarios. These insights are fundamental in developing sustainable solutions to the adverse impacts of MPs on ecosystems.","Liang, L; Pan, Wl; Mu, Mr; Zhang, L; Yang, Xy; Zhang, Rn; Du, Lf; Guo, X",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136555,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
The Stress Response Of Tetracycline Resistance Genes And Bacterial Communities Under The Existence Of Microplastics In Typical Leachate Biological Treatment System,"Landfill leachate is an important source of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). Here, in the presence of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) and polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs), the nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect and sludge structure performance were affected in an anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic system, a typical biological leachate treatment process. The abundance of tetracycline-resistance genes (tet genes) in biofilms on the two types of MP was significantly higher than that in the leachate and sludge, and the load on PE-MPs was higher than that on PS-MPs because of the porous structure of PE-MPs. Aging of the MPs increased their surface roughness and abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and shaped the profile of ARGs in the MP biofilms. The biofilm biomass and growth rate on the two types of MP increased with the incubation time in the first 30 days, and was affected by environmental factors. Structural equation models and co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that the MPs indirectly affected the spectrum of ARGs by affecting biofilm formation, and, to a lesser extent, had a direct impact on the selective enrichment of ARGs. We discuss the mechanisms of the relationships between MPs and ARGs in the leachate treatment system, which will have guiding significance for future research. Our data on the colonization of microorganisms and tet genes in MPs biofilms provide new evidence concerning the accumulation and transmission of these ARGs, and are important for understanding the mechanisms of MPs in spreading pollution.","Li, H; Lian, Yt; Li, Sy; Yang, Md; Xie, Qn; Qiu, Lb; Liu, Hy; Long, Yy; Hu, Lf; Fang, Cr",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121865,Journal Of Environmental Management
Microplastics As Carriers Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens In Municipal Solid Waste (Msw) Landfill Leachate And Soil: A Review,"Landfill leachate contains antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs), making it an important reservoir. However, little research has been conducted on how ARGs are enriched on MPs and how the presence of MPs affects pathogens and ARGs in leachates and soil. MPs possess the capacity to establish unique bacterial populations and assimilate contaminants from their immediate surroundings, generating a potential environment conducive to the growth of disease-causing microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), thereby exerting selection pressure. Through a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature, we have carried out a practical assessment of this topic. The gathering of pollutants and the formation of dense bacterial communities on microplastics create advantageous circumstances for an increased frequency of ARG transfer and evolution. Additional investigations are necessary to acquire a more profound comprehension of how pathogens and ARGs are enriched, transported, and transferred on microplastics. This research is essential for evaluating the health risks associated with human exposure to these pollutants.","Jaafarzadeh, N; Talepour, N",10.1007/s40201-023-00879-6,Journal Of Environmental Health Science And Engineering
Effects Of Soil Solarization Combined With Manure-Amended On Soil Args And Microbial Communities During Summer Fallow,"Soil solarization (SS) is a technique for managing pathogens and weeds, which involves covering with transparent plastic to increase soil temperature during summer fallow (SF). However, SS also alters the diversity of bacterial communities. Therefore, during SF, various organic modifiers are used in combination with SS to improve its efficacy. Organic amendments may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) soils are vital to ensure food security and ecological balance. However, comprehensive study on the effects of SS combined with different types of manure on ARGs in GVP soils during SF remains unclear. Therefore, this study employed high-throughput qPCR to explore the effects of different organic amendments combined with SS on the abundance changes of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in GVP soils during SF. The abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs in GVP soils with different manure fertilization and SS decreased during SF. Horizontal gene transfer via MGEs (especially integrases 45.80%) induced by changes in environmental factors (NO3 -N 14.7% and NH4 +-N) was the main factor responsible for the changes in ARGs. Proteobacteria (14.3%) and Firmicutes were the main potential hosts of ARGs. Network analysis suggested that Ornithinimicrobium, Idiomarina and Corynebacterium had positive correlations with aminoglycosides, MLSB, and tetracycline resistance genes. These results provide new insights to understand the fate of ARGs in the GVP soils by manure-amended combined with SS during SF, which may help to reduce the spread of ARGs.","Wang, Xj; Zhang, L; Gu, J; Feng, Yc; He, K; Jiang, Hh",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121950,Environmental Pollution
Genomic Characterisation Of Multidrug-Resistant Bacillus Toyonensis Strain 4Hc1 Isolated From Marine Plastic In Norway,"Objectives: Bacillus toyonensis is widespread in nature. Multidrug-resistant B. toyonensis strain 4HC1 was isolated from polyethylene submerged in the water column near a beach in Oygarden, Norway. We analysed the whole genome sequence of strain 4HC1 in order to understand the genetic basis of the observed phenotypic antibiotic resistance. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing of B. toyonensis strain 4HC1 was performed on Illumina MiSeq platform using 2 x 300 bp chemistry.

"Research Progress On The Origin, Fate, Impacts And Harm Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wastewater Treatment Plants","Previous studies reported microplastics (MPs), antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). There is still a lack of research progress on the origin, fate, impact and hazards of MPs and ARGs in WWTPs. This paper fills a gap in this regard. In our search, we used microplastics, antibiotic resistance genes, and wastewater treatment plant as topic terms in Web of Science, checking the returned results for relevance by examining paper titles and abstracts. This study mainly explores the following points: (1) the origins and fate of MPs, antibiotics and ARGs in WWTPs; (2) the mechanisms of action of MPs, antibiotics and ARGs in sludge biochemical pools; (3) the impacts of MPs in WWTPs and the spread of ARGs; (4) and the harm inflicted by MPs and ARGs on the environment and human body. Contaminants in sewage sludge such as MPs, ARGs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria enter the soil and water. Contaminants can travel through the food chain and thus reach humans, leading to increased illness, hospitalization, and even mortality.

Effects And Mechanisms Of Polystyrene Micro- And Nano-Plastics On The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes From Soil To Lettuce,"Effects of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil -plant systems are still unclear. To investigate the spread and mechanisms of ARGs from soil to lettuce, lettuce was exposed to soil spiked with two environmentally relevant concentrations of polystyrene MPs (100 mu m) and NPs (100 nm). Results showed that microorganisms that carried ARGs in soil were increased after exposure to MPs/ NPs, which led to an increase in ARGs in roots. NPs were absorbed by roots and can be transported to leaves. Analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics indicated that high concentration of NPs regulated the expression of related genes and proteins and improved the accumulation of flavonoids in the lettuce, therefore decreased the abundance of microorganisms that contained ARGs.

Exposure To Microplastics Reduces The Bioaccumulation Of Sulfamethoxazole But Enhances Its Effects On Gut Microbiota And The Antibiotic Resistome Of Mice,"Microplastics (MPs) have aroused a global health concern and their coexistence with antibiotics is inevitable. However, how MPs would affect the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in humans remains poorly understood. Here a mouse model was used, and through dietary exposure, we observed that while the relative distributions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in tissues were relatively stable, MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues (liver, lung, spleen, heart and kidney). Notably, while SMX and MPs showed a differential effect, MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, with the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes and multidrug genes being significantly increased. We further identified that shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice. Combined, our results demonstrate that MPs reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX, but they enhanced its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice, indicating they might have high risks to humans.","Liu, J; Lv, M; Sun, Aq; Ding, J; Wang, Yq; Chang, Xb; Chen, Lx",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133810,Chemosphere
Bisphenol S Promotes The Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Via Transformation,"The antibiotic resistance crisis has seriously jeopardized public health and human safety. As one of the ways of horizontal transfer, transformation enables bacteria to acquire exogenous genes naturally. Bisphenol compounds are now widely used in plastics, food, and beverage packaging, and have become a new environmental pollutant. However, their potential relationship with the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to assess whether the ubiquitous bisphenol S (BPS) could promote the transformation of plasmid-borne ARGs. Using plasmid pUC19 carrying the ampicillin resistance gene as an extracellular ARG and model microorganism E. coli DH5 alpha as the recipient, we established a transformation system. Transformation assays revealed that environmentally relevant concentrations of BPS (0.1-10 mu g/mL) markedly enhanced the transformation frequency of plasmid-borne ARGs into E. coli DH5 alpha up to 2.02-fold. Fluorescent probes and transcript-level analyses suggest that BPS stimulated increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activated the SOS response, induced membrane damage, and increased membrane fluidity, which weakened the barrier for plasmid transfer, allowing foreign DNA to be more easily absorbed. Moreover, BPS stimulates ATP supply by activating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which promotes flagellar motility and expands the search for foreign DNA. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the role of bisphenol compounds in facilitating the horizontal spread of ARGs and emphasize the need to monitor the residues of these environmental contaminants.","Zhang, Jy; Zhu, Sy; Sun, Jy; Liu, Y",10.3390/ijms25189819,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Microplastisphere May Induce The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Aquatic Environments: A Review,"Microplastics have been proven to be hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The enrichment of ARGs in microplastisphere, the specific niche for diverse microbial communities attached to the surface of microplastic, has attracted worldwide attention. By collecting 477 pairs of ARG abundance data belonging to 26 ARG types, based on the standardized mean difference (SMD) under the random effect model, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the ARG enrichment on microplastics in aquatic environments in order to quantitatively elucidate the enrichment effect, with comparison of non-microplastic materials. It was found that ARGs enriched on the microplastics were more abundant than that on the inorganic substrates (SMD = 0.26) and natural water environments (SMD = 0.10), but lower abundant than that on the natural organic substrates (SMD =-0.52). Furthermore, microplastics in freshwater tended to have a higher degree of ARG enrichment than those in saline water and sewage. The biofilm formation stage, structure, and component of microplasti-sphere may play a significant role in the enrichment of ARGs.","Yu, X; Zhang, Y; Tan, L; Han, Cl; Li, Hx; Zhai, Lf; Ma, Wq; Li, Ct; Lu, Xq",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119891,Environmental Pollution
"Marine Microplastics Enrich Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args), Especially Extracellular Args: An Investigation In The East China Sea","The potential of microplastics to carry coexisting pollutants and contribute to combined pollution is a significant health concern. Here we investigate the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and extracellular ARGs (eARGs) forms, on microplastics collected from the coastal waters of the East China Sea. Our findings revealed that both iARGs and eARGs were enriched on microplastics. Specifically, 6- to 55-fold enrichment of iARGs was found on microplastics, while eARGs were more significantly enriched (5-140 fold). 16s rDNA analysis revealed that microplastics harbored a more diverse microbial community, particularly opportunistic pathogens, compared to surrounding seawater. This contributes to more correlations between bacterial genera and ARGs on microplastics than in sea water. Molecular ecological network analysis indicated that total nitrogen and ammonia were primary determinants of ARG and microbial enrichment on microplastics. This study provides implications for understanding the combined pollution of microplastics and ARGs.","Peng, Rl; Xu, Ys; Li, Rq; Wang, W; Wang, Hl; Zhang, Xy; Yuan, Qb",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117260,Marine Pollution Bulletin

In this study, we compared the microbial composition and the presence of ARGs in water and PE fragments collected from a stream and the seawater in a coastal area of Northwestern Sicily. Our findings showed more ARGs on PE fragments than the corresponding water samples, confirming that PE can act as a carrier of antibiotic-resistance genes causing high damage to the marine environment and living organisms. In this study, we evaluated the microbiome and the resistome profile of water and fragments of polyethylene (PE) waste collected at the same time from a stream and the seawater in a coastal area of Northwestern Sicily. Although a core microbiome was determined by sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene, quantitative differences were found among the microbial communities on PE waste and the corresponding water samples. Our findings indicated that PE waste contains a more abundant and increased core microbiome diversity than the corresponding water samples. Moreover, PCR analysis of specific antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) showed that PE waste harbors more ARGs than the water samples. Thus, PE waste could act as a carrier of antibiotic-resistant microbiota, representing an increased danger for the marine environment and living organisms, as well.","Sucato, A; Vecchioni, L; Savoca, D; Presentato, A; Arculeo, M; Alduina, R",10.3390/biology10030200,Biology-Basel
Microplastic Diversity Increases The Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil,"The impact of microplastics on antibiotic resistance has attracted widespread attention. However, previous studies primarily focused on the effects of individual microplastics. In reality, diverse microplastic types accumulate in soil, and it remains less well studied whether microplastic diversity (i.e., variations in color, shape or polymer type) can be an important driver of increased antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundance. Here, we employed microcosm studies to investigate the effects of microplastic diversity on soil ARG dynamics through metagenomic analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the associated potential health risks by profiling virulence factor genes (VFGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Our findings reveal that as microplastic diversity increases, there is a corresponding rise in the abundance of soil ARGs, VFGs and MGEs. We further identified microbial adaptive strategies involving genes (changed genetic diversity), community (increased specific microbes), and functions (enriched metabolic pathways) that correlate with increased ARG abundance and may thus contribute to ARG dissemination. Additional global change factors, including fungicide application and plant diversity reduction, also contributed to elevated ARG abundance. Our findings suggest that, in addition to considering contamination levels, it is crucial to monitor microplastic diversity in ecosystems due to their potential role in driving the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through multiple pathways. The effects of microplastics (MPs) on soil microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes are not well understood. Here, the authors used microcosm studies to show that MP diversity, and partially fungicide treatment and reduced plant diversity, correlate with higher levels of ARG and related genetic factors.","Wang, Yf; Liu, Yj; Fu, Ym; Xu, Jy; Zhang, Tl; Cui, Hl; Qiao, M; Rillig, Mc; Zhu, Yg; Zhu, D",10.1038/s41467-024-54237-7,Nature Communications
The Formation Of Specific Bacterial Communities Contributes To The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Soil Plastisphere,"Soil serves as a major reservoir of both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics. However, the characteristics of the antibiotic resistome in the soil plastisphere remain largely unknown. In this study, we used metagenomic approaches to reveal the changing patterns of ARGs and the bacterial community and their associations in response to three types of microplastics (light density polyethylene, LDPE; polypropylene, PP; polystyrene, PS) using particles 550 mu m or 75 mu m in diameter. The total ARG abundances significantly increased in the plastisphere and varied across plastic types. The LDPE plastisphere had the highest ARG total abundance and lowest Shannon diversity index, indicating that this plastic had the most severe negative impact on soil bacterial diversity. The PP plastisphere contained higher relative abundances of the pathogenic bacteria Acinetobacter johnsonii and Escherichia coli, demonstrating the higher pathogenic risk of the microbial communities enriched in the plastisphere. Specifically, multidrug resistance genes (ceoB and MuxB) co-existed with more than four microbial taxa, increasing the potential risk of ARG spread in pathogenic bacteria. These findings implied that the plastisphere acts as a hotspot for acquiring and spreading antibiotic resistance and may have long-term negative effects on the soil ecosystem and human health.","Yang, Y; Li, T; Liu, P; Li, Hx; Hu, F",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129247,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastic Wastes And Surface Antibiotic Resistance Genes Pollution In Mangrove Environments,"Mangroves are located at the intersection of land and sea and are also heavily affected by plastic wastes. Biofilms of plastic wastes in mangroves are reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, plastic wastes and ARG pollution were investigated from three typical mangrove areas in Zhanjiang, South China. Transparent was the dominant colors of plastic wastes in three mangroves. Fragment and film shape accounted for 57.73-88.23% of plastic waste samples in mangroves. In addition, 39.50% of plastic wastes in protected area mangroves are PS. The metagenomic results shows that the 175 ARGs were found on plastic wastes of the three mangroves, the abundance accounting for 91.11% of the total ARGs. The abundance of Vibrio accounted for 2.31% of the total bacteria genera in aquaculture pond area mangrove. Correlation analysis shows that a microbe can carry multiple ARGs that may improve resistance to antibiotics. Microbes are the potential hosts of most ARGs, suggesting that ARGs can be transmitted by microbes. Because the mangroves are closely related to human activities and the high abundance of ARGs on plastic increases the ecological risks, people should improve plastic waste management and prevent the spread of ARGs by reducing plastic pollution.","Sun, Rk; Liu, Y; Li, T; Qian, Zj; Zhou, Cx; Hong, Pz; Sun, Sl; Li, Cy",10.1007/s10661-023-11312-8,Environmental Monitoring And Assessment
"Unraveling The Nexus: Microplastics, Antibiotics, And Args Interactions, Threats And Control In Aquaculture - A Review","In recent years, aquaculture has expanded rapidly to address food scarcity and provides high-quality aquatic products. However, this growth has led to the release of significant effluents, containing emerging contaminants like antibiotics, microplastics (MPs), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigated the occurrence and interactions of these pollutants in aquaculture environment. Combined pollutants, such as MPs and coexisting adsorbents, were widespread and could include antibiotics, heavy metals, resistance genes, and pathogens. Elevated levels of chemical pollutants on MPs could lead to the emergence of resistance genes under selective pressure, facilitated by bacterial communities and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). MPs acted as vectors, transferring pollutants into the food web. Various technologies, including membrane technology, coagulation, and advanced oxidation, have been trialed for pollutants removal, each with its benefits and drawbacks. Future research should focus on ecologically friendly treatment technologies for emerging contaminants in aquaculture wastewater. This review provided insights into understanding and addressing newly developing toxins, aiming to develop integrated systems for effective aquaculture wastewater treatment.","Xie, Sy; Hamid, N; Zhang, Tt; Zhang, Zj; Peng, Lc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134324,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
How Micro-/Nano-Plastics Influence The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes - A Review,"Plastic debris such as microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPTs), along with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), are pervasive in the environment and are recognized as significant global health and ecological concerns. Micro-/ nano -plastics (MNPs) have been demonstrated to favor the spread of ARGs by enhancing the frequency of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through various pathways. This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the current study with focus on the influence of plastics on the HGT of ARGs. The critical role of MNPs in the HGT of ARGs has been well illustrated in sewage sludge, livestock farms, constructed wetlands and landfill leachate. A summary of the performed HGT assay and the underlying mechanism of plastic -mediated transfer of ARGs is presented in the paper. MNPs could facilitate or inhibit HGT of ARGs, and their effects depend on the type, size, and concentration. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the effects of MNPs on the HGT of ARGs, and offers suggestions for further study. Further research should attempt to develop a standard HGT assay and focus on investigating the impact of different plastics, including the oligomers they released, under real environmental conditions on the HGT of ARGs.","Wang, Xn; Li, Jh; Pan, Xl",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173881,Science Of The Total Environment
Phthalates Promote Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: An Overlooked Environmental Risk,"Plastics-microorganism interactions have aroused growing environmental and ecological concerns. However, previous studies concentrated mainly on the direct interactions and paid little attention to the ecotoxicology effects of phthalates (PAEs), a common plastic additive that is continuously released and accumulates in the environment. Here, we provide insights into the impacts of PAEs on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among environmental microorganisms. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP, a model PAE) at environmentally relevant concentrations (2-50 mu g/L) significantly boosted the plasmidmediated conjugation transfer of ARGs among intrageneric, intergeneric, and wastewater microbiota by up to 3.82, 4.96, and 4.77 times, respectively. The experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results unveil a strong interaction between the DMP molecules and phosphatidylcholine bilayer of the cell membrane, which lowers the membrane lipid fluidity and increases the membrane permeability to favor transfer of ARGs. In addition, the increased reactive oxygen species generation and conjugation associated gene overexpression under DMP stress also contribute to the increased gene transfer. This study provides fundamental knowledge of the PAE-bacteria interactions to broaden our understanding of the environmental and ecological risks of plastics, especially in niches with colonized microbes, and to guide the control of ARG environmental spreading.","Wu, J; Zhou, Jh; Liu, Df; Wu, J; He, Rl; Cheng, Zh; Li, Hh; Li, Ww",10.1021/acs.est.2c09491,Environmental Science & Technology
Large-Scale Patterns Of Soil Antibiotic Resistome In Chinese Croplands,"Soil is a vital reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but we still know little about their distribution in cropland soils and the main driving forces. Here we performed an investigation for ARGs patterns in 105 cropland soils (planted with maize, peanut or soybean) along a 2, 200 km transect in China using high-throughput quantitative PCR approaches. Totally, 204 ARGs were detected, with a higher diversity found in central China than that in northeast and south China. The most abundant (top 50%) and highly shared (present in >50% samples) ARGs regarded as core resistome were dominated by multidrug resistance genes such as oprJ, acrA-05 and acrA-04. Regressive analyses revealed that the relative abundance of total ARGs and core resistome both had significant relationships with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Anthropogenic factors including the consumption of plastic films and soil properties including heavy metals showed good correlations with the diversity of ARGs. Structural equation modelling analysis further explained that anthropogenic factors were the main forces shaping the ARGs patterns. These findings highlight the importance of human activities in shaping soil antibiotic resistome in the croplands, providing potential management strategies to mitigate the dissemination of ARGs to humans via food chain.

Microplastics Exhibit Accumulation And Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Although the fates of microplastics (0.1-5 mm) in marine environments and freshwater are increasingly studied, little is known about their vector effect in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Previous studies have eval-uated the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on microplastics, but there is no direct evidence for the selection and horizontal transfer of ARGs on different microplastics in WWTPs. Here, we show biofilm for-mation as well as bacterial community and ARGs in these biofilms grown on four kinds of microplastics via incubation in the aerobic and anaerobic tanks of a WWTP. Microplastics showed differential capacities for bacteria and ARGs enrichment, differing from those of the culture environment. Furthermore, ARGs in micro-plastic biofilms were horizontally transferred at frequencies higher than those in water samples in both tanks. Therefore, microplastics in WWTPs can act as substrates for horizontal transfer of ARGs, potentially causing a great harm to the ecological environment and adversely affecting human health.","Feng, Y; Sun, Jw; Shi, Ww; Duan, Jl; Sun, Xd; Feng, Lj; Wang, Q; Gan, Yd; Yuan, Xz",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117632,Journal Of Environmental Management
Microplastics Exacerbate The Ecological Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wetland Ecosystem,"Wetlands are vital components of the global ecosystem, significantly influencing the retention and dissemination of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the effects of different types of MPs on the environmental dynamics of ARGs within these ecosystems remain poorly understood. This study focused on the distribution and composition of ARGs associated with two primary types of MPs-polyethylene and polypropylene-within the Poyang Lake wetland, the largest freshwater lake in China, utilizing metagenomic analysis. The findings demonstrated that the bacterial communities and ARG profiles in the plastisphere were markedly distinct from those in the surrounding water. Specifically, thirteen opportunistic pathogens and forty subtypes of ARGs, primarily related to multidrug, bacitracin, and beta-lactam resistance, were identified in the plastisphere. Notably, polyethylene exhibited four times more specific ARG subtypes than polypropylene. Procrustes analysis combined with network analysis indicated a lack of strong correlation between ARG abundance and bacterial populations, suggesting potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within the microbiota of the plastisphere. Additionally, three novel and functional beta-lactamase genes were identified within this environment. This investigation highlights the role of MPs as reservoirs for ARGs, facilitating their exchange and posing risks to both ecological integrity and human health, thereby underscoring the need for increased attention in future research efforts.","Liu, Sl; Cao, J; Yu, Jl; Jian, Mf; Zou, L",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123359,Journal Of Environmental Management
Plastisphere Showing Unique Microbiome And Resistome Different From Activated Sludge,"Plastisphere (the biofilm on microplastics) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may enrich pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which can cause risks to the ecological environment by discharging into receiving waters. However, the microbiome and resistome of plastisphere in activated sludge (AS) systems remain inconclusive. Here, metagenome was applied to investigate the microbial composition, functions and ARGs of the Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastisphere in lab-scale reactors, and revealed the effects of tetracycline (TC) and/or Cu(II) pressures on them. The results indicated that the plastisphere provided a new niche for microbiota showing unique functions distinct from the AS. Particularly, various potentially pathogenic bacteria tended to enrich in PVC plastisphere. Moreover, various ARGs were detected in plastisphere and AS, but the plastisphere had more potential ARGs hosts and a stronger correlation with ARGs. The ARGs abundances increased after exposure to TC and/or Cu(II) pressures, especially tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs), and the results further showed that TRGs with different resistance mechanisms were separately enriched in plastisphere and AS. Furthermore, the exogenous pressures from Cu(II) or/and TC also enhanced the association of potential pathogens with TRGs in PVC plastisphere. The findings contribute to assessing the potential risks of spreading pathogens and ARGs through microplastics in WWTPs.","Li, Qh; Tian, L; Cai, Xc; Wang, Yc; Mao, Yp",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158330,Science Of The Total Environment
The Critical Role Of Microplastics In The Fate And Transformation Of Sulfamethoxazole And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Within Vertical Subsurface-Flow Constructed Wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are reservoirs of microplastics (MPs) in the environment. However, knowledge about the impact of MPs on antibiotic removal and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is limited. We focused on sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a representative compound to examine the effects of MPs on SMX removal and the proliferation and dissemination of two SMX-related ARGs (sul1 and sul2) in vertical subsurface -flow CW (VFCW) microcosm. The presence of MPs in the substrate was found to enhance the proliferation of microorganisms owing to the large specific surface area of the MPs and the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on MP surfaces, which resulted in a high SMX removal ranging from 97.80 % to 99.80 %. However, the presence of MPs promoted microbial interactions and the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, which led to a significant increase in the abundances of sul1 and sul2 of 68.47 % and 17.20 %, respectively. It is thus imperative to implement rigorous monitoring strategies for MPs to mitigate their potential ecological hazards.","Zhang, Sw; Cui, Ll; Zhao, Yh; Xie, Hj; Song, My; Wu, Hm; Hu, Z; Liang, S; Zhang, J",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133222,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Effects Of Microplastics On Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Recirculating Aquaculture System,"Microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two kinds of emerging contaminants with frequent detection in coastal regions. However, rare information on co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in coastal recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is available. This study performed field sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the distribution of microplastics and ARGs in a typical RAS farm. The results showed that microplastics were detected in all water samples with the abundances ranging from 58 to 72 items/m(3). Absolute abundances of total 10 ARG5 in water samples ranged from 3.24 x 10(5) to 7.83 x 10(5) copies/mL while those on microplastic samples were in the range of 1.59 x 10(9) -1.83 x 10(9) copies/g. Microbial communities of microplastics and water showed significant difference at both phylum and genus levels. Microbial community diversity of microplastics was higher than that of water. ARG5 including tetG, qnrS, sul1, sul2, and ermF possessed relatively more active relationships with bacterial community in water and on microplastics of the RAS farm. The results suggested that microplastics might be an important reservoir of ARGs in RAS farms. The findings of this study will provide useful information on pollution control and environmental management for both microplastics and ARGs in coastal aquaculture systems.","Lu, J; Zhang, Yx; Wu, J; Luo, Ym",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109631,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Plastisphere Enrich Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potential Pathogenic Bacteria In Sewage With Pharmaceuticals,"Microplastics (MPs) and pharmaceuticals are common emerging pollutants in sewage, and their coexistence may have more negative effects on the environments. This study chose tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP) and tridosan (TCS) to investigate the responses of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities on different MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)) biofilms (plastisphere). The adsorption capacity of three pharmaceuticals on PVC and PE decreased in the order of AMP > IC > TCS. PE was more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. MPs led to the increase of the total copies of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the sewage. Importantly, multidrug ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of IC and MPs led to higher risks of spreading ARGs and MGEs. In addition, potential pathogenic bacteria Legionella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria and Arcobacter were more abundant on plastisphere than those in sewage, and these bacteria might be the hosts for ARGs and MGEs. This study showed that plastisphere could be repositories of ARGs and MGEs in sewage and accumulated potential pathogenic bacteria. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A Review On The Effect Of Micro- And Nano-Plastics Pollution On The Emergence Of Antimicrobial Resistance,"The recent upsurge in the studies on micro/nano plastics and antimicrobial resistance genes has proven their deleterious effects on the environmental and human health. Till-date, there is a scarcity of studies on the in-teractions of these two factors and their combined influence. The interaction of microplastics has led to the formation of new plastics namely plastiglomerates, pyroplastics. and anthropoquinas. It has long been ignored that the occurrence of microplastics has become a breeding ground for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Evidently microplastics are also associated with the occurrence of other pollutants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. The increased use of antibiotics (after Covid breakout) has further elevated the detrimental effects on human health. Therefore, this study highlights the relation of microplastics with antibiotic resistance generation. The factors such as uncontrolled use of antibiotics and negligent plastic consumption has been evaluated. Furthermore, the future research prospective was provided that can be helpful in correctly identifying the seriousness of the environmental occurrence of these pollutants.","Gaur, Vk; Sirohi, R; Bhat, Mi; Gautam, K; Sharma, P; Srivastava, Jk; Pandey, A",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136877,Chemosphere
"Responses Of Performance, Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Bacterial Communities Of Partial Nitrification System To Polyamide Microplastics","Polyamide (PA), a prevalent microplastics (MPs), is often collected from wastewater treatment plants. However, the responses of partial nitrification system to PA MPs are unclear. The short-term and long-term effect of PA MPs on the partial nitrification system was slight, but the ammonia oxidation rate decreased slowly with the increase of PA MPs concentration. Meantime, the PA MPs addition could decrease the microbial diversity, alter microbial community structure of the system and facilitate the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including fabI, intI1 and Tn916/1545. Correlation analysis and network analysis indicated that Ferruginibacter, Hyphomicrobium, Terrimonas, Brevundimonas and Plasticicumulans in the system might be the dominant hosts of ARGs. In addition, oligotyping analysis indicated not all oligotypes of the relevant genus showed positive correlation with ARGs. In general, PA MPs had almost no effect on performance but altered community structure and increased ARGs spread risk of the partial nitrification system.","Cui, Yc; Gao, Jf; Zhang, D; Li, Dc; Dai, Hh; Wang, Zq; Zhao, Yf",10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125767,Bioresource Technology
Plastiome: Plastisphere-Enriched Mobile Resistome In Aquatic Environments,"Aquatic microplastics (MPs) act as reservoirs for microbial communities, fostering the formation of a mobile resistome encompassing diverse antibiotic (ARGs) and biocide/metal resistance genes (BMRGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This collective genetic repertoire, referred to as the plastiome,  can potentially perpetuate environmental antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our study examining two Japanese rivers near Tokyo revealed that waterborne MPs are primarily composed of polyethylene and polypropylene fibers and sheets of diverse origin. Clinically important genera like Exiguobacterium and Eubacterium were notably enriched on MPs. Metagenomic analysis uncovered a 3.46-fold higher enrichment of ARGs on MPs than those in water, with multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs) and BMRGs prevailing, particularly within MPs. Specific ARG and BMRG subtypes linked to resistance to vancomycin, beta-lactams, biocides, arsenic, and mercury showed selective enrichment on MPs. Network analysis revealed intense associations between host genera with ARGs, BMRGs, and MGEs on MPs, emphasizing their role in coselection. In contrast, river water exhibited weaker associations. This study underscores the complex interactions shaping the mobile plastiome in aquatic environments and emphasizes the global imperative for research to comprehend and effectively control AMR within the One Health framework.","Guruge, Ks; Goswami, P; Kanda, K; Abeynayaka, A; Kumagai, M; Watanabe, M; Tamamura-Andoh, Y",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134353,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Effects Of Coexistence Of Tetracycline, Copper And Microplastics On The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Manured Soil","The coexistence of antibiotics, heavy metals and microplastics is becoming commonplace and may affect antibiotic resistance in manured soil. The current understanding of the role of microplastics in soil with combined pollution of antibiotics, heavy metals and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is limited. Here, the effects of the coexistence of tetracycline (TC), Cu and environmental microplastics (EM) on the fate of nine ARGs and three heavy metal resistance genes in agricultural soil were investigated by batch and microcosm experiments. EM were obtained by exposing virgin microplastics to soil environments for 80 days, which exhibited higher adsorption affinity for Cu and TC than soil particles and virgin microplastics. 1% EM in soil increased bioavailable concentrations of TC and Cu by 79-138% and 88-135%, respectively, and decreased TC dissipation from 11.79 mg kg(-1) to 3.08 mg kg(-1). Correspondingly, the total relative abundances of target ARGs increased by 219-348%. The significant correlations of tetG, tetB, tetQ, sul2, sul1 and intl1 with bioavailable fractions of TC and Cu in soil environments were revealed by network analysis. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs showed the special plastisphere around EM. Attributed to the biofilm generation and higher pollutant accumulation in the plastisphere, EM could be the source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ARGs in soil environments. Structure equation models further identified that indirect effects of EM acted a major role in the propagation of ARGs by altering soil properties, soil microbial diversity and intl1 abundance. This study revealed that EM could increase the stimulative effects of Cu and TC on antibiotic resistance and magnify the environmental risk of manure application in soil environments.

Microplastics Exacerbate Co-Occurrence And Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Microplastic pollution is a rising environmental issue worldwide. Microplastics can provide a niche for the microbiome, especially for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could increase the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the interactions between microplastics and ARGs are still indistinct in environmental settings. Microplastics were found to be significantly correlated with ARGs (p < 0.001), based on the analysis of samples taken from a chicken farm and its surrounding farmlands. Analysis of chicken feces revealed the highest abundance of microplastics (14.9 items/g) and ARGs (6.24 x108 copies/g), suggesting that chicken farms could be the hotspot for the co-spread of microplastics and ARGs. Conjugative transfer experi-ments were performed to investigate the effects of microplastic exposure for different concentrations and sizes on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs between bacteria. Results showed that the microplastics significantly enhanced the bacterial conjugative transfer frequency by 1.4-1.7 folds indicating that microplastics could aggravate ARG dissemination in the environment. Potential mechanisms related to the up-regulation of rpoS, ompA, ompC, ompF, trbBp, traF, trfAp, traJ, and down-regulation of korA, korB, and trbA were induced by microplastics. These findings highlighted the co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in the agricultural environment and the exacerbation of ARGs' prevalence via rising the HGT derived from microplastics.","Yu, X; Zhou, Zc; Shuai, Xy; Lin, Zj; Liu, Z; Zhou, Jy; Lin, Yh; Zeng, Gs; Ge, Zy; Chen, H",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131130,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"A Holistic Review On Triclosan And Triclocarban Exposure: Epidemiological Outcomes, Antibiotic Resistance, And Health Risk Assessment","Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are antimicrobials that are widely applied in personal care products, textiles, and plastics. TCS and TCC exposure at low doses may disturb hormone levels and even facilitate bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In the post-coronavirus disease pandemic era, chronic health effects and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes associated with TCS and TCC exposure represent an increasing concern. This study sought to screen and review the exposure levels and sources and changes after the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, potential health outcomes, bacterial resistance and cross-resistance, and health risk assessment tools associated with TCS and TCC exposure. Daily use of antimicrobial products accounts for most observed associations between internal exposure and diseases, while secondary exposure at trace levels mainly lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The roles of altered gut microbiota in multi-system toxicities warrant further attention. Sublethal dose of TCC selects ARGs without obviously increasing tolerance to TCC. But TCS induce persistent TCS resistance and reversibly select antibiotic resistance, which highlights the benefits of minimizing its use. To derive reference doses (RfDs) for humans, more sensitive endpoints observed in populational studies need to be confirmed using toxicological tests. Additionally, the human equivalent dose is recommended to be incorporated into the health risk assessment to reduce uncertainty of extrapolation.","Zhang, D; Lu, Sy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162114,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects Of Freeze-Thaw Dynamics And Microplastics On The Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil Aggregates,"This is the first study investigating the effects of freeze-thaw (FT) and microplastics (MPs) on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil aggregates (i.e., soil basic constituent and functional unit) via micro-cosm experiments. The results showed that FT significantly increased the total relative abundance of target ARGs in different aggregates due to the increase in intI1 and ARG host bacteria. However, polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) hindered the increase in ARG abundance caused by FT. The host bacteria carrying ARGs and intI1 varied with aggregate size, and the highest number of hosts was observed in micro-aggregates (<0.25 mm). FT and MPs altered host bacteria abundance by affecting aggregate physicochemical properties and bacterial community and enhanced multiple antibiotic resistance via vertical gene transfer. Although the dominant factors affecting ARGs varied with aggregate size, intI1 was a co-dominant factor in various-sized aggregates. Furthermore, other than ARGs, FT, PE-MPs, and their integration promoted the proliferation of human pathogenic bacteria in aggregates. These findings suggested that FT and its integration with MPs significantly affected ARG distribution in soil aggregates. They amplified antibiotic resistance environmental risks, contributing to a profound understanding of soil antibiotic resistance in the boreal region.","Xu, Fk; Guan, Jn; Zhou, Ym; Song, Zw; Shen, Yp; Liu, Yb; Jia, Xh; Zhang, By; Guo, P",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138678,Chemosphere
"Effects Of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics And Benzylalkyldimethylethyl Compounds On System Performance, Microbial Community And Resistance Genes In Sulfur Autotrophic Denitrification System","Benzylalkyldimethylethyl ammonium compounds (BAC) and polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC MPs), as the frequently detected pollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), have attracted more concerns on their ecosystem risks. Therefore, this study investigated how the sulfur autotrophic denitrification (SAD) system responded to the single and joint stress of PVC MPs (1, 10 and 100 mg/L) and BAC (0.5, 5 and 10 mg/L). After 100 days of operation, the presence of 10 mg/L BAC led to obviously inhibitory effects on system performance and microbial metabolic activity. And the additions of PVC MPs or/and BAC stimulated the proliferation of intracellular resistance genes (RGs), whereas exposure to BAC increased the abundances of extracellular RGs and free RGs in water more significantly. Compared to the joint stress, BAC single stress resulted in higher abundances of free RGs in water, which further increased the risk of RGs propagation. Moreover, the interaction between mobile genetic elements and extracellular polymeric substances further increased the spread of RGs.","Wang, Yx; Gao, Jf; Wang, Zq; Zhao, Yf; Yuan, Yk; Sun, Lx; Zeng, Lq; Wang, Hy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135197,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Bacterial Community Succession And The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In An Oyster Farm,"Microplastics can be colonized by microorganisms and form plastisphere. However, knowledge of bacterial community succession and the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens on microplastics in aquaculture environments is limited. Here, we conducted a 30-day continuous exposure experiment at an oyster farm. Results showed that the alpha-diversity of communities on most microplastics continuously increased and was higher than in planktonic communities after 14 days. Microplastics could selectively enrich certain bacteria from water which can live a sessile lifestyle and promote colonization by other bacteria. The composition and function of plastisphere communities were distinct from those in the surrounding water and influenced by polymer type and exposure time. Microplastics can enrich ARGs (sul1, qnrS and blaTEM) and harbor potential pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Therefore, microplastic pollution may pose a critical threat to aquaculture ecosystems and human health. Our study provides further insight into the ecological risks of microplastics.","Xiao, Sj; Zhang, Y; Wu, Yj; Li, Jc; Dai, Wj; Pang, K; Liu, Y; Wu, Rr",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115402,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Parity In Bacterial Communities And Resistomes: Microplastic And Natural Organic Particles In The Tyrrhenian Sea,"Petroleum-based microplastic particles (MPs) are carriers of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, influencing the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. This research characterized MP and natural organic particle (NOP) bacterial communities and resistomes in the Tyrrhenian Sea, a region impacted by plastic pollution and climate change. MP and NOP bacterial communities were similar but different from the free-living planktonic communities. Likewise, MP and NOP ARG abundances were similar but different (higher) from the planktonic communities. MP and NOP metagenome-assembled genomes contained ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements and exhibited co-occurrence with metal resistance genes. Overall, these findings show that MPs and NOPs harbor potential pathogenic and antimicrobial resistant bacteria, which can aid in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Further, petroleum-based MPs do not represent novel ecological niches for allochthonous bacteria; rather, they synergize with NOPs, collectively facilitating the spread of antimicrobial resistance in marine ecosystems.","Di Cesare, A; Sathicq, Mb; Sbaffi, T; Sabatino, R; Manca, D; Breider, F; Coudret, S; Pinnell, Lj; Turner, Jw; Corno, G",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116495,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Insight Into The Responses Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Biofilms To Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles And Zinc Ions Pressures In Landfill Leachate,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms are hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in landfill environment. MP biofilms in landfill leachate coexist with heavy metals and metallic nanoparticles (NPs) that considered to be the selective agents of ARGs. However, the effects of these selective pressures on ARGs in MP biofilms and their differences in MP-surrounding leachate have not been well understood. Herein, the changes of ARG abundances in MP biofilms and corresponding leachate under zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs and zinc ion (Zn2+) pressures were comparatively analyzed. The presence of ZnO NPs and Zn2+ promoted the enrichment of ARGs in MP biofilms, and the enrichment was more pronounced in ZnO NPs groups. ZnO NPs and especially Zn2+ mainly decreased the abundances of ARGs in leachate. The increase of integron abundances and reactive oxygen species production in MP biofilms implied the enhanced potential for horizontal transfer of ARGs under ZnO NPs and Zn2+ pressures. Meanwhile, the co-occurrence pattern between ARGs and bacterial genera in MP biofilms with more diverse potential ARG hosts was more complex than in leachate, and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria in MP biofilms under ZnO NPs and Zn2+ pressures supported the enrichment of ARGs.","Shi, Jh; Lv, By; Wang, Bh; Xie, B",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132096,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
The Phenomenon Of Antibiotic Resistance In The Polar Regions: An Overview Of The Global Problem,"The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance is a global problem in human and animal health. This leads to a reduction in the therapeutic effectiveness of the measures used so far and to the limitation of treatment options, which may pose a threat to human health and life. The problem of phenomenon of antibiotic resistance affects more and more the polar regions. This is due to the increase in tourist traffic and the number of people staying at research stations, unmodernised sewage systems in inhabited areas, as well as the migration of animals or the movement of microplastics, which may contain resistant bacteria. Research shows that the presence of antibiotic resistance genes is more dominant in zones of human and wildlife influence than in remote areas. In a polluted environment, there is evidence of a direct correlation between human activity and the spread and survival of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Attention should be paid to the presence of resistance to synthetic and semi-synthetic antibiotics in the polar regions, which is likely to be correlated with human presence and activity, and possible steps to be taken. We need to understand many more aspects of this, such as bacterial epigenetics and environmental stress, in order to develop effective strategies for minimizing the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Studying the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in regions with less anthropogenic activity could provide insight into the diversity of primary genes and explain the historical evolution of antibiotic resistance.","Depta, J; Niedzwiedzka-Rystwej, P",10.2147/IDR.S369023,Infection And Drug Resistance
Microplastic Biofilms Promote The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Estuarine Environments,"As emerging pollutants, microplastics can aggregate microorganisms on their surfaces and form biofilms, enriching antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Consequently, microplastic biofilms have become a focal point of research. Horizontal gene transfer is one of the primary mechanisms by which bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance, with much of the research focusing on suspended bacteria. However, microplastic biofilms, as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer, also merit significant investigation. This study primarily explored and compared the frequency of ARG conjugative transfer between suspended bacteria and microplastic biofilms. The results demonstrated that, compared to suspended bacteria, microplastic biofilms enhanced the frequency of ARG conjugative transfer by 7.2-19.6 times. Among them, biofilms on polyethylene microplastics showed the strongest promotion of conjugation. After the formation of microplastic biofilms, there was a significant increase in bacterial density within the biofilms, which raised the collision frequency of donor and recipient bacteria. Then microplastic biofilms facilitated the gene expression levels of outer membrane proteins, enhanced bacterial gene transfer capabilities, promoted the synthesis of conjugative pili, accelerated the formation of conjugative pairing systems, and elevated the expression levels of genes related to DNA replication and transfer systems, thereby enhancing the conjugative transfer of ARGs within microplastic biofilms. Among different types of microplastic biofilms, polyethylene biofilms exhibited the highest bacterial density, thus showing the highest frequency of ARG conjugation. This study highlights the risks associated with ARG conjugative transfer following the formation of microplastic biofilms and provides insights into the risks of microplastic and antibiotic resistance propagation in estuarine environments.","Zhou, Yy; Zhang, Gs; Zhang, Dw; Zhu, Nz; Bo, Jp; Meng, Xz; Chen, Y; Qin, Y; Liu, Hj; Li, Wy",10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106777,Marine Environmental Research
"Sources, Interactions, Influencing Factors And Ecological Risks Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil: A Review","Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are gaining increasing attention as they pose a threat to the ecological environment and human health as emerging contaminants. MPs has been proved to be a hot spot in ARGs, and although it has been extensively studied in water environment, the results of bibliometrics statistical analysis in this paper showed that relevant studies in soil ecological environment are currently in the initial stage. In view of this, the paper provides a systematic review of the sources, interactions, influencing factors, and ecological risks associated with MPs and ARGs in soil environments. Additionally, the mechanism and influencing factors of plastisphere formation and resistance are elaborated in detail. The MPs properties, soil physicochemical properties, soil environmental factors and agricultural activities are the primarily factors affecting the interaction between MPs and ARGs in soil. Challenges and development directions of related research in the future are also prospected. It is hoped that the review could assist in a deeper comprehension and exploration of the interaction mechanism between MPs and ARGs in soil as well as the function of MPs in the transmission process of ARGs among diverse environmental media and organisms, and provide theory basis and reference for the MPs and ARGs pollution control and remediation in soil.","Zhang, X; Zhao, Bw; Zhang, Y; Zhang, J; Li, Yq; Zhong, Jk; Diao, Jr; Ma, Ff; Liu, H; Duan, Kx",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175226,Science Of The Total Environment
Co-Exposure Of Microplastics And Sulfamethoxazole Propagated Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Sediments By Regulating The Microbial Carbon Metabolism,"The concerns on the carriers of microplastics (MPs) on co-existing pollutants in aquatic environments are sharply rising in recent years. However, little is known about their interactions on the colonization of microbiota, especially for the spread of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influences on the propagation of ARGs in sediments by the co-exposure of different MPs and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The results showed that the presence of MPs significantly enhanced the contents of total organic carbon, while having no effects on the removal of SMX in sediments. Exposure to SMX and MPs obviously activated the microbial carbon utilization capacities based on the BIOLOG method. The propagation of ARGs in sediments was activated by SMX, which was further promoted by the presence of polylactic acid (PLA) MPs, but significantly lowered by the co-exposed polyethylene (PE) MPs. This apparent difference may be attributed to the distinct influence on the antibiotic efflux pumps of two MPs. Moreover, the propagation of ARGs may be also dominated by microbial carbon metabolism in sediments, especially through regulating the carbon sources of carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This study provides new insights into the carrier effects of MPs in sediments.","Chen, Yf; Yan, Zh; Zhang, Y; Zhu, Py; Jiang, Rr; Wang, M; Wang, Yh; Lu, Gh",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132951,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Alteration Of The Migration Trajectory Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes By Microplastics In A Leachate Activated Sludge System,"The environmental behavior of emerging contaminants of microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the leachate activated sludge system has been monitored and analyzed comprehensively. The results suggested that MPs could effectively alter the migration trajectory of tetracycline resistance genes (tet genes) in the leachate activated sludge system under intermittent and continuous influent conditions. After adding MPs, the total average abundance of tet genes in leachate increased from 0.74 +/- 0.07 to 0.78 +/- 0.07 (log10 tet genes/log10 16S rRNA) and that in sludge increased from 0.65 +/- 0.08 to 0.70 +/- 0.06 (log10 tet genes/ log10 16S rRNA). Except for tetA, the abundance of tetB, tetO, tetM and tetQ on MPs increased with increasing TC concentration under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. MPs not only significantly affect the abundance level and migration trajectory of ARGs in the leachate activated sludge system, but also remarkably improve the level of heavy metals in the ambient environment, indirectly promoting the selective effect of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and promoting the development of antibiotic resistance (AR). In addition, MPs changed their physicochemical properties and released hazardous substances with aging to force tet genes to migrate from the leachate activated sludge system to the MPs, making AR more difficult to eliminate and persisted in wastewater treatment plants. Meanwhile, microorganisms played a driving role, making MPs serve as a niche for ARGs and ARB colonization. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated the specific distribution pattern of tet genes and microorganisms in different media, and the potential host was speculated. This study improves the understanding of the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants in leachate activated sludge system and lays a theoretical for protecting the ecological environment.","Liu, Hy; Li, H; Qiu, Lb; Xie, Qa; Lu, Yy; Chen, Bh; Wang, H; Long, Yy; Hu, Lf; Fang, Cr",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121981,Environmental Pollution
"Effect Of Microplastics On Oxytetracycline Trophic Transfer: Immune, Gut Microbiota And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Responses","Microplastics and antibiotics are prevalent and emerging pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, but their interactions in aquatic food chains remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of polypropylene microplastics (PP -MPs) on oxytetracycline (OTC) trophic transfer from the shrimp ( Neocaridina denticulate ) to crucian carp ( Carassius auratus ) by metagenomic sequencing. The carrier effects of PP -MPs promoted OTC bioaccumulation and trophic transfer, which exacerbated enterocyte vacuolation and hepatocyte eosinophilic necrosis. PP -MPs enhanced the inhibitory effect of OTC on intestinal lysozyme activities and complement C3 levels in shrimp and fish, and hepatic immunoglobulin M levels in fish (p < 0.05). Co -exposure of MPs and OTC markedly increased the abundance of Actinobacteria in shrimp and Firmicutes in fish, which caused disturbances in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Moreover, OTC exacerbated the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic animals, and PP -MPs significantly increased the diversity and abundance of ARGs and facilitated the trophic transfer of teta and tetm . Our findings disclosed the impacts of PP -MPs on the mechanism of antibiotic toxicity in aquatic food chains and emphasized the importance of gut microbiota for ARGs trophic transfer, which contributed to a deeper understanding of potential risks posed by complex pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.","Zhang, P; Lu, Gh; Sun, Y; Yan, Zh; Zhang, Lb; Liu, Jc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134147,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Tire Particles And Its Leachates: Impact On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Coastal Sediments,"Tire particles (TPs), a significant group of microplastics, can be discharged into the coastal environments in various ways. However, our understanding of how TPs impact the antibiotic resistance and pathogenic risks of microorganisms in coastal sediments remains limited. In this study, we used metagenomics to investigate how TPs and their leachates could affect the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and their potential risks to the living creatures such as soil invertebrates and microorganisms in the coastal sediments. We discovered that TP addition significantly increased the abundance and diversity of ARGs and VFGs in coastal sediments, with raw TPs displayed higher impacts than TP leachates and TPs after leaching on ARGs and VFGs. With increasing TP exposure concentrations, the co-occurrence frequency of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the same contig also increased, suggesting that TPs could enhance the dispersal risk of ARGs. Our metagenome-based binning analysis further revealed that exposure to TPs increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB). In addition, chemical additives of TP leachates (e.g., Zn and N-cyclohexylformamide) significantly affected the changes of ARGs in the pore water. In summary, our study provides novel insights into the adverse effects of TP pollutions on aggravating the dissemination and pathogenic risks of ARGs and PARB in the coastal environment.","Xu, Jy; Ding, J; Du, S; Zhu, D",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133333,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Effects Of Emerging Pollutants On The Occurrence And Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Review,"The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become major concerns for both public health and environmental ecosystems. Emerging pollutants (EPs) that accumulate in environmental compartments also pose a potential risk for the enrichment of ARGs in indigenous microorganisms. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of EPs, including microplastics, engineered nanomaterials, disinfection byproducts, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, on the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs. State-of-the-art methods for identifying culture-independent ARG-host interactions and monitoring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes in real-time are first reviewed. The contributions of EPs to the abundance and diversity of ARGs are then summarized. Finally, we discussed the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of HGT, increased mutagenesis, and the evolution of microbial communities. Further details of three HGT (i.e., conjugation, transformation, and transduction) frequency patterns in response to various EPs are also examined.

"Unraveling The Effect Of Micro/Nanoplastics On The Occurrence And Horizontal Transfer Of Environmental Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Advances, Mechanisms And Future Prospects","Microplastics can not only serve as vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but also they and even nanoplastics potentially affect the occurrence of ARGs in indigenous environmental microorganisms, which have aroused great concern for the development of antibiotic resistance. This article specifically reviews the effects of micro/nanoplastics (concentration, size, exposure time, chemical additives) and their interactions with other pollutants on environmental ARGs dissemination. The changes of horizontal genes transfer (HGT, i.e., conjugation, transformation and transduction) of ARGs caused by micro/nanoplastics were also summarized. Further, this review systematically sums up the mechanisms of micro/nanoplastics regulating HGT process of ARGs, including reactive oxygen species production, cell membrane permeability, transfer-related genes expression, extracellular polymeric substances production, and ARG donor-recipient adsorption/contaminants adsorption/ biofilm formation. The underlying mechanisms in changes of bacterial communities induced by micro/nanoplastics were also discussed as it was an important factor for structuring the profile of ARGs in the actual environment, including causing environmental stress, providing carbon sources, forming biofilms, affecting pollutants distribution and environmental factors. This review contributes to a systematical understanding of the potential risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination caused by micro/nanoplastics and provokes thinking about perspectives for future research and the management of micro/nanoplastics and plastics.","Shi, Jh; Sun, Cl; An, Tx; Jiang, Ch; Mei, Sl; Lv, By",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174466,Science Of The Total Environment
Silver Nanoparticles Facilitate Phage-Borne Resistance Gene Transfer In Planktonic And Microplastic-Attached Bacteria,"The spread of bacteriophage-borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) poses a realistic threat to human health. Nanomaterials, as important emerging pollutants, have potential impacts on ARGs dissemination in aquatic environments. However, little is known about its role in transductive transfer of ARGs mediated by bacteriophage in the presence of microplastics. Therefore, this study comprehensively investigated the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the transfer of bacteriophage-encoded ARGs in planktonic Escherichia coli and microplastic-attached biofilm. AgNPs exposure facilitated the phage transduction in planktonic and microplasticattached bacteria at ambient concentration of 0.1 mg/L. Biological binding mediated by phage-specific recognition, rather than physical aggregation conducted by hydrophilicity and zeta-potential, dominated the bacterial adhesion of AgNPs. The aggregated AgNPs in turn resulted in elevated oxidative stress and membrane destabilization, which promoted the bacteriophage infection to planktonic bacteria. AgNPs exposure could disrupt colanic acid biosynthesis and then reduce the thickness of biofilm on microplastics, contributing to the transfer of phage-encoded ARGs. Moreover, the roughness of microplastics also affected the performance of AgNPs on the transductive transfer of ARGs in biofilms. This study reveals the compound risks of nanomaterials and microplastics in phage-borne ARGs dissemination and highlights the complexity in various environmental scenarios.","Zhang, Qr; Zhou, Hx; Jiang, P; Wu, Lj; Xiao, X",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133942,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Selective Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens On Polystyrene Microplastics In Landfill Leachate,"Landfill leachate is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs). However, the enrichment characteristics of ARGs on MPs and the effect of MPs' presence on ARGs in surrounding leachates are little studied. Therefore, we investigated the differences of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), bacterial communities and pathogens on polystyrene MPs, in MPs-surrounding leachate and in control (leachate with the absence ofMPs). The results revealed that ARGs were selectively enriched onMPs, which was similar in three types of leachate environments. The genes strB and blaTEM were maximally enriched and mefA, ermB, tetM and tetQ were slightly enriched on MPs, and the degree of ARGs enrichment increased with time during the 60 days of the experiment. Furthermore, compared to the leachate, MPswere observed to have the higher abundances of MGEs and distinct bacterial communities, both of which were closely associated with ARGs on MPs. Pathogens were distinct and more abundant on MPs compared to that in leachate, and 11 pathogens were identified as potential hosts for ARGs on MPs. Additionally, the presence of MPs (500 mg/L) induced few changes in ARGs' abundances, MGEs' abundances and bacterial communities in MP-surrounding leachate within 60 days. Overall, this study suggested that MPs could selectively enrich ARGs and pathogens from the surrounding environments, which promoted the understanding of the combined pollution properties of MPs and ARGs.

Selective Enrichment Of High-Risk Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Priority Pathogens In Freshwater Plastisphere: Unique Role Of Biodegradable Microplastics,"Microplastics (MPs) has been concerned as emerging vectors for spreading antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in aquatic environments, but the role of biodegradable MPs remains largely unknown. Herein, field in-situ incubation method combined with metagenomic sequencing were employed to reveal the dispersal characteristics of microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and virulence factors (VFs) enriched by MPs biofilms. Results showed that planktonic microbes were more prone to enrich on biodegradable MPs (i.e., polyhydroxyalkanoate and polylactic acid) than non-biodegradable MPs (i.e., polystyrene, polypropylene and polyethylene). Distinctive microbial communities were assembled on biodegradable MPs, and the abundances of ARGs, MGEs, and VFs on biofilms of biodegradable MPs were much higher than that of non-biodegradable MPs. Notably, network analysis showed that the biodegradable MPs selectively enriched pathogens carrying ARGs, VFs and MGEs concurrently, suggesting a strong potential risks of cospreading antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity through horizontal gene transfer. According to WHO priority list of Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens (ARPs) and ARGs health risk assessment framework, the highest abundances of Priority 1 ARPs and Rank I risk ARGs were found on polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoate, respectively. These findings elucidate the unique and critical role of biodegradable MPs for selective enrichment of high-risk ARGs and priority pathogens in freshwater environments.","Wang, F; Hu, Zx; Wang, Wj; Wang, Jx; Xiao, Yy; Shi, Jl; Wang, C; Mai, Wc; Li, Gy; An, Tc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135901,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Impact Of Plastic Particles On The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes To Bacterium: Dependent On Particle Sizes And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Vector Replication Capacities,"Plastic particles impact the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environmental media, and their perturbation on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs is recognized as a critical influencing mechanism. However, studies concerning the influence and influencing mechanisms of plastic particles on the HGT of ARGs were limited, particularly for the effect of particle sizes and ARG vector-associated mechanisms. This study explored the impact of polystyrene (PS) particles with sizes of 75, 90, 100, 1000, and 10000 nm on the HGT (via transformation) of ARGs mediated by pUC19, pSTV29, and pBR322 plasmids into Escherichia coli cells. PS particles with sizes <= 100 nm impacted the transformation of ARGs, but large particles (1000 and 10000 nm) showed no obvious effects. Effects of PS particles on the transfer of three plasmids were vastly distinct. For pUC19 with high replication capacities, the transfer was monotonously promoted. However, for pSTV29 and pBR322 with low replication capacities, suppressing effects were observed. This was attributed to two competing mechanisms. The enhancing mechanism was that the direct interaction of PS particles with membrane lipids and the indirect effect associated with bacterial oxidative stress response induced pore formation on the cell membrane and increased membrane permeability, thus enhancing plasmid entrance. The inhibiting mechanism was that PS particles interfered with plasmid replication inside E. coli, thus decreasing the bacterial tranformation. This study deepened our understanding of the environmental dissemination of ARGs in plastic contamination.","Hu, Xj; Waigi, Mg; Yang, B; Gao, Yz",10.1021/acs.est.2c00745,Environmental Science & Technology
The Effect Of Bulk-Biochar And Nano-Biochar Amendment On The Removal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Contaminated Soil,"Biochar amendment has significant benefits in removing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil. Nevertheless, there is little information on ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. Herein, a 42-day soil microcosm experiment were carried out to study how two coconut shell biochars (bulk- and nano-size) eliminate soil ARGs with/without microplastic presence. The results showed that microplastic increased significantly the numbers and abundances of ARGs in soil at 14d of cultivation. And, two biochars amendment effectively inhibited soil ARGs spread whether or not microplastic was present, especially for nano-biochar which had more effective removal compared to bulk-biochar. However, microplastic weakened soil ARGs removal after applying same biochar. Two biochars removed ARGs through decreasing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, potential host-bacteria abundances, some bacteria crowding the eco-niche of hosts and promoting soil properties. The adverse effect of microplastic on ARGs removal was mainly caused by weakening mobile genetic elements (MGEs) removal, and by changing soil properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that biochar's effect on ARGs profile was changed by its size and microplastic presence through altering MGEs abundances. These results highlight that biochar amendment is still an effective method for ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil.","Su, Xm; Qian, Fh; Bao, Yy",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117488,Environmental Research
A Review Focusing On Mechanisms And Ecological Risks Of Enrichment And Propagation Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Mobile Genetic Elements By Microplastic Biofilms,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging ubiquitous pollutants in aquatic environment and have received extensive global attention. In addition to the traditional studies related to the toxicity of MPs and their carrier effects, their unique surface -induced biofilm formation also increases the ecotoxicity potential of MPs from multiple perspectives. In this review, the ecological risks of MPs biofilms were summarized and assessed in detail from several aspects, including the formation and factors affecting the development of MPs biofilms, the selective enrichment and propagation mechanisms of current pollution status of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MPs biofilms, the dominant bacterial communities in MPs biofilms, as well as the potential risks of ARGs and MGEs transferring from MPs biofilms to aquatic organisms. On this basis, this paper also put forward the inadequacy and prospects of the current research and revealed that the MGEsmediated ARG propagation on MPs under actual environmental conditions and the ecological risk of the transmission of ARGs and MGEs to aquatic organisms and human beings are hot spots for future research.

We have characterized, over one year, the evolution of the eukaryotic and bacterial communities colonizing four everyday plastic items deployed in two sites of the same river with different anthropogenic impact. alpha-diversity analyses showed that site had a significant role in bacterial and eukaryotic diversity, with the most impacted site having higher values of the Shannon diversity index. beta-diversity analyses showed that site explained most of the sample variation followed by substrate type (i.e., plastic item) and time since first colo-nization. In this regard, core microbiomes/biomes in each plastic at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months could be identified at genus level, giving a global overview of the evolution of the plastisphere over time. The measured concentration of antibiotics in the river water positively correlated with the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on the plastics.

Interactions Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Their Effects On The Aquaculture Environments,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become the increasing attention and global research hotpots due to their unique ecological and environmental effects. As susceptible locations for MPs and ARGs, aquaculture environments play an important role in their enrichment and transformation. In this review, we focused on the MPs, ARGs, and the effects of their interactions on the aquaculture environments. The facts that antibiotics have been widely applied in different kinds of agricultural productions (e.g., aquaculture) and that most of antibiotics enter the water environment with rainfall and residual in the aquaculture environment have been resulting in the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). Moreover, the water MPs are effective carriers of the environmental microbes and ARB, making them likely to be continuously imported into the aquaculture environments. As a result, the formation of the compound pollutions may also enter the aquatic organisms through the food chains and eventually enter the human body after a long-term enrichment. Furthermore, the compound pollutions result in the joint toxic effects on the human health and the ecological environment. In summary, this review aims to emphasize the ecological effects and the potential hazards on the aquaculture environments where interactions between MPs and ARGs results, and calls for to reduce the use of the plastic products and the antibiotics in the aquaculture environments.","Dong, H; Chen, Yl; Wang, J; Zhang, Y; Zhang, P; Li, X; Zou, Jx; Zhou, Ag",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123961,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Distinct Profile Of Bacterial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Ganjiang River At The Watershed Level,"Microplastics are of great public concern due to their wide distribution and the potential risk to humans and animals. In this study, the microplastic pollution associated with bacterial communities, human pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated compared to water, sediment, and natural wood particles. Microplastics were widely distributed in surface water of the Ganjiang River at a watershed level with an average value of 407 particles m(-3). The fragment was the main microplastic shape found in the basin. Microplastics had significantly higher observed species and Chao1 index of bacterial communities than those in water, but comparable to wood particles. However, there was no difference in the microplastics pollution and alpha diversity indices of bacterial between different reaches along the Ganjiang River. Flavobacterium, Rhodoferax, Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium on the microplastics were all found to be enriched compared with water and sediment. Principal component analysis of the composition and function profile of bacterial communities showed that microplastics provide a new microbial niche in the Ganjiang River, which was distinct from water, sediment, and natural wood. Pseudomonas genus dominated the composition of human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics, which was significantly different from water and sediment. No difference was observed in the relative abundance of total ARGs among the four media. However, microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs compared with water and sediment.","Hu, H; Jin, Df; Yang, Yy; Zhang, J; Ma, Cp; Qiu, Zm",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111363,Environmental Research
Do Combined Nanoscale Polystyrene And Tetracycline Impact On The Incidence Of Resistance Genes And Microbial Community Disturbance In Enchytraeus Crypticus?,"It has been proved that nanoplastics can effectively adsorb pollutants and thus influence their behavior and availability. The combined toxic effects of nanoplastic and its adsorbed pollutant on the soil fauna are still not well known. We used high-throughput quantitative PCR to explore the effects of oral nanoscale polystyrene and tetracycline exposure on antibiotic resistance genes in the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus, and used bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplification sequencing to examine the response of the microbiome of E. crypticus. After 14 days of tetracycline and nanoscale polystyrene exposure, we terminated exposure and monitored the restoration of ARGs and microbiome in the E. crypticus. Results showed that the number of ARGs, especially macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), tetracycline ARGs, as well as multidrug ARGs, increased with exposure to nanoscale polystyrene and tetracycline. The abundance of Aminoglycoside and Beta_Lactamase ARGs in E. crypticus also significantly increased. The exposure significantly perturbed the abundance of families Microbacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Sphinomonadaceae.

Microplastics Deteriorate The Removal Efficiency Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Aerobic Sludge Digestion,"Sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is considered to be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can be efficiently removed by sludge treatment processes, e.g., aerobic sludge digestion. However, recent studies report microplastics, which also accumulate in sludge, may serve as carriers for ARGs. In the presence of microplastics, whether ARGs can still be efficiently destroyed by aerobic sludge digestion remains to be urgently investigated. In this study, the fate of ARGs during aerobic digestion was investigated with and without the addition of three prevalent categories of (i.e., polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)). Nine ARGs and class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) that represents the horizontal transfer potential of ARGs were tested in this study. Compared with the control, the ARGs removal efficiency decreased by 129.6%, 137.0%, and 227.6% with the presence of PVC, PE, and PET, respectively, although a negligible difference was observed with their solids reduction efficiencies. The abundance of potential bacterial hosts of ARGs and intI1 increased in the reactors with the addition of microplastics, suggesting that microplastics potentially selectively enriched bacterial hosts and promoted the horizontal transfer of ARGs during aerobic sludge digestion. These may have contributed to the deteriorated ARGs removal efficiency. This study demonstrated that microplastics in sludge would decrease the ARGs removal efficiency in aerobic digestion process, potentially leading to more ARGs entering the local environment during sludge disposal or utilization.

Fate And Transport Of Biological Microcontaminants Bound To Microplastics In The Soil Environment,"Microplastics, fragmented plastic particles with a maximum dimension <5 mm, are an emerging contaminant of concern that can also serve as a vector of other chemical and biological contaminants. Compared to chemical contam-inants, the potential of microplastics to adsorb biological microcontaminants such as antibiotic resistance genes, small interference RNAs, and pathogenic viruses is not well understood. Many current microplastic studies are based in the aquatic environment (freshwater, seawater, and wastewater), even though the terrestrial environment is considered both an important sink and source of microplastics. Microplastics co-occur with biological microcontaminants in many terrestrial environments including agricultural soils, where biosolids containing both contaminants are often ap-plied as a soil amendment. Recent research suggests that microplastics in these environments can increase gene persis-tence and flow, which could have unintended downstream consequences for environmental microbiome health and resilience. Antibiotic resistance genes and silencing RNAs bound to microplastics, for example, have the potential to increase resistance and alter gene expression in environmental bacteria, respectively. This review evaluates the sources and pathways of microplastics and biological microcontaminants in the terrestrial environment as well as potential sorption mechanisms that can encourage long-range transport and persistence. Novel sources of biological microcontaminants are considered, and the role of microplastics in promoting the persistence and flow of biological microcontaminants evaluated. Finally, future research directions are suggested to increase understanding of the mech-anisms that drive the fate and transport of microplastic-biological microcontaminant complexes in the terrestrial en-vironment and better inform risk management.","Maguire, Lw; Gardner, Cm",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164439,Science Of The Total Environment
Accelerated Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args) Induced By Non-Antibiotic Conditions: Roles And Mechanisms,"The global spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has wreaked havoc with the treatment efficiency of antibiotics and, ultimately, anti-microbial chemotherapy, and has been conventionally attributed to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, the ancient ARGs have alterative functions in bacterial physiology and thus they could be co-regulated by non-antibiotic conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that many non -antibiotic chemicals such as microplastics, metallic nanoparticles and non-antibiotic drugs, as well as some non-antibiotic conditions, can accelerate the dissemination of ARGs. These results suggested that the role of antibiotics might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of non-antibiotic conditions were possibly ignored. Thus, in an attempt to fully understand the fate and behavior of ARGs in the eco-system, it is urgent to critically highlight the role and mechanisms of non-antibiotic chemicals and related environmental factors in the spread of ARGs. To this end, this timely review assessed the evolution of ARGs, especially its function alteration, summarized the non-antibiotic chemicals promoting the spread of ARGs, evaluated the non -antibiotic conditions related to ARG dissemination and analyzed the molecular mechanisms related to spread of ARGs induced by the non-antibiotic factors. Finally, this review then provided several critical perspectives for future research.","Shi, Xd; Xia, Y; Wei, W; Ni, Bj",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119060,Water Research
Antibiotic Resistance Genes Proliferation Under Anaerobic Degradation Of Polylactic Acid And Polyhydroxy Butyrate Bioplastics,"As the global concern over plastic pollution grows, efforts are underway to find environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics. Bioplastics are being extensively researched and developed as a possible solution. This study compared the impact of two bioplastics, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB), on the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during anaerobic digestion (AD). Both bioplastics (250-500 particles) could be degraded to a certain extent over 79 days, as indicated by higher methane production than the control without bioplastic particles. The PHB 500 reactor showed the highest methane yield along with the highest biodegradation efficiency (91 %) than other reactors amended with PHB and PLA particles. The highest ARG and MGE abundances were also observed in PLA 500, and the lowest ARG abundance was in PLA 250. Conversely, PHB reactors showed a relatively lower ARG abundance than the control. The correlation analysis suggested that most ARGs were positively correlated with PLA and negatively correlated with PHB (except for tetA, tetB, and tetX). Moreover, a correlation between MGEs and ARGs in PLA and PHB reactors was revealed by correlation analysis. These results show that AD responds differently to the different types/levels of bioplastics, which can ultimately influence the behavior of ARG proliferation. Thus, bioplastics may also pose a potential risk for spreading antibiotic resistance. These findings can be used as a basis for setting environmental standards for bioplastics and creating monitoring and control measures to prevent potential negative impacts on public health.","Haffiez, N; Zakaria, Bs; Azizi, Smm; Dhar, Br",10.1016/j.envint.2023.107938,Environment International
Metagenomic Analysis Reveals The Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Sludge Anaerobic Digestion,"Sewage sludge is recognized as both a source and a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Within an anaerobic digestion (AD) system, the presence of microplastics (MPs) has been observed to potentially facilitate the proliferation of these ARGs. Understanding the influence of MPs on microbial behavior and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) within the AD system is crucial for effectively managing the dissemination of ARGs in the environment. This study utilized metagenomic approaches to analyze the dynamics of various types of ARGs and potential microbial mechanisms under exposure to MPs during the AD process. The findings indicated that MPs in the AD process can enhance the proliferation of ARGs, with the extent of this enhancement increasing with the dosage of MPs: polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polylactic acid (PLA) MPs increased the abundance of ARGs in the anaerobic digestion system by up to 29.90%, 18.64%, and 14.15%, respectively. Additionally, the presence of MPs increased the relative abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the AD process. Network correlation analysis further revealed that plasmids represent the predominant category of MGEs involved in the HGT of ARGs. Propionibacterium and Alicycliphilus were identified as the primary potential hosts for these ARGs. The results of gene function annotation indicated that exposure to MPs led to an increased the relative abundance of genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in membrane permeability, ATP synthesis, and the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These genes play crucial roles in influencing the HGT of ARGs.","Li, Zh; Yuan, Dh",10.3390/toxics12120920,Toxics
Metagenomic Insight Into The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Activated Sludge Upon Exposure To Nanoplastics,"Activated sludge is an important reservoir for the co-occurring emerging contaminants including nanoplastics (NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the impacts and potential mechanisms of NPs on the fate of ARGs in activated sludge are not fully understood. Herein, we used metagenomic approach to investigate the responses of ARGs, host bacteria, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and functional genes to polystyrene (PS) NPs at environmentally relevant (0.5 mg/L) and high stress concentrations (50 mg/L) in activated sludge. The results showed that 0.5 and 50 mg/L PS NPs increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the activated sludge by 58.68% and 46.52%, respectively (p < 0.05). Host tracking analysis elucidated that the hosts of ARGs were significantly enriched by PS NPs (p < 0.05), with Proteobacteria being the predominant host bacteria. Additionally, the occurrence of new ARGs hosts and the enrichment of MGEs and functional genes (i.e., genes related to SOS response, cell membrane permeability, and secretion system, etc.) indicated that PS NPs promoted horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. Finally, path modeling analysis revealed that the proliferation of ARGs caused by PS NPs was primarily attributed to the enhancement of HGT and the enrichment of host bacteria. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the spread risk of ARGs in activated sludge under NPs pollution.","Song, J; Huang, Zf; Gao, Yy; Wang, Wg; Guo, G; Duan, Y; Zhou, S; Tang, Zp",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125260,Environmental Pollution
Different Microplastics Distinctively Enriched The Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Sludge Digestion Through Shifting Specific Hosts And Promoting Horizontal Gene Flow,"Both microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are intensively detected in waste activated sludge (WAS). However, the distinctive impacts of different MPs on ARGs emergence, dissemination, and its potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, long-term semi-continuous digesters were performed to examine the profiles of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in response to two different typical MPs (polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) in anaerobic sludge digestion. Metagenomic results show that PE-and PVC-MPs increase ARGs abundance by 14.8% and 23.6% in digester, respectively. ARB are also enriched by PE-and PVC-MPs, Acinetobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. are the dominant ARB. Further exploration reveals that PVC-MPs stimulates the acquisition of ARGs by human pathogen bacteria (HPB) and functional microorganisms (FMs), but PE-MPs doesn't. Network analysis shows that more ARGs tend to co-occur with HBP and FMs after MPs exposure, and more importantly, new bacteria are observed to acquire ARGs possibly via horizontal gene flow (HGF) in MPs-stressed digester. The genes involved in the HGF process, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell membrane permeability, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, and ATP synthesis, are also enhanced by MPs, thereby attributing to the promoted ARGs dissemination. These findings offer advanced insights into the distinctive contribution of MPs to fate, host, dissemination of ARGs in anaerobic sludge digestion.","Luo, Ty; Dai, Xh; Chen, Zj; Wu, L; Wei, W; Xu, Qx; Ni, Bj",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119356,Water Research
Enhanced Propagation Of Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Municipal Wastewater By Microplastics*,"Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global concern as they are abundant in the environment and can act as vectors of various contaminants. However, whether and how MPs can be vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs), remains far from explicit. This study addresses the adsorption of both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and eARGs by four types of MPs in municipal wastewater, and then explores the potential horizontal gene transfer of iARGs and eARGs exposed to MPs. Results indicate that though MPs significantly adsorbed both iARGs and eARGs, eARGs were adsorbed with a significantly higher fold enrichment (2.0-5.0 log versus 2.0-3.3 log) and rate (0.0056 min-1 versus 0.0037 min-1) than iARGs. While all four types of MPs adsorbed ARGs, polypropylene MPs showed the highest adsorption capacity for ARGs. Background constituents such as humic acid and antibiotics significantly inhibited adsorption of iARGs, but not eARGs on MPs. The presence of sodium chloride didn't significantly affect adsorption of iARGs or eARGs. The adsorption of ARGs was well explained by the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) interaction energy profile. Higher eARG adsorption was attributed to a lower energy barrier between MPs and eARGs than that between MPs and iARGs. Exposure to MPs enhanced horizontal gene transfer of both iARGs and eARGs by 1.5 and 2.0 times, respectively. The improved contact potential between donors and recipients, as well as the increased cell permeability of recipients induced the improved horizontal gene transfer by MPs. This study underscores the need to address ARG propagation through adsorption to MPs.","Cheng, Y; Lu, Jr; Fu, Ss; Wang, Sj; Senehi, N; Yuan, Qb",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118284,Environmental Pollution
Photoaged Nanoplastics With Multienzyme-Like Activities Significantly Shape The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Nanoplastics (NPs), identified as emerging pollutants, pose a great risk to environment and global public health, exerting profound influences on the prevalence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite evidence suggesting that nano-sized plastic particles can facilitate the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, it is imperative to explore strategies for inhibiting the transfer of ARGs. Currently, limited information exists regarding the characteristics of environmentally aged NPs and their impact on ARGs propagation. Herein, we investigated the impact of photo-aged NPs on the transfer of ARG-carrying plasmids into Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. Following simulated sunlight irradiation, photo-aged nano-sized polystyrene plastics (PS NPs) exhibited multiple enzyme-like activities, including peroxidase (POD) and oxidase (OXD), leading to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At relatively low concentrations (0.1, 1 mu g/mL), both pristine and aged PS NPs facilitated the transfer of pUC19 and pHSG396 plasmids within E. coli due to moderate ROS production and enhanced cell membrane permeability. Intriguingly, at relatively high concentrations (5, 10 mu g/mL), aged PS NPs significantly suppressed plasmids transformation. The non-unidirectional impact of aged PS NPs involved the overproduction of ROS (center dot OH and center dot O-2(-)) via nanozyme activity, directly degrading ARGs and damaging plasmid structure. Additionally, oxidative damage to bacteria resulted from the presence of much toxic free radicals, causing physical damage to cell membranes, reduction of the SOS response and restriction of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) supply, ultimately leading to inactivation of recipient cells. This study unveils the intrinsic multienzyme-like activity of environmentally aged NPs, highlighting their potential to impede the transfer and dissemination of ARGs.","Chen, Mm; Zhang, Yq; Cheng, Lc; Zhao, Fj; Wang, P",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134884,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Ready-To-Eat Dairy Products As A Source Of Multidrug-Resistant Enterococcus Strains: Phenotypic And Genotypic Characteristics,"The enterococci are ubiquitous bacteria able to colonize the human and animal gastrointestinal tracts and fresh and fermented food products. Their highly plastic genome allows Enterococcus spp. to gain resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections with these organisms difficult to treat. Food-borne enterococci could be carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants. The goal of this work was to study the characteristics of Enterococcus spp. in fermented milk products from Poland and their antibiotic resistance gene profiles. A total of 189 strains were isolated from 182 dairy products out of 320 samples tested. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (53.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (34.4%). Isolates were resistant to streptomycin (29.1%), erythromycin (14.3%), tetracycline (11.6%), rifampicin (8.7%), and tigecycline (8.1%). We also detected 2 vancomycin-resistant and 3 linezolid-resistant strains; however, no vanA or vanB genes were identified. A total of 57 high-level aminoglycoside resistance strains (30.2%) were identified, most of which have the ant(6')-Ia gene, followed by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2 '')-Ia and aph(3 '')-IIIa genes. Resistance to tetracycline was most often conferred by tetM and tetL genes. Macrolide resistance was most frequently encoded by ermB and ermA genes. Conjugative mobile genetic element (transposon Tn916-Tn1545) was identified in 15.3% of the strains, including 96.3% of strains harboring the tetM gene. This study found that enterococci are widely present in retail ready-to-eat dairy products in Poland. Many isolated strains are antibiotic resistant and carry transferable resistance genes, which represent a potential source of transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria to humans.","Chajecka-Wierzchowska, W; Zadernowska, A; García-Solache, M",10.3168/jds.2019-17395,Journal Of Dairy Science
In Treacherous Waters: Detection Of Colistin-Resistant Bacteria In Water And Plastic Litter From A Recreational Estuary,"Colistin resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge and resistant strains have now been reported worldwide. However, the occurrence of such bacteria in aquatic environments is considerably less understood. This study aimed to isolate and characterize colistin-resistant strains from water and plastic litter collected in an urban recreational estuary. Altogether, 64 strains with acquired colistin resistance were identified, mainly Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. From these, 40.6% were positive for at least one mcr variant (1-9), 26.5% harbored, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, 23.4% harbored, sulfonamide resistance genes, and 9.3% harbored, quinolone resistance genes. merA, encoding mercury resistance, was detected in 10.5% of these strains, most of which were also strong biofilm producers. The minimum inhibitory concentration toward colistin was determined for the mcr-positive strains and ranged from 2 to >= 512 mu g ml-1. Our findings suggest that Gram-negative bacteria highly resistant to a last-resort antimicrobial can be found in recreational waters and plastic litter, thereby evidencing the urgency of the One Health approach to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis.","Alves, Gdo; Canellas, Alb; Gallo, Mn; Vinzon, Sb; Laport, Ms",10.1093/lambio/ovae082,Letters In Applied Microbiology
Microplastics Are A Hotspot For Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Progress And Perspective,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics in the environment are of great public concern due to their potential risk to human health. Microplastics can form distinct bacterial communities and absorb pollutants from the surrounding environment, which provide potential hosts and exert possible selection pressure of ARGs. We provide a practical evaluation of the scientific literature regarding this issue. The occurrence and transport of ARGs on microplastics in wastewater treatment plants, aquatic, terrestrial, and air environments were summarized. Selective enrichment of ARGs and antibiotic resistance bacteria on microplastics have been confirmed in different environments. Aggregates may be crucial to understand the behavior and transport of ARGs on microplastics, especially in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. Microplastics could be a carrier of ARGs between the environment and animals. Accumulation of pollutants and dense bacterial communities on microplastics provide favorable conditions for higher transfer rate and evolution of ARGs. More studies are still needed to understand the enrichment, transport, and transfer of ARGs on microplastics and provide a fundamental basis for evaluating their exposure health risk to humans.

"Understanding The Interplay Between Antimicrobial Resistance, Microplastics And Xenobiotic Contaminants: A Leap Towards One Health?","According to the World Health Organization, the two major public health threats in the twenty-first century are antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes. The reason for the global prevalence and the constant increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is owed to the steady rise in overall antimicrobial consumption in several medical, domestic, agricultural, industrial, and veterinary applications, with consequent environmental release. These antibiotic residues may directly contaminate terrestrial and aquatic environments in which antibiotic-resistance genes are also present. Reports suggest that metal contamination is one of the main drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, the abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes is directly connected to the predominance of metal concentrations in the environment. In addition, microplastics have become a threat as emerging contaminants because of their ubiquitous presence, bio-inertness, toughness, danger to aquatic life, and human health implications. In the environment, microplastics and AMR are interconnected through biofilms, where genetic information (e.g., ARGs) is horizontally transferred between bacteria. From this perspective, we tried to summarize what is currently known on this topic and to propose a more effective One Health policy to tackle these threats.","Piergiacomo, F; Brusetti, L; Pagani, L",10.3390/ijerph20010042,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
"Effects Of Polyvinylchloride Microplastics On The Toxicity Of Nanoparticles And Antibiotics To Aerobic Granular Sludge: Nitrogen Removal, Microbial Community And Resistance Genes","Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) have ecological risk to humans and ecosystems. Polyvinylchloride microplastics (PVC MPs), as a representative of microplastics, may often coexist with CuO NPs and CIP in wastewater treatment systems due to their widespread application. However, the co-impact of PVC MPs in wastewater systems contained with CuO NPs and CIP on nitrogen removal and ecological risk is not clear. In this work, PVC MPs co-impacts on the toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP to aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems and potential mechanisms were investigated. 10 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition did not significantly affect the nitrogen removal, but it definitely changed the microbial community structure and enhanced the propagation and horizontal transfer of antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). 100 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition resulted in a raise of CuO NP toxicity to the AGS system, but reduced the co-toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP and ARGs expression. The coimpacts with different PVC MPs concentration influenced Cu2+ concentrations, cell membrane integrity, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents and microbial communities in AGS systems, and lead to a change of nitrogen removal.","Li, Yq; Zhao, Bh; Zhang, Yq; Zhang, Xy; Chen, Xt; Yang, Hs",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117151,Environmental Research

"P, N, And C-Related Functional Genes In Sbr System Promoted Antibiotics Resistance Gene Transmission Under Polystyrene Microplastics Stress","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important sinks of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). Information regarding connections between functional modules of WWTPs and spread of ARGs under MPs stress is still lacking. In this study, correlations between P-, N-, and C-related functional genes and ARGs in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system were evaluated under polystyrene (PS) MPs stress. Total P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in effluent showed no significant changes under 0.5-50 mg L-1 PS MPs stress within 32 cycle treatment periods of SBR, while 0.5 mg L-1 PS MPs affected the N cycling process. PS MPs (0.5-50 mg L-1) promoted the richness and diversity of microbial community in SBR, and the denitrification process was exuberant. PS MPs with a low dosage (0.5-5 mg L-1) enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promoted expression levels of functional genes related to C fixation, C degradation, P cycling, and N cycling. Simultaneously, aac(3)-II, blaTEM-1, and tetW increased by 27.13%, 38.36%, and 9.57% under low dosages of PS MPs stress; more importantly, the total absolute abundance of intI1 nearly doubled. 78.4% of these P-, N-, and C-related functional genes were positively correlated with intI1, thus favoring transmission of ARGs.

Bacterial Community Under The Influence Of Microplastics In Indoor Environment And The Health Hazards Associated With Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Selectively colonized microbial communities and enriched antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in (micro)plastics in aquatic and soil environments make the plastisphere a great health concern. Although microplastics (MPs) are distributed in indoor environments in high abundance, information on the effect of MPs on a microbial community in an indoor environment is lacking. Here, we detected polymers (containing MPs and natural polymers), bacterial communities, and 18 kinds of ARGs in collected indoor dust samples. A significant correlation by Procrustes analysis between bacterial community composition and the abundance of MPs was observed, and correlation tests and redundancy analysis identified specific associations between MP polymers and bacterial taxa, such as polyamide and Actinobacteria. In addition, the abundance of MPs showed a positive correlation with the relative abundance of the ARGs (to 16S RNA), while natural polymers, such as cellulosics, showed positive correlations with the absolute abundance of ARGs and 16S rRNA. Simulated experiments verified that significantly higher bacterial biomasses and ARGs were observed on the surface of cotton, hair, and wool than on MPs, while a higher relative abundance of ARGs was detected on MPs. However, a significantly higher amount of ARG was found on MPs of poly(lactic acid), the biodegradable plastics with the highest yield. In addition to the plastisphere in water and soil environments, MPs in an indoor environment may also affect the bacterial community and specifically enrich ARGs. Moreover, degradable MPs and nondegradable MPs may result in different health hazards due to their distinct effects on bacterial community.","Peng, C; Zhang, Xf; Zhang, Xy; Liu, Cg; Chen, Zy; Sun, Hw; Wang, L",10.1021/acs.est.1c04520,Environmental Science & Technology
Alteration In Microbial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Mediated By Microplastics During Wastewater Ultraviolet Disinfection,"Microplastics (MPs) could be as a vector to colonize microorganisms and antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in surface water. However, little information is known regarding their changes by the presence of MPs in wastewater treatment. Here, the effects of different concentrations and sizes of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on the distribution and removal of microbial communities and ARGs under ultraviolet disinfection of urban sewage have been systematically studied. Results showed that the presence of MPs altered abundance and functions of microorganisms in wastewater, despite different effects on different types of microorganisms. The most abundant ARGs in original disinfection tank sewage was rpoB2 (6.34%). A certain concentration range of MPs can improve the ability of specific types of ARGs in the UV disinfection process. Compared to the system without PSMPs, the content of Deinococcus-Thermus and Bacteroidetes phylum increased, while Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phylum decreased in the presence of MPs. The microbial functions, especially the genetic information processing and metabolism were altered by the presence of PSMPs. In addition, PSMPs altered the content of ARGs, where the contents of OXA-182 and ErmH were increased, while adeF and ANT3-Iic were decreased. PSMPs also decreased the free ARB content in wastewater by providing colonization sites. The UV disinfection efficiency of microorganisms and ARGs was also intervened by PSMPs since they provided colonization sites and increased the water turbidity. The findings indicated that PSMPs altered the distribution and removal of microbial community and ARGs in ultraviolet disinfection of wastewater, highlighting the combined risks.","Yang, Zy; Liu, P; Wei, Hy; Li, H; Li, Jl; Qiu, Xr; Ding, R; Guo, Xt",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153918,Science Of The Total Environment
Plasmid-Mediated Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer Under Environmental Stresses: Insights From Laboratory-Based Studies,"Although clinical settings play a major role in the current global dissemination of antibiotic resistance, once antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes are released into the environment, their fate will be subject to complex ecological processes. One of the processes prevalent in microbial communities - horizontal gene transfer - can largely facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across phylogenetic and ecological boundaries. Especially, plasmid transfer has aroused increasing concern as it has been proved a significant role in promoting ARG dissemination. As a multi-step process, plasmid transfer can be influenced by various factors, among which those stresses caused by environmental pollutants are important elements affecting the plasmid mediated ARG transfer in the environment. In fact, diverse traditional and emerging pollutants are continuously entering the environment nowadays, as evidenced by the global occurrence of pollutants like metals and pharmaceuticals in aquatic and terrestrial systems. It is therefore imperative to understand to what extent and in which way the plasmid mediated ARG dissemination can be influenced by these stresses. Over the past decades, numerous research endeavours have been made to understand the plasmid mediated ARG transfer under various environmental relevant pressures. In this review, progress and challenges of studies on environmental stress regulating plasmid mediated ARG dissemination will be discussed, with specific focus on emerging pollutants like antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, metals and their nanoparticles, disinfectants and disinfection by-products, as well as the emerging particulate matter like microplastics. Despite the previous efforts, we are still lacking insights into the in situ plasmid transfer under environmental stresses, which can be addressed by future studies considering environmental relevant pollution status and multi-species microbial communities. We believe that future development of standardized high-throughput screening platforms will assist in rapidly identifying which pollutants enhance plasmid transfer and also which ones may block such gene transfer processes.","Li, Lg; Zhang, T",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163870,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastic-Mediated Transfer Of Tetracycline Resistance: Unveiling The Role Of Mussels In Marine Ecosystems,"The global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is exacerbated by the mobilization of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) occurring in different environmental niches, including seawater. Marine environments serve as reservoirs for resistant bacteria and ARGs, further complicated by the ubiquity of microplastics (MPs). MPs can adsorb pollutants and promote bacterial biofilm formation, creating conditions favorable to the dissemination of ARGs. This study explores the dynamics of ARG transfer in the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis within a seawater model, focusing on the influence of polyethylene MPs on the mobilization of the Tn916-carrying tetM gene and plasmid-encoded ermB. Experiments revealed that biofilm formation on MPs by Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes facilitated the transfer of the tetM resistance gene, but not the ermB gene. Furthermore, the presence of MPs significantly increased the conjugation frequency of tetM within mussels, indicating that MPs enhance the potential for ARG mobilization in marine environments. These findings highlight the role of MPs and marine organisms in ARG spread, underscoring the ecological and public health implications.","Milani, G; Cortimiglia, C; Daza, Mvb; Greco, E; Bassi, D; Cocconcelli, Ps",10.3390/antibiotics13080727,Antibiotics-Basel
Antibiotic Resistance In Urban Soils: Dynamics And Mitigation Strategies,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a critical global health issue with significant clinical and economic implications. AR occurs when microorganisms develop mechanisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the risk of mortality and healthcare costs. While the connection between antibiotic use in clinical and agricultural settings and the emergence of AR is well-established, the role of urban soils as reservoirs and spreaders of AR is underexplored. This review examines the complex dynamics of AR in urban soils, highlighting the various sources of antibiotics, including domestic wastewater, industrial effluents, urban agricultural practices, but also microplastics and domestic animal excrements. The selective pressure exerted by these anthropogenic sources promotes the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly through horizontal gene transfer, which facilitates the transmission of resistance genes among soil microorganisms in urban environments. About that, the presence of antibiotics in urban soils poses a significant threat to public health by potentially transferring resistance genes to human pathogens through multiple pathways, including direct contact, food consumption, and water ingestion. Furthermore, AR in urban soils disrupts microbial community dynamics, impacting soil fertility, plant growth, and overall environmental quality. Therefore, this review aims to address gaps in understanding AR in urban soils, offering insights into its implications for human health and ecosystem integrity. By identifying these gaps and suggesting evidence-based strategies, this review proposes valid and sustainable solutions to mitigate and counteract the spread of AR in urban environments.","Gentile, A; Di Stasio, L; Oliva, G; Vigliotta, G; Cicatelli, A; Guarino, F; Nissim, Wg; Labra, M; Castiglione, S",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120120,Environmental Research
Microplastics Affect The Ammonia Oxidation Performance Of Aerobic Granular Sludge And Enrich The Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as emerging pollutants, are frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants, and their threats to the environment have received extensive attentions. However, the effects of MPs on the nitrification of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and the spread patterns of intracellular and extracellular ARGs (iARGs and eARGs) in AGS were still unknown. In this study, the responses of AGS to the exposure of 1, 10 and 100 mg/L of typical MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE)) and tetracycline were focused on in 3 L nitrifying sequencing batch reactors. 10 mg/L MPs decreased the nitrification function, but nitrification could recover. Furthermore, MPs inhibited ammonia oxidizing bacteria and enriched nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, leading partial nitrification to losing stability. PVC, PA and PS stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and reactive oxygen species. PE had less negative effect on AGS than PVC, PA and PS. The abundances of iARGs and eARGs (tetW, tetE and intI1) increased significantly and the intracellular and extracellular microbial communities obviously shifted in AGS system under MPs stress. Potential pathogenic bacteria might be the common hosts of iARGs and eARGs in AGS system and were enriched in AGS and MPs biofilms.","Wang, Zq; Gao, Jf; Dai, Hh; Zhao, Yf; Li, Dc; Duan, Wj; Guo, Y",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124981,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Size-Dependent Promotion Of Micro(Nano)Plastics On The Horizontal Gene Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Constructed Wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been identified as significant sources of micro(nano)plastics (MPs/NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. However, little is known about the impact of MPs/ NPs exposure on horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs and shaping the corresponding ARG hosts' community. Herein, the contribution of polystyrene (PS) particles (control, 4 mm, 100 mu m, and 100 nm) to ARG transfer was investigated by adding an engineered fluorescent Escherichia coli harboring RP4 plasmid-encoded ARGs into CWs. It was found MPs/NPs significantly promoted ARG transfer in a size-dependent manner in each CW medium (p < 0.05). The 100 mu m-sized PS exhibited the most significant promotion of ARG transfer (p < 0.05), whereas 100 nm-sized PS induced limited promotion due to its inhibitory activity on microbes. The altered RP4-carrying bacterial communities suggested that MPs/NPs, especially 100 mu m-PS, could recruit pathogenic and nitrifying bacteria to acquire ARGs. The increased sharing of RP4-carrying core bacteria in CW medium further suggested that ARGs can spread into CW microbiome using MPs/NPs as carriers. Overall, our results highlight the high risks of ARG dissemination induced by MPs/NPs exposure and emphasize the need for better control of plastic disposal to prevent the potential health threats.","Zhao, Yh; Hu, Z; Xie, Hj; Wu, Hm; Wang, Yc; Xu, H; Liang, S; Zhang, J",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120520,Water Research
Fates Of Extracellular And Intracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Activated Sludge And Plastisphere Under Sulfadiazine Pressure,"Microplastics, antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) represent prominent emerging contaminants that can potentially hinder the efficacy of biological wastewater treatment and pose health risks. Plastisphere as a distinct ecological niche for microorganisms, acts as a repository for ARGs and potential pathogenic bacteria. Nonetheless, the spread pattern of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and intracellular ARGs (iARGs) in plastisphere under antibiotic exposure was not yet known. This study aimed to investigate disparities in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, extracellular and intracellular microbial community structures, as well as the transmission of eARGs and iARGs between activated sludge and plastisphere in an anaerobic/anoxic/oxic system under sulfadiazine (SDZ) exposure. SDZ was found to enhance EPS production in activated sludge and plastisphere. Interestingly, as SDZ removal efficiency increased, EPS content decreased in activated sludge and plastisphere collected from oxic zone, and continued to increase in plastisphere samples collected from anaerobic and anoxic zones. There were significant differences in microbial community structure between activated sludge and plastisphere, and the DNA fragments of potential pathogenic bacteria were detected in extracellular samples. SDZ exhibited a promoting effect on the propagation of eARGs, which were more abundant in the plastisphere than in activated sludge, thus heightening the risk of ARGs dissemination. Extracellular mobile genetic elements played a pivotal role in driving the spread of eARGs, while the microbial community induced the changes of iARGs. Potential pathogenic bacteria emerged as potential hosts for ARGs and mobile genetic elements within activated sludge and plastisphere, leading to more serious environmental threats.","Wang, Zq; Gao, Jf; Zhao, Yf; Guo, Y; Zhang, Y; Yuan, Yk; Zhao, My; Zeng, Lq",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120752,Water Research
"Review Of Emerging Contaminants In Green Stormwater Infrastructure: Antibiotic Resistance Genes, Microplastics, Tire Wear Particles, Pfas, And Temperature","Green stormwater infrastructure is a growing management approach to capturing, infiltrating, and treating runoff at the source. However, there are several emerging contaminants for which green stormwater infrastructure has not been explicitly designed to mitigate and for which removal mechanisms are not yet well defined. This is an issue, as there is a growing understanding of the impact of emerging contaminants on human and environmental health. This paper presents a review of five emerging contaminants - antibiotic resistance genes, microplastics, tire wear particles, PFAS, and temperature - and seeks to improve our understanding of how green stormwater infrastructure is impacted by and can be designed to mitigate these emerging contaminants. To do so, we present a review of the source and transport of these contaminants to green stormwater infrastructure, specific treatment mechanisms within green infrastructure, and design considerations of green stormwater infrastructure that could lead to their removal. In addition, common removal mechanisms across these contaminants and limitations of green infrastructure for contaminant mitigation are discussed. Finally, we present future research directions that can help to advance the use of green infrastructure as a first line of defense for downstream water bodies against emerging contaminants of concern.","Bodus, B; O'Malley, K; Dieter, G; Gunawardana, C; Mcdonald, W",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167195,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastic And Antibiotic Proliferated The Colonization Of Specific Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Phycosphere Of Chlorella Pyrenoidosa,"Despite that the phycosphere was an important niche for the proliferation of various bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the factors that affect the colonization of bacteria and ARGs in the phycosphere are still poorly understood. In this study, sterile C. pyrenoidosa co-cultured with bacteria from different sources and provided with polylactic acid microplastic (PLA MPs) and florfenicol (FF) was examined. Results showed that bacteria promoted the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and increased its chlorophyll contents. PLA MPs and FF also showed positive effects on C. pyrenoidosa due to the Hormesis effect. The occurrence of bacteria in the phy-cosphere was significantly affected by their sources and the addition of PLA MPs and FF. However, the core microbiota of the phycosphere in each group was similar. Additionally, PLA MPs and FF proliferated the abundance of phenicol-related ARGs (especially floR) and mobile genetic elements in the phycosphere. Notably, PLA MPs and FF enhanced the abundance of Flavobacterium, a potential host of ARGs. Our results highlighted the important roles of bacteria in microalgae and demonstrated exogenous pollutants could promote the spread of ARGs between surrounding environments and the phycosphere, which provide new insights into the occurrence and spread of ARGs in the phycosphere.","Jia, J; Liu, Q; Wu, Cx",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131618,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Aged Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Review Of Aging Effects On Their Interactions,"Background: Microplastic aging affects the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on microplastics, yet no review presents the effects of microplastic aging on the associated ARGs. Objectives: This review, therefore, aims to discuss the effects of different types of microplastic aging, as well as the other pollutants on or around microplastics and the chemicals leached from microplastics, on the associated ARGs. Results: It highlights that microplastic photoaging generally results in higher sorption of antibiotics and ARGs due to increased microplastic surface area and functional group changes. Photoaging produces reactive oxygen species, facilitating ARG transfer by increasing bacterial cell membrane permeability. Reactive oxygen species can interact with biofilms, suggesting combined effects of microplastic aging on ARGs. The effects of mechanical aging were deduced from studies showing larger microplastics anchoring more ARGs due to rough surfaces. Smaller microplastics from aging penetrate deeper and smaller places and transport ARGs to these places. High temperatures are likely to reduce biofilm mass and ARGs, but the variation of ARGs on microplastics subjected to thermal aging remains unknown due to limited studies. Biotic aging results in biofilm formation on microplastics, and biofilms, often with unique microbial structures, invariably enrich ARGs. Higher oxidative stress promotes ARG transfer in the biofilms due to higher cell membrane permeability. Other environmental pollutants, particularly heavy metals, antibacterial, chlorination by-products, and other functional genes, could increase microplastic-associated ARGs, as do microplastic additives like phthalates and bisphenols. Conclusions: This review provides insights into the environmental fate of co-existing microplastics and ARGs under the influences of aging. Further studies could examine the effects of mechanical and thermal MP aging on their interactions with ARGs.","Tang, Khd; Li, Rh",10.3390/antibiotics13100941,Antibiotics-Basel
Interaction Between Microplastic Biofilm Formation And Antibiotics: Effect Of Microplastic Biofilm And Its Driving Mechanisms On Antibiotic Resistance Gene,"As two pollutants with similar transport pathways, microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics (ATs) inevitably co-exist in water environments, and their interaction has become a topic of intense research interest for scholars over the past few years. This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the current interaction between MPs and ATs, in particular, the role played by biofilm developed MPs (microplastic biofilm). A summary of the formation process of microplastic biofilm and its unique microbial community structure is presented in the paper. The formation of microplastic biofilm can enhance the adsorption mechanisms of ATs on primary MPs. Moreover, microplastic biofilm system is a diverse and vast reservoir of genetic material, and this paper reviews the mechanisms by which microplastics with biofilm drive the production of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the processes that selectively enrich for more ARGs. Meanwhile, the enrichment of ARGs may lead to the development of microbial resistance and the gradual loss of the antimicrobial effect of ATs. The transfer pathways of ARGs affected by microplastic biofilm are outlined, and ARGs dependent transfer of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) is mainly through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, the ecological implications of the interaction between microplastic biofilm and ATs and perspectives for future research are reviewed. This review contributes to a new insight into the aquatic ecological environmental risks and the fate of contaminants (MPs, ATs), and is of great significance for controlling the combined pollution of these two pollutants.","Zheng, Zj; Huang, Y; Liu, La; Wang, L; Tang, Jc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132099,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Life, Death And Rebirth Of Avirulence Effectors In A Fungal Pathogen Of Brassica Crops, Leptosphaeria Maculans","In agricultural systems, major (R) genes for resistance in plants exert strong selection pressure on cognate/ corresponding avirulence effector genes of phytopathogens. However, a complex interplay often exists between trade- offs linked to effector function and the need to escape R gene recognition. Here, using the Leptosphaeria maculans- oilseed rape pathosystem we review evolution of effectors submitted to multiple resistance gene selection. Characteristics of this pathosystem include a crop in which resistance genes have been deployed intensively resulting in ` boom and bust ' cycles; a fungal pathogen with a high adaptive potential in which seven avirulence genes are cloned and for which population surveys have been coupled with molecular analysis of events responsible for virulence. The mode of evolution of avirulence genes, all located in dispensable parts of the ' two-speed ' genome, is a highly dynamic gene- specific process. In some instances, avirulence genes are readily deleted under selection. However, others, even when located in the most plastic genome regions, undergo only limited point mutations or their avirulence phenotype is ` camouflaged ' by another avirulence gene. Thus, while hundreds of effector genes are present, some effectors are likely to have an important and nonredundant function, suggesting functional redundancy and dispensability of effectors might not be the rule.","Rouxel, T; Balesdent, Mh",10.1111/nph.14411,New Phytologist
Mobile Genetic Elements Harboring Antibiotic Resistance Determinants In Acinetobacter Baumannii Isolates From Bolivia,"Using a combination of short- and long-read DNA sequencing, we have investigated the location of antibiotic resistance genes and characterized mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three clinical multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolates, collected in Bolivia, clustered separately with three different international clonal lineages. We found a diverse array of transposons, plasmids and resistance islands related to different insertion sequence (IS) elements, which were located in both the chromosome and in plasmids, which conferred resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including carbapenems. Carbapenem resistance might be caused by a Tn2008 carrying the bla(OXA-23) gene. Some plasmids were shared between the isolates. Larger plasmids were less conserved than smaller ones and they shared some homologous regions, while others were more diverse, suggesting that these big plasmids are more plastic than the smaller ones. The genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance in Bolivia has not been deeply studied until now, and the mobilome of these A. baumannii isolates, combined with their multi-drug resistant phenotype, mirror the transfer and prevalence of MGEs contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide and require special attention. These findings could be useful to understand the antimicrobial resistance genetics of A. baumannii in Bolivia and the difficulty in tackling these infections.","Cerezales, M; Xanthopoulou, K; Wille, J; Krut, O; Seifert, H; Gallego, L; Higgins, Pg",10.3389/fmicb.2020.00919,Frontiers In Microbiology
Tire Wear Particles Enhance Horizontal Gene Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Microplastics (MPs) have introduced new surfaces for biofilm development and gene exchange among bacteria. We investigated Tire Wear Particles (TWPs) for their involvement in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), particularly in relation to associated metals in the matrices of TWPs. We employed red-fluorescently tagged E. coli strain as a donor with green-fluorescently tagged, broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5, resistant to trimethoprim. As a recipient, we utilized Pseudomonas sp. and a natural lake microbial community. HGT activity on TWPs was determined and compared with that on polystyrene (PS) (with and without metals), and chitosan, which was used as a natural surface. Exposure to TWPs significantly enhanced HGT frequency of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) from donor to recipient compared to PS and chitosan, and metals of TWPs further promoted HGT. HGT frequency on TWPs with Pseudomonas sp. was found to be 10-3 at 30 degrees C. in the lake community, it was similarly high already at 25 degrees C suggesting a higher permissiveness of the natural microbial community towards ARG at lower temperatures. This study sheds light on the potential impact of TWPs in promoting HGT, forming the basis for health risk assessments of TWPs and more generally of MP pollution in various aquatic ecosystems.","Jaffer, Yd; Monikh, Fa; Uli, K; Grossart, Hp",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120187,Environmental Research
Effects Comparison Between The Secondary Nanoplastics Released From Biodegradable And Conventional Plastics On The Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Between Bacteria,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have caused widespread concern because of their potential harm to environmental safety and human health. As substitutes for conventional plastics, the toxic effects of short-term degradation products of biodegradable plastics (polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)) on bacteria and their impact on ARGs transfer were the focus of this study. After 60 days of degradation, more secondary nanoplastics were released from the biodegradable plastics PLA and PHA than that from the conventional plastics polystyrene (PS). All kinds of nanoplastics, no matter released from biodegradable plastics or conventional plastics, had no significant toxicity to bacteria. Nanoplastic particles from biodegradable plastics could significantly increase the transfer efficiency of ARGs. Although the amount of secondary nanoplastics produced by PHA microplastics was much higher than that of PLA, the transfer frequency after exposure to PLA was much higher, which may be due to the agglomeration of PHA nanoplastics caused by plastic instability in solution. After exposure to the 60 d PLA nanoplastics, the transfer frequency was the highest, which was approximately 28 times higher than that of control. The biodegradable nanoplastics significantly enhanced the expression of the outer membrane pore protein genes ompA and ompC, which could increase cell membrane permeability. The expression levels of trfAp and trbBp were increased by repressed major global regulatory genes korA, korB, and trbA, which eventually led to an increase in conjugative transfer frequency. This study provides important insights into the evaluation of the environmental and health risks caused by secondary nanoplastics released from biodegradable plastics.","Liu, Xm; Wang, Xl; Wang, Rj; Guo, Ss; Ahmad, S; Song, Yh; Gao, Pk; Chen, Jf; Liu, Cc; Ding, N",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120680,Environmental Pollution
Understanding The Mechanism Of Microplastic-Associated Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Aquatic Ecosystems: Insights From Metagenomic Analyses And Machine Learning,"The pervasive presence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic systems facilitates the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), thereby posing risks to ecosystems and human well-being. However, owing to variations in environmental backgrounds and the limited scope of research subjects, studies on ARGs in MPs lack unified conclusions, particularly regarding whether different types of MPs selectively promote ARG enrichment. Analysing large-scale datasets can better encompass broad spatiotemporal scales and diverse samples, facilitating a more extensive exploration of the complex ecological relationships between MPs and ARGs. The present study integrated existing metagenomic datasets to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and comparative analysis of resistance groups across various MPs. In addition, we endeavoured to elucidate potential associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa, as well as MP structural features, using machine learning (ML) methods. The findings of our research highlight the pivotal role of MP type in shaping plastispheres, accounting for 9.56 % of the biotic variation (Adonis index) and explaining 18.59 % of the ARG variance. Compared to conventional MPs, biodegradable MPs, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polylactic acid (PLA), exhibit lower species uniformity and diversity but pose a higher risk of ARG occurrence. These ML approaches effectively forecasted ARG abundance by using the bacterial taxa and molecular structure descriptors (MDs) of MPs (average R2 tra = 0.882, R2 test = 0.759). Feature analysis showed that MDs associated with lipophilicity, solubility, toxicity, and surface potential significantly influenced the relative abundance of ARGs in the plastispheres. The interpretable multiple linear regression (MLR) model, particularly notable, elucidated a linear relationship between bacterial genera and ARGs, offering promise for identifying potential ARG hosts. This study offers novel insights into ARG dynamics and ecological risks within aquatic plastispheres, highlighting the importance of comprehensive MP monitoring initiatives.","Zhu, Ty; Li, Sy; Tao, Cc; Chen, Wx; Chen, M; Zong, Zy; Wang, Yj; Li, Y; Yan, Bp",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122570,Water Research
Dynamic Evolution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Plastisphere In The Vertical Profile Of Urban Rivers,"Microplastics (MPs) can vertically transport in the aquatic environment due to their aging and biofouling, forming distinct plastisphere in different water layers. However, even though MPs have been regarded as hot -spots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), little is known about the propagation and transfer of ARGs in plastisphere in waters, especially in the vertical profile. Therefore, this study investigated the dynamic responses and evolution of ARGs in different plastisphere distributed vertically in an urbanized river. The biofilm biomass in the polylactic acid (PLA) plastisphere was relatively higher than that in the polyethylene terephthalate (PET), showing depth-decay variations. The ARGs abundance in plastisphere were much higher than that in the sur-rounding waters, especially for the PLA. In the vertical profiles, the ARGs abundance in the PET plastisphere increased with water depths, while the highest abundance of ARGs in the PLA mostly appeared at intermediate waters. In the temporal dynamic, the ARGs abundance in plastisphere increased and then decreased, which may be dominated by the MP types at the initial periods. After long-term exposure, the influences of water depths seemed to be strengthened, especially in the PET plastisphere. Compared with surface waters, the microbiota attached in plastisphere in deep waters showed high species richness, strong diversity, and complex interactions, which was basically consistent with the changes of nutrient contents in different water layers. These vertical variations in microbiota and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) may be responsible for the propagation of ARGs in plas-tisphere in deep waters. The host bacteria for ARGs in plastisphere was also developed as water depth increased, leading to an enrichment of ARGs in deep waters. In addition, the abundance of ARGs in plastisphere in bottom waters was positively correlated with the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of intI1 and tnpA05, indicative of a frequent horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. Overall, water depth played a critical role in the propagation of ARGs in plastisphere, which should not be ignored in a long time series. This study provides new insights into the dynamic evolution of ARGs propagation in plastisphere under increasing global MPs pollution, especially in the vertical profile.","Chen, Yf; Yan, Zh; Zhou, Yx; Zhang, Y; Jiang, Rr; Wang, M; Yuan, Sy; Lu, Gh",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120946,Water Research
Microplastics Exacerbated Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Ultraviolet Disinfection: Highlighting Difference Between Conventional And Biodegradable Ones,"Microplastics (MPs) have been confirmed as a hotspot for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in wastewater. However, the impact of MPs on the transfer of ARGs in wastewater treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the roles and mechanisms of conventional (polystyrene, PS) and biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA) MPs in the conjugative transfer of ARGs during ultraviolet disinfection. The results showed that MPs significantly facilitated the conjugative transfer of ARGs compared with individual ultraviolet disinfection, and PSMPs exhibited higher facilitation than PLAMPs. The facilitation effects were attributed to light shielding and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nanoplastics from ultraviolet irradiation of MPs. The light shielding of MPs protected the bacteria and ARGs from ultraviolet inactivation. More importantly, ROS and nanoplastics generated from irradiated MPs induced intracellular oxidative stress on bacteria and further increased the cell membrane permeability and intercellular contact, ultimately enhancing the ARG exchange. The greater fragmentation of PSMPs than PLAMPs resulted in a higher intracellular oxidative stress and a stronger enhancement. This study highlights the concerns of conventional and biodegradable MPs associated with the transfer of ARGs during wastewater treatment, which provides new insights into the combined risks of MPs and ARGs in the environment.","Zhang, Xr; Wang, J; Yang, Zy; Zhang, Zx; Wang, Mj; Zhang, Ts; Chen, Yq; Wu, Xw; Liu, P; Jia, Hz",10.1021/acs.est.4c10991,Environmental Science & Technology
Characteristics Of Tetracycline Antibiotic Resistance Gene Enrichment And Migration In Soil-Plant System,"Tetracycline Resistance Genes (TRGs) have received widespread attention in recent years, as they are a novel environmental pollutant that can rapidly accumulate and migrate in soil plant systems through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), posing a potential threat to food safety and public health. This article systematically reviews the pollution sources, enrichment, and migration characteristics of TRGs in soil. The main sources of TRGs include livestock manure and contaminated wastewater, especially in intensive farming environments where TRGs pollution is more severe. In soil, TRGs diffuse horizontally between bacteria and migrate to plant tissues through mechanisms such as plasmid conjugation, integron mediation, and phage transduction. The migration of TRGs is not limited to the soil interior, and increasing evidence suggests that they can also enter the plant system through plant root absorption and the HGT pathway of endophytic bacteria, ultimately accumulating in plant roots, stems, leaves, fruits, and other parts. This process has a direct impact on human health, especially when TRGs are found in crops such as vegetables, which may be transmitted to the human body through the food chain. In addition, this article also deeply analyzed various factors that affect the migration of TRGs, including the residual level of tetracycline in soil, the type and concentration of microorganisms, heavy metal pollution, and the presence of new pollutants such as microplastics. These factors significantly affect the enrichment rate and migration mode of TRGs in soil. In addition, two technologies that can effectively eliminate TRGs in livestock breeding environments were introduced, providing reference for healthy agricultural production. The article concludes by summarizing the shortcomings of current research on TRGs, particularly the limited understanding of TRG migration pathways and their impact mechanisms. Future research should focus on revealing the migration mechanisms of TRGs in soil plant systems and developing effective control and governance measures to reduce the environmental transmission risks of TRGs and ensure the safety of ecosystems and human health.","Wang, L; Yu, La; Cai, By",10.1007/s10653-024-02239-1,Environmental Geochemistry And Health
"Freshwater Plastisphere: A Review On Biodiversity, Risks, And Biodegradation Potential With Implications For The Aquatic Ecosystem Health","The plastisphere, a unique microbial biofilm community colonizing plastic debris and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments, has attracted increasing attention owing to its ecological and public health implications.

Discarded Masks As Hotspots Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Covid-19 Pandemic,"The demand for facial masks remains high. However, little is known about discarded masks as a potential refuge for contaminants and to facilitate enrichment and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment. We address this issue by conducting an in-situ time-series experiment to investigate the dynamic changes of ARGs, bacteria and protozoa associated with discarded masks. Masks were incubated in an estuary for 30 days. The relative abundance of ARGs in masks increased after day 7 but levelled off after 14 days. The absolute abundance of ARGs at 30 days was 1.29 x 1012 and 1.07 x 1012 copies for carbon and surgical masks, respectively. According to normalized stochasticity ratio analysis, the assembly of bacterial and protistan communities was determined by stochastic (NST = 62%) and deterministic (NST = 40%) processes respectively. A network analysis highlighted potential interactions between bacteria and protozoa, which was further confirmed by culture-dependent assays, that showed masks shelter and enrich microbial communities. An antibiotic susceptibility test suggested that antibiotic resistant pathogens co-exist within protozoa. This study provides an insight into the spread of ARGs through discarded masks and highlights the importance of managing discarded masks with the potential ecological risk of mask contamination.","Zhou, Syd; Lin, Cs; Yang, K; Yang, Ly; Yang, Xr; Huang, Fy; Neilson, R; Su, Jq; Zhu, Yg",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127774,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Insight Into Effects Of Polyethylene Microplastics In Anaerobic Digestion Systems Of Waste Activated Sludge: Interactions Of Digestion Performance, Microbial Communities And Antibiotic Resistance Genes","The environmental risks of microplastics (MPs) have raised an increasing concern. However, the effects of MPs in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems of waste activated sludge (WAS), especially on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), have not been clearly understood. Herein, the variation and interaction of digestion performance, microbial communities and ARGs during AD process of WAS in the presence of polyethylene (PE) MPs with two sizes, PE MPs-180 mu m and PE MPs-1mm, were investigated. The results showed that the presence of PE MPs, especially PE MPs-1mm, led to the increased hydrolysis of soluble polysaccharides and proteins and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The methane production decreased by 6.1% and 13.8% in the presence of PE MPs-180 mu m and PE MPs-1mm, respectively. Together with this process, hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens were enriched, and methanogens participating in acetoclastic methanogenesis were reduced. Meanwhile, ARGs were enriched obviously by the presence of PE MPs, the abundances of which in PE MPs-180 mu m and PE MPs-1mm groups were 1.2-3.0 times and 1.5-4.0 times higher than that in the control by the end of AD. That was associated with different co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial taxa and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria caused by the presence of PE MPs. Together these results suggested the adverse effects of PE MPs on performance and ARGs removal during AD process of WAS through inducing the changes of microbial populations.","Shi, Jh; Dang, Ql; Zhang, Cy; Zhao, Xy",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119859,Environmental Pollution
Deterioration Of Sludge Characteristics And Promotion Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Spread With The Co-Existing Of Polyvinylchloride Microplastics And Tetracycline In The Sequencing Batch Reactor,"With the continuous increase in microplastics (MPs) and tetracycline (TC) entering wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along with sewage, the co-existence of MPs and TC in the biological treatment of wastewater has attracted extensive attention. This study investigated the effect of 1 mg/L polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs and 100 ng/L TC co-existing on sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) (S2) treating phenol wastewater in contrast to the control with TC alone (S1). The phenol removal efficiency was significantly inhibited by the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC. Sludge characteristics were also distinctively influenced. The decreased zone sludge velocity (ZSV) and increased sludge volume index (SVI) indicated that the combined effect of PVC MPs and TC deteriorated sludge settleability, which had positive and negative linear correlations with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content and the protein (PN)/polysaccharide (PS) ratio, respectively. Moreover, the decreased and increased relative abundances of potential phenol-degraders and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) carriers may elucidate the inhibition of phenol removal and promotion of ARGs propagation with the co-occurrence of PVC MPs and TC. In addition, the enhanced potential ARGs hosts, loss of the EPS protective effect, and increased membrane permeability induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) jointly promoted ARGs dissemination in the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC. Notably, the co-occurrence of ARGs and mobile genetic element (MGEs) indicated that the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC promoted the spread of some transposase-associated ARGs mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).","Liu, Qw; Li, Yx; Sun, Ya; Xie, Kp; Zeng, Qz; Hao, Ym; Yang, Q; Pu, Yh; Shi, Sn; Gong, Z",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167544,Science Of The Total Environment
Soil Plastispheres As Hotpots Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potential Pathogens,"In the Anthropocene, increasing pervasive plastic pollution is creating a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere. How the plastisphere affects microbial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is an issue of global concern. Although this has been studied in aquatic ecosystems, our understanding of plastisphere microbiota in soil ecosystems remains poor. Here, we investigated plastisphere microbiota and ARGs of four types of microplastics (MPs) from diverse soil environments, and revealed effects of manure, temperature, and moisture on them. Our results showed that the MPs select for microbial communities in the plastisphere, and that these plastisphere communities are involved in diverse metabolic pathways, indicating that they could drive diverse ecological processes in the soil ecosystem. The relationship within plastisphere bacterial zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) was predominantly positive, and neutral processes appeared to dominate community assembly. However, deterministic processes were more important in explaining the variance in ARGs in plastispheres. A range of potential pathogens and ARGs were detected in the plastisphere, which were enriched compared to the soil but varied across MPs and soil types. We further found that the addition of manure and elevation of soil temperature and moisture all enhance ARGs in plastispheres, and potential pathogens increase with soil moisture. These results suggested that plastispheres are habitats in which an increased potential pathogen abundance is spatially co-located with an increased abundance of ARGs under global change. Our findings provided new insights into the community ecology of the microbiome and antibiotic resistome of the soil plastisphere.","Zhu, D; Ma, J; Li, G; Rillig, Mc; Zhu, Yg",10.1038/s41396-021-01103-9,Isme Journal
Microplastic Biofilm: An Important Microniche That May Accelerate The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Via Natural Transformation,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms provide a specific microniche for microbial life and are a potential hotspot for the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Nevertheless, the acquisition of ARGs in MP biofilms via natural transformation mediated by extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been rarely explored. This study demonstrated that MP biofilms promoted the natural transformation of extracellular ARGs at the single-cell and multi-species levels, compared to natural substrate (NS) biofilms and bacterioplankton. The transformation frequency on MP biofilms was up to 1000-fold compare to that on NS. The small MPs and aged MPs enhanced the ARG transformation frequencies up to 77.16-fold and 32.05-fold, respectively, compared with the large MPs and pristine MPs. The transformation frequencies on MP biofilms were significantly positively correlated with the bacterial density and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MPs significantly increased the expression of the biofilm formation related genes (motA and pgaA) and DNA uptake related genes (pilX and comA) compared to NS and bacterioplankton. The more transformants colonized on MPs contributed to the enhanced transformation frequencies at the community-wide level. Overall, eDNA-mediated transformation in MP biofilms may be an important path of ARG spread, which was promoted by heterogeneous biofilm.","Wang, Hx; Xu, Kw; Wang, J; Feng, C; Chen, Yh; Shi, Jh; Ding, Y; Deng, Cx; Liu, Xw",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132085,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastic And Antibiotics In Waters: Interactions And Environmental Risks,"Antibiotics (ATs) are ubiquitously detected in natural waters worldwide, and their tendency to co-migrate with microplastics (MPs) post-adsorption leads to heightened environmental risk. Research on the adsorption of ATs on MPs and their subsequent effects on the environmental risks is gaining significant attention globally. This adsorption process predominantly occurs through hydrophobic forces, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions and is influenced by various environmental factors. The interaction between MPs and ATs exhibited varying degrees of efficiency across different pH levels and ionic strengths. Furthermore, this paper outlines the environmental risks associated with the co-presence of MPs and ATs in aquatic environments, emphasizing the potential effect of MPs on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and related environmental risks. The potential hazards posed by MPs and ATs in aquatic systems warrant serious consideration. Future research should concentrate on the adsorption of ATs/ARGs on MPs under real environmental conditions, horizontal gene transfer on MPs, as well as biofilm formation and agglomeration behavior on MPs that needs to be emphasized.","Guo, Jy; Jin, Xb; Zhou, Y; Gao, Bw; Li, Y; Zhou, Yb",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123125,Journal Of Environmental Management
Are Microplastics In Aquaculture An Undeniable Driver In Accelerating The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes?,"Aquaculture products have been a key source of protein in the human food supply. Contamination by microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) directly affects food quality and safety. Plastic fishing gear and the long-term misuse of antibiotics result in the persistent residue, migration, and spread of microplastics and ARGs in the aquaculture environment, causing in ecological imbalance and endangering human security. Microplastics can act as petri dishes for the reproduction, communication, and spread of ARGs, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the global issues surrounding microplastics and ARGs. Aquaculture has become an important source of microplastics and ARGs in natural waters. Accordingly, this paper mainly discusses the contribution of aquaculture to the presence of microplastics and ARGs in aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics and ARGs can (1) affect the production and quality of aquatic products; (2) influence the development and reproduction of aquatic organisms; and (3) accelerate the spread of resistant bacteria. How to eliminate microplastics and ARGs and block their transmission has become a worldwide problem. Actually, further research is required to understand the scale and scope of these effects.","Jin, Rx; Zhang, Jh; Zhao, Yf; Liu, Sw; Shen, Mc",10.1007/s11356-023-30412-z,Environmental Science And Pollution Research
Microplastics Act As Vectors For Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Landfill Leachate: The Enhanced Roles Of The Long-Term Aging Process,"Microplastics (MPs) are found to be ubiquitous and serve as vectors for other contaminants, and the inevitable aging process changes MP properties and fates. However, whether the MPs in aging process affects the fates of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in aquatic environments is poorly understood. Herein, the physicochemical property alteration of MPs being aged in landfill leachate, an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs, was investigated, and microbial community evolution and ARGs occurrence of MP surface during the aging process were analyzed. Aging process remarkably altered surface properties, including increasing specific surface areas, causing the formation of oxygen-containing groups, and changing surface morphology, which further increased the probability of microbial colonization. The bacterial assemblage on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential compared to leachate. ARGs quantification results suggested that MPs exhibited selective enrichment for ARGs in a ratio of 5.7-10(3) folds, and the aging process enhanced the enrichment potential. Further co-occurrence networks suggested that the existence of non-random, closer and more stable ARGs-bacterial taxa relations on MP surface affected the ARG transmission. The study of ARG partitioning on MPs indicated that extracellular DNA was a nonnegligible reservoir of ARGs attached on MP surface, and that biofilm bacterial community influenced ARGs partitioning pattern during the aging process. This study confirmed that the aging process could enhance the potential of MPs as vectors for ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding of MP behavior and risk in natural environments.

Polyethylene Terephthalate Microplastic Fibers Increase The Release Of Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Sewage Sludge Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastic fibers (MFs), as the most frequently detected microplastic shape in sewage sludge, have posed emerging concern for sludge treatment and disposal. However, the effect of MFs on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs) during sludge treatment remains far from explicit. Therefore, this study investigated the potential impact of MFs on eARGs during sludge anaerobic digestion (AD), a commonly used sludge treatment method, through long-term operation. The qPCR results showed that both absolute and relative abundances of eARGs increased with the MFs exposure during sludge AD. The average absolute and relative abundances of eight tested eARGs in the AD reactor with the highest MFs dosage (170 items/gTS) were 1.70 and 2.15 times higher than those in the control AD reactor. The metagenomics results further comfirmed the increase of eARGs abundance during sludge anaerobic digestion after MFs exposure and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity. The identification of the potential hosts of eARGs suggested the host numbers of eARGs also increased with MFs exposure, which may suggest enhanced horizonal transformation as a result of increased eARGs. Further exploring the mechansims showed that the genes involved in type IV secretion system was upregulated after MFs exposure, suggesting the active release of eARGs was enhanced with MFs exposure. In contrast, the MFs may not affect the passive release of eARGs as its impact on cell membrance damage was insignificant. The enhanced eARGs in sludge AD process may further accelerate the transport of ARGs in environment, which should be considered during sludge treatment and disposal.","Zhang, L; Sun, J; Zhang, Zs; Peng, Zt; Dai, Xh; Ni, Bj",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118426,Water Research
Low-Density Polyethylene Enhances The Disturbance Of Microbiome And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Transfer In Soil-Earthworm System Induced By Pyraclostrobin,"Non -antibiotic chemicals in farmlands, including microplastics (MPs) and pesticides, have the potential to influence the soil microbiome and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite this, there is limited understanding of the combined effects of MPs and pesticides on microbial communities and ARGs transmission in soil ecosystems. In this study, we observed that low -density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastic enhance the accumulation of pyraclostrobin in earthworms, resulting in reduced weight and causing severe oxidative damage. Analysis of 16 S rRNA amplification revealed that exposure to pyraclostrobin and/or LDPE disrupts the microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels, leading to reduced alpha diversity in both the soil and earthworm gut. Furthermore, co -exposure to LDPE and pyraclostrobin increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the soil and earthworm gut by 2.15 and 1.34 times, respectively, compared to exposure to pyraclostrobin alone. It correlated well with the increasing relative abundance of genera carrying ARGs. Our findings contribute novel insights into the impact of co -exposure to MPs and pesticides on soil and earthworm microbiomes, highlighting their role in promoting the transfer of ARGs. This knowledge is crucial for managing the risk associated with the dissemination of ARGs in soil ecosystems.","Zhang, Yr; Qin, Kk; Liu, Cl",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133459,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Polystyrene Microplastics Impact The Occurrence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Earthworms By Size-Dependent Toxic Effects,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two classes of emerging and prevalent contaminants in terrestrial environments. To date, effects of MPs on the occurrence of ARGs in terrestrial invertebrates remain uncertain. Here we exposed earthworms to a soil amended with polystyrene MPs at two environmentally relevant concentrations to elucidate the occurrence and mechanisms of ARGs in earthworms impacted by MPs with different sizes. Nano-size and 10 mg/kg of 100 mu m MPs slightly affected the occurrence of ARGs in earthworms. Highest abundance of ARGs was found in the presence of 10 mg/kg of 10 mu m MPs, whereas 100 mg/ kg of 10 mu m MPs significantly changed the profile of ARGs. Metagenomics sequencing and toxicity tests indicated that MPs caused toxicity and influenced the abundance of microbial community in earthworms, resulting in the changes of ARGs. Results of proteomics and metabolomics demonstrated that 100 mg/kg of 10 mu m MPs changed the microenvironment of earthworm gut, built a new homeostatic process, and thus increased the abundance of key bacterial that carried a variety of ARGs. This study highlights the size-dependent toxic effects of MPs and their impacts on the transfer of ARGs in terrestrial environments.","Xu, Gh; Yu, Y",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125847,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Distinguishing Removal And Regrowth Potential Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria On Microplastics And In Leachate After Chlorination Or Fenton Oxidation,"The prevalence of antibiotic resistance, as well as microplastics (MPs) as vectors for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has attracting growing attention. However, the fate of ARB/ARGs on MPs treated by chlorination and Fenton oxidation were poorly understood. Herein, the removal and regrowth of ARGs/ARB on MPs and in MPs-surrounding landfill leachate (an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs) after chlorination and Fenton oxidation were comparatively analyzed. Target ARGs on MPs were reduced obviously less than that in leachate, with the largest percentages reduction of 34.0-46.3% vs. 54.3-77.6% after chlori-nation and 92.1-97.3% vs. > 99.9% after Fenton oxidation, and similar removal patterns were observed for ARB. Moreover, a considerable regrowth of ARGs/ARB in leachate were found after 48 h of storage at the end of chlorination (5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/L), and a greater regrowth of ARGs and ARB occurred on MPs with up to 17 and 139 fold, respectively. In contrast, Fenton oxidation achieved a reduced regrowth of target ARGs/ARB. These findings indicated that the removal of ARGs/ARB on MPs were more difficult than that in leachate, and ARGs/ ARB in leachate and especially on MPs exhibited a considerable potential for rapid regrowth after chlorination.","Shi, Jh; Wang, Bh; Li, Xa; Su, Yl; Wu, D; Xie, B",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128432,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Effects Of Polypropylene Microplastics On Digestion Performance, Microbial Community, And Antibiotic Resistance During Microbial Anaerobic Digestion","As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs) have attracted increasing attention worldwide. The effects of polypropylene (PP) MPs on digestion performance, behaviors of dominant microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements in microbial anaerobic digesters were investigated. The results showed that the addition of PP-MPs to digesters led to an increase in methane production of 10.8% when 300 particles/g TSS of PP-MPs was introduced compared with that in digester not treated with PP-MPs. This increase was attributed to the enrichment of acetogens such as Syntrophobacter (42.0%), Syntrophorhabdus (27.0%), and Syntrophomonas (10.6%), and methanogens including Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta. . tetX was highly enriched due to PP-MP exposure, whereas parC exhibited the greatest increase (35.5% - 222.7%). Horizontal gene transfer via ISCR1 and intI1 genes might play an important role in the spread of ARGs. Overall, these findings provide comprehensive insight into the ecological dynamics of PP-MPs during microbial anaerobic digestion.","Xiao, Y; Qin, Y; Jiang, Xy; Gao, P",10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131358,Bioresource Technology
Microplastics Shape Microbial Interactions And Affect The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Different Full-Scale Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) pose a potential threat to the environment because of the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs). However, the interactions between ARGs and MPs, which have both indirect and direct effects on ARG dissemination in WWTPs, remain unclear. In this study, spatiotemporal variations in different types of MPs, ten ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetA, tetO, tetM, tetX, tetW, qnrS, ermB, and ermC), class 1 integron integrase (intI1) and transposon Tn916/1545 in three typical WWTPs were characterized. Sul1, tetO, and sul2 were the predominant ARGs in the targeted WWTPs, whereas the intI1 and transposon Tn916/1545 were positively correlated with most of the targeted ARGs. Saccharimonadales (4.15 %), Trichococcus (2.60 %), Nitrospira (1.96 %), Candidatus amarolinea (1.79 %), and SC-I-84 (belonging to phylum Proteobacteria) (1.78 %) were the dominant genera. Network and redundancy analyses showed that Trichococcus, Faecalibacterium, Arcobacter, and Prevotella copri were potential hosts of ARGs, whereas Candidatus campbellbacteria and Candidatus kaiserbacteria were negatively correlated with ARGs. The potential hosts of ARGs had a strong positive correlation with polyethylene terephthalate, silicone resin, and fluor rubber and a negative correlation with polyurethane. Candidatus campbellbacteria and Candidatus kaiserbacteria were positively correlated with polyurethane, whereas potential hosts of ARGs were positively correlated with polypropylene and fluor rubber. Structural equation modeling highlighted that intI1, transposon Tn916/1545 and microbial communities, particularly microbial diversity, dominated the dissemination of ARGs, whereas MPs had a significant positive correlation with microbial abundance. Our study deepens the understanding of the relationships between ARGs and MPs in WWTPs, which will be helpful in designing strategies for inhibiting ARG hosts in WWTPs.","Xu, M; Chen, Mk; Pan, Cy; Xu, Rz; Gao, P; Chen, Hq; Shen, Xx",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168313,Science Of The Total Environment
Size-Dependent Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes Fate In Wastewater Treatment Systems: The Role Of Changed Surface Property And Microbial Assemblages In A Continuous Exposure Mode,"Microplastics (MPs) were continuously transported to wastewater treatment systems and accumulated in sludge con-stantly, potentially affecting systems function and co-occurrent contaminants fate. However, previous studies were based on acute exposure of MPs, which could not reflect the dynamics of MPs accumulation. Herein, this study firstly raised a more realistic method to evaluate the practical impacts of MPs on systems purification efficiency and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) fate. Continuous exposure of MPs did not pose negative effects on nutrients removal, but sig-nificantly changed the occurrence patterns of ARGs. ARGs abundances increased by 42.8 % and 54.3 % when exposed to millimeter-size MPs (mm-MPs) polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, but increased by 31.3 % and 39.4 % to micron-size MPs (gm-MPs), respectively. Thus, mm-MPs posed severer effects on ARGs than gm-MPs. Further, mm -MPs surface properties were obviously altered after long-term exposure (higher specific surface area and O -containing species), which benefited microbes attachment. More importantly, more taxa linkages and changed topo-logical properties (higher average degree and average weight) of co-occurrent network were observed in sludge with mm-MPs than with gm-MPs, as well as totally different potential host bacteria of ARGs. Rough surface of MPs and closer relations between ARGs and bacteria taxa contributed to the propagation of ARGs, which accounted for the observed higher ARGs abundances of mm-MPs. This study demonstrated that long-term accumulation of MPs in wastewater treatment systems affected ARGs fate, and mm-MPs caused severer risk due to their enrichment of ARGs. The results would promote the understanding of MPs real environmental behavior and influences.","Wang, Zf; Su, Yl; Zhu, Jd; Wu, D; Xie, B",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158264,Science Of The Total Environment
Plasmid Classification In An Era Of Whole-Genome Sequencing: Application In Studies Of Antibiotic Resistance Epidemiology,"Plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements ubiquitous in bacteria, and commonly transmissible between host cells. Their genomes include variable repertoires of 'accessory genes,' such as antibiotic resistance genes, as well as 'backbone' loci which are largely conserved within plasmid families, and often involved in key plasmid-specific functions (e.g., replication, stable inheritance, mobility). Classifying plasmids into different types according to their phylogenetic relatedness provides insight into the epidemiology of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. Current typing schemes exploit backbone loci associated with replication (replicon typing), or plasmid mobility (MOB typing). Conventional PCR-based methods for plasmid typing remain widely used. With the emergence of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), large datasets can be analyzed using in silico plasmid typing methods. However, short reads from popular high-throughput sequencers can be challenging to assemble, so complete plasmid sequences may not be accurately reconstructed. Therefore, localizing resistance genes to specific plasmids may be difficult, limiting epidemiological insight. Long-read sequencing will become increasingly popular as costs decline, especially when resolving accurate plasmid structures is the primary goal. This review discusses the application of plasmid classification in WGS-based studies of antibiotic resistance epidemiology; novel in silico plasmid analysis tools are highlighted. Due to the diverse and plastic nature of plasmid genomes, current typing schemes do not classify all plasmids, and identifying conserved, phylogenetically concordant genes for subtyping and phylogenetics is challenging. Analyzing plasmids as nodes in a network that represents gene-sharing relationships between plasmids provides a complementary way to assess plasmid diversity, and allows inferences about horizontal gene transfer to be made.","Orlek, A; Stoesser, N; Anjum, Mf; Doumith, M; Ellington, Mj; Peto, T; Crook, D; Woodford, N; Walker, As; Phan, H; Sheppard, Ae",10.3389/fmicb.2017.00182,Frontiers In Microbiology
"Interactions Of Microplastics With Organic, Inorganic And Bio-Pollutants And The Ecotoxicological Effects On Terrestrial And Aquatic Organisms","As emerging contaminants, microplastics (MPs) have attracted global attention. They are a potential risk to organisms, ecosystems and human health. MPs are characterized by small particle sizes, weak photodegradability, and are good environmental carriers. They can physically adsorb or chemically react with organic, inorganic and bio-pollutants to generate complex binary pollutants or change the environmental behaviors of these pollutants. We systematically reviewed the following aspects of MPs: (i) Adsorption of heavy metals and organic pollutants by MPs and the key environmental factors affecting adsorption behaviors; (ii) Enrichment and release of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on MPs and the effects of MPs on ARG migration in the environment; (iii) Formation of plastisphere and interactions between MPs and microorganisms; (iv) Ecotoxicological effects of MPs and their co-exposures with other pollutants. Finally, scientific knowledge gaps and future research areas on MPs are summarized, including standardization of study methodologies, ecological effects and human health risks of MPs and their combination with other pollutants.","Song, Xc; Zhuang, W; Cui, Hz; Liu, M; Gao, T; Li, A; Gao, Zh",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156068,Science Of The Total Environment
"Persistent Versus Transient, And Conventional Plastic Versus Biodegradable Plastic? - Two Key Questions About Microplastic-Water Exchange Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes","The ubiquitous microplastics (MPs) in water environment play an important role in the dissemination of anti-biotic resistance genes (ARGs) due to their exchange between floating MPs and receiving waters. However, whether the ARG exchange is persistent or transient and what are the differences in ARG exchange between conventional plastics and biodegradable plastics are the two key issues to be addressed. In this study, biode-gradable PBAT and non-biodegradable PET MPs were chosen to explore the MP-water ARG exchange after the MPs floated to the receiving waters. The results demonstrated that the active exchange of ARGs between MPs and receiving waters occurred, which, however, were transient for most of ARGs. The relative abundance of ARGs both on the MPs and in the waters rapidly decreased to the initial or lower levels within 4 weeks. Approximately 25-50% (ARG subtype number ratio) of studied ARG subtypes were introduced into the receiving waters by MPs, and 35-65% of studied ARG subtypes went through fluctuation in terms of abundance on MPs and in the receiving water. ARGs tended to converge between MPs and the receiving waters with time. Furthermore, the ARG exchange between MPs and waters facilitated horizontal gene transfer (HGT). IntI1 and tnpA05 played the crucial roles in HGT, which was indicated by their correlated change with most ARGs; in contrast, tnpA04 showed the obvious lagging responses. The biodegradable MP of PBAT generally accumulated higher levels of most ARGs including multidrug resistant genes than the non-biodegradable MP of PET. The transient exchange of most ARGs between MPs and water implies that the on-off hitchhiking of ARGs on MPs in aquatic environment may not exert significant influence on ARG transmission. However, compared with the conventional plastics, the biodegradable MPs might pose much higher ARG dissemination risks due to the higher enrichment of ARGs particularly with people's ever-increasingly usage. Enough attention must be paid to this emerging issue.","Zhou, Q; Zhang, J; Zhang, M; Wang, Xa; Zhang, Dy; Pan, Xl",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118899,Water Research
Microplastics Enhance The Prevalence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Sludge Digestion By Enriching Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Surface Biofilm And Facilitating The Vertical And Horizontal Gene Transfer,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs) are recognized as emerging contaminants and threats to global human health. Despite both of them being significantly detected in their hotspots, i.e., waste activated sludge (WAS), rare studies on how MPs affect ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in anaerobic sludge digestion are available. Herein, the fate of ARGs and ARB after exposure to MPs of three dosages (10, 30, and 80 particles/g-TS), three polymer types (LDPE, PET, and PS), and three branching extents (LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE) in anaerobic sludge digestion was investigated. Metagenomic results indicated that all variants of MPs resulted in an increase of the relative abundance of ARGs in the digester compared to the control. The abundance of ARGs demonstrated a dosage-dependent relationship within the range from 10 to 80 particles/g-TS, resulting in an increase from 4.5 to 27.9% compared to the control. Branching structure and polymer type influence ARG level in the sludge digester as well. Mechanism studies revealed that LDPE selectively enriched potential ARB and ARGs in the surface biofilm, possibly creating a favorable environment for ARB proliferation and ARG exchange. Furthermore, vertical transfer of ARGs was facilitated by LDPE through increasing bacterial cell proliferation accompanied by the enhancement of relevant functional genes. The elevated abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and ARGs-carrying plasmids also demonstrated that MGE-mediated horizontal transfer was promoted by LDPE at 80 particles/g-TS. This effect was compounded by increased oxidative stress, cell membrane permeability, and cell cohesion, collectively facilitating horizontal ARG transfer. Consequently, both vertical and horizontal transfer of ARGs could be concurrently promoted by LDPE an in anaerobic sludge digester.","Luo, Ty; Dai, Xh; Wei, W; Xu, Qx; Ni, Bj",10.1021/acs.est.3c02815,Environmental Science & Technology
Long-Term Application Of Organic Fertilizer Prompting The Dispersal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Their Health Risks In The Soil Plastisphere,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is a rapidly growing global environmental concern that has led to the emergence of a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere, which is a hotspot for the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs). However, studies on the effects of long-term organic fertilizer application on the dispersal of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the plastisphere of farmland soil have been limited. Here, we performed a field culture experiment by burying nylon bags filled with MPs in paddy soil that had been treated with different fertilizers for over 30 years to explore the changes of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastisphere. Our results show that the soil plastisphere amplified the ARG and VFG pollution caused by organic fertilization by 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively. And it also led to a 2.7-fold increase in the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Meanwhile, the plastisphere tended to promote deterministic process in the community assembly of HBPs, with an increase of 1.4 times. Network analysis found a significant correlation between ARGs, VFGs, and bacteria in plastisphere. Correlation analysis highlight the important role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in shaping the abundance of ARGs and VFGs, respectively.

Marine Plastics From Norwegian West Coast Carry Potentially Virulent Fish Pathogens And Opportunistic Human Pathogens Harboring New Variants Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"To our best knowledge this is the first study characterizing fish pathogens isolated from marine plastics from the West coast of Norway for their potential for pathogenicity using whole genome sequencing. Marine plastic polymers identified as polyethylene, polyethylene/ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polypropylene, yielded a total of 37 bacterial isolates dominated byPseudomonasspp. (70%). Six isolates representing either fish pathogens or opportunistic human pathogens were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS). These included four isolates belonging toAeromonasspp., oneAcinetobacter beijerinckiiisolate and oneMorganella morganiiisolate.

"The Responses Of Microbial Metabolic Activity, Bacterial Community And Resistance Genes Under The Coexistence Of Nanoplastics And Quaternary Ammonium Compounds In The Sewage Environment","Nanoplastics (NPs) and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are frequently detected in sewage. However, little is known about the risks of coexistence of NPs and QACs. In this study, the responses of microbial metabolic activity, bacterial community and resistance genes (RGs) to the exposure of polyethylene (PE), polylactic acid (PLA), silicon dioxide (SiO2) and dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) were focused on 2nd and 30th day of incubation in sewer environment. Bacterial community contributed 25.01 % to shape RGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) after two days of incubation in sewage and plastisphere. After 30 days of incubation, the most important individual factor (35.82 %) was turned to microbial metabolic activity. The metabolic capacity of the microbial communities in plastisphere was stronger than that from SiO2 samples. Moreover, DDBAC inhibited the metabolic capacity of microorganisms in sewage samples, and increased the absolute abundances of 16S rRNA in plastisphere and sewage samples which might be similar to the hormesis effect. After 30 days of incubation, Aquabacterium was the predominant genus in plastisphere. As for SiO2 samples, Brevundimonas was the predominant genus. QACs RGs (qacEdelta101, qacEdelta1-02) and antibiotic RGs (ARGs) (aac(6 ')-Ib, tetG-1) significantly enriched in plastisphere. There was also co-selection among qacEdelta1-01, qacEdelta1-02 and ARGs. In addition, VadinBC27 which enriched in plastisphere of PLA NPs was positively correlated with the potentially disease-causing genus Pseudomonas. It showed that after 30 days of incubation, plastisphere had an important effect on distribution and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and RGs. Plastisphere of PLA NPs also carried the risk of spreading disease.","Zhang, Y; Gao, Jf; Wang, Zq; Zhao, Yf; Liu, Y; Zhang, Hr; Zhao, My",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163064,Science Of The Total Environment
"Microplastic Biofilms In Water Treatment Systems: Fate And Risks Of Pathogenic Bacteria, Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, And Antibiotic Resistance Genes","Microplastics (MPs) biofilms in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants (DWTPs and WWTPs) have gained increasing attention due to their potential to come into close contact with humans. This review examines the fate of pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in MP biofilms and their impacts on operations in DWTPs and WWTPs, as well as the associated microbial risks for ecology and human health. The literature shows that pathogenic bacteria, ARBs, and ARGs with high resistance can persist on MP surfaces and may escape treatment plants, contaminating drinking and receiving water. Nine potential pathogens, ARB, and ARGs can be retained in DWTPs and sixteen in WWTPs. While MP biofilms can improve the removal of MPs themselves, as well as the associated heavy metals and antibiotic compounds, they can also induce biofouling, hinder the effectiveness of chlorination and ozonation, and cause the formation of disinfection by-products. Furthermore, the operation-resistant pathogenic bacteria, ARB, and ARGs on MPs may have adverse impacts on receiving ecosystems, as well as human health, including a range of human diseases, from skin infections to pneumonia and meningitis. Given the significant implications of MP biofilms for aquatic ecosystems and human health, further research is necessary on the disinfection resistance of microbial populations in MP biofilm. This study provides valuable insights into the comprehensive understanding of the changes of MP biofilms in water and wastewater treatment systems as well as their impacts on ecology and human health.","Nguyen, Ht; Lee, Yk; Kwon, Jh; Hur, J",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164523,Science Of The Total Environment
Polystyrene Microplastics Alleviate The Effects Of Sulfamethazine On Soil Microbial Communities At Different Co2 Concentrations,"Microplastics were reported to adsorb antibiotics and may modify their effects on soil systems. But there has been little research investigating how microplastics may affect the toxicities of antibiotics to microbes under future climate conditions. Here, we used a free-air CO2 enrichment system to investigate the responses of soil microbes to sulfamethazine (SMZ, 1 mg kg(-1)) in the presence of polystyrene microplastics (PS, 5 mg kg(-1)) at different CO2 concentrations (ambient at 380 ppm and elevated at 580 ppm). SMZ alone decreased bacterial diversity, negatively affected the bacterial structure and inter-relationships, and enriched the sulfonamide-resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) and class 1 integron (intl1). PS, at both CO2 conditions, showed little effect on soil bacteria but markedly alleviated SMZ's adverse effects on bacterial diversity, composition and structure, and inhibited sul1 transmission by decreasing the intl1 abundance. Elevated CO2 had limited modification in SMZ's disadvantages to microbial communities but markedly decreased the sul1 and sul2 abundance. Results indicated that increasing CO2 concentration or the presence of PS affected the responses of soil microbes to SMZ, providing new insights into the risk prediction of antibiotics under future climate conditions.","Xu, Ml; Du, Wc; Ai, Fx; Xu, F; Zhu, Jg; Yin, Y; Ji, R; Guo, Hy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125286,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Multiomics Analysis Of The Effects Of Manure-Borne Doxycycline Combined With Oversized Fiber Microplastics On Pak Choi Growth And The Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transmission,"In this study, oversized microplastics (OMPs) were intentionally introduced into soil containing manure -borne doxycycline (DOX). This strategic approach was used to systematically examine the effects of combined OMP and DOX pollution on the growth of pak choi, analyze alterations in soil environmental metabolites, and explore the potential migration of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results revealed a more pronounced impact of DOX than of OMPs. Slender -fiber OMPs (SF OMPs) had a more substantial influence on the growth of pak choi than did coarse -fiber OMPs (CF OMPs). Conversely, CF OMPs had a more significant effect on the migration of ARGs within the system. When DOX was combined with OMPs, the negative effects of DOX on pak choi growth were mitigated through the synthesis of indole through the adjustment of carbon metabolism and amino acid metabolism in pak choi roots. In this process, Pseudohongiellaceae and Xanthomonadaceae were key bacteria. During the migration of ARGs, the potential host bacterium Limnobacter should be considered. Additionally, the majority of potential host bacteria in the pak choi endophytic environment were associated with tet G. This study provides insights into the intricate interplay among DOX, OMPs, ARGs, plant growth, soil metabolism, and the microbiome.","Chen, Jy; Niu, Sh; Li, Hy; Liao, Xd; Xing, Sc",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134931,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Entry Pathways Determined The Effects Of Mps On Sludge Anaerobic Digestion System: The Views Of Methane Production And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Fates,"Sludge is one of the primary reservoirs of microplastics (MPs), and the effects of MPs on subsequent sludge treatment raised attention. Given the entry pathways, MPs would exhibit different properties, but the entry pathway-dependent effect of MPs on sludge treatment performance and the fates of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), another high-risk emerging contaminant, were seldom documented. Herein, MPs with two predominant entry pathways, including wastewater-derived (WW-derived) and anaerobic digestion-introduced (AD-introduced), were used to investigate the effects on AD performance and ARGs abundances. The results indicated that WW-derived MPs, namely the MPs accumulated in sludge during the wastewater treatment process, exhibited significant inhibition on methane production by 22.8%-71.6%, while the AD-introduced MPs, being introduced in the sludge AD process, slightly increased the methane yield by 4.7%-17.1%. Meanwhile, MPs were responsible for promoting transmission of target ARGs, and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) showed a greater promotion effect (0.0154-0.0936) than polyamide MPs (PA-MPs) (0.0013-0.0724). Compared to size, entry pathways and types played more vital roles on MPs influences. Investigation on mechanisms based on microbial community structure revealed characteristics (aging degree and types) of MPs determined the differences of AD performance and ARGs fates. WW-derived MPs with longer aging period and higher aging degree would release toxics and decrease the activities of microorganisms, resulting in the negative impact on AD performance. However, AD-introduced MPs with short aging period exhibited marginal impacts on AD performance. Furthermore, the co-occurrent network analysis suggested that the variations of potential host bacteria induced by MPs with different types and aging degree attributed to the dissemination of ARGs. Distinctively from most previous studies, the MPs with different sizes did not show remarkable effects on AD performance and ARGs fates. Our findings benefited the understanding of realistic environmental behavior and effect of MPs with different sources.","Wang, Xt; Huang, Gc; Chen, Qr; Pang, Rr; Han, Zb; Zhu, Jd; Xie, B; Su, Yl; Zhou, S",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119061,Environmental Research
Incomplete Degradation Of Aromatic-Aliphatic Copolymer Leads To Proliferation Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Biodegradable plastics (BDPs) have attracted extensive attention as an alternative to conventional plastics. BDPs could be mineralized by composting, while the quality of compost affected by the presence of BDPs and the residual microplastics (MPs) has not been well evaluated. This study aimed to explore the MPs release potential and environmental implications of commercial BDPs (aromatic-aliphatic copolymer) films in uncontrolled composting. Results showed that the molecular weight of BDPs decreased by >60% within 60 d. However, the non-extracted organic matter and wet-sieving measurements indicated that MPs continuously released and accumulated during regular composting. The average MPs release potential (0.1-5 mm) was 134.6 +/- 18.1 particles/mg (BDPs), which resulted in 10(3)-10(4) particles/g dw in compost. The plastisphere of MPs showed a significantly higher (0.95-16.76 times) abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which resulted in the rising (1.34-2.24 times) of ARGs in compost heaps, in comparison to the control groups. Overall, BDPs promote the spread of ARGs through the selective enrichment of bacteria and horizontal transfer from released MPs. These findings confirmed that BDPs could enhance the release potential of MPs and the dissemination of ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding and environmental risk of BDPs.","Zhang, Yc; Tao, Jp; Bai, Yd; Wang, F; Xie, B",10.1016/j.envint.2023.108291,Environment International
Constructed Wetlands As Neglected Fixed Source Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Natural Water Bodies?,"The pollution status and the harm caused by microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic ecosystems have been a growing concern. The presence of microplastics could accelerate the transfer and spread of ARGs. Before sewage reaches natural water bodies, microplastics and ARGs need to be eliminated through specific processes. Constructed wetlands are currently an effective and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment process. Research has shown significant effectiveness in removing microplastics and ARGs. Micro plastics and ARGs can be removed through processes such as adsorption, capture, adhesion, and biodegradation. However, long-term continuous operation could lead to constructed wetlands becoming significant reservoirs of microplastics and ARGs. Inflow loads and seasonal variations in constructed wetlands may result in the reintroduction of persistent microplastics and ARGs into the receiving water body, establishing the constructed wetland as a continuous source of these pollutants in the receiving water body. The key to the widespread application of constructed wetlands lies in solving this challenging problem. Therefore, although constructed wetlands serve as a green strategy for removing microplastics and ARGs, there are still many gaps in our knowledge. Based on the current accumulation of microplastics and ARGs in constructed wetlands, this paper summarizes the removal of microplastics and ARGs in existing constructed wetlands and explores the interaction between them. Additionally, it proposes suggestions for optimizing the process and improving the reliability of monitoring microplastics and ARGs in sewage.","Zhao, Yf; Jin, Rx; Chen, Yh; Zhang, Jh; Tao, Sy; Liu, Sw; Shen, Mc",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166474,Science Of The Total Environment
Effect Of Polyethylene Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Comparison Based On Different Soil Types And Plant Types,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two types of contaminants that are widely present in the soil environment. MPs can act as carriers of microbes, facilitating the colonization and spread of ARGs and thus posing potential hazards to ecosystem safety and human health. In the present study, we explored the microbial networks and ARG distribution characteristics in different soil types (heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soil and agricultural soil planted with different plants: Bidens pilosa L., Ipomoea aquatica F., and Brassica chinensis L.) after the application of MPs and evaluated environmental factors, potential microbial hosts, and ARGs. The microbial communities in the three rhizosphere soils were closely related to each other, and the modularity of the microbial networks was greater than 0.4. Moreover, the core taxa in the microbial networks, including Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Myxococcota, were important for resisting environmental stress. The ARG resistance mechanisms were dominated by antibiotic efflux in all three rhizosphere soils. Based on the annotation results, the MP treatments induced changes in the relative abundance of microbes carrying ARGs, and the G1-5 treatment significantly increased the abundance of MuxB in Verrucomicrobia, Elusimicrobia, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria. Path analysis showed that changes in MP particle size and dosage may indirectly affect soil enzyme activities by changing pH, which affects microbes and ARGs. We suggest that MPs may provide surfaces for ARG accumulation, leading to ARG enrichment in plants. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPs, as potentially persistent pollutants, can affect different types of soil environments and that the presence of ARGs may cause substantial environmental risks.","Li, Y; Shi, Xw; Zeng, M; Qin, Pq; Fu, My; Luo, Sy; Tang, Cj; Mo, Cj; Yu, Fm",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134581,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antibiotic Resistance At Environmental Multi-Media Interfaces Through Integrated Genotype And Phenotype Analysis,"Antibiotic resistance is currently an unfolding global crisis threatening human health worldwide. While antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are known to be pervasive in environmental media, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance at interfaces between two or more adjacent media is largely unknown. Here, we designed a microcosm study to simulate plastic pollution in paddy soil and used a novel method, stimulated Raman scattering coupled with deuterium oxide (D2O) 2 O) labelling, to compare the antibiotic resistance in a single medium with that at the interface of multiple environmental media (plastic, soil, water). Results revealed that the involvement of more types of environmental media at interfaces led to a higher proportion of active resistant bacteria. Genotypic analysis showed that ARGs (especially high-risk ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were all highly enriched at the interfaces. This enrichment was further enhanced by the co-stress of heavy metal (arsenic) and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin). Our study is the first to apply stimulated Raman scattering to elucidate antibiotic resistance at environmental interfaces and reveals novel pathway of antibiotic resistance dissemination in the environment and overlooked risks to human health.","Fu, Cx; Chen, C; Xiang, Q; Wang, Yf; Wang, L; Qi, Fy; Zhu, D; Li, Hz; Cui, L; Hong, Wl; Rillig, Mc; Zhu, Yg; Qiao, M",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136160,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Selective Enrichment Of Bacterial Pathogens By Microplastic Biofilm,"Microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation. Here, we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates (rock and leaf) under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles, and ARG microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure. Network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community, but with lower average path length, network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles. Metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad-spectrum and distinctive resistome. Specifically, according to taxonomic annotation of ARG microbial hosts, two opportunisitic human pathogens (Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mendocina) and one plant pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae) were detected only in the microplastic biofilm, but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates. Our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for ARGs and pathogens to new environment in river water, generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health.

The Effects Of Small Plastic Particles On Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer Revealed By Single Cell And Community Level Analysis,"Small plastic particles with sizes comparable to bacterial cells, widely exist in environment. However, their effects on antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dissemination remain unclear. Using polystyrene (PS) particles (0.2 mu m, 2 mu m, 5 mu m, 10 mu m, 15 mu m, 20 mu m) as models, conjugative transfer of ARGs between the donor E. coli and different recipients (E. coli or sludge bacterial community) was investigated. Compared to the pure strain, the sludge bacterial community exposed to PS particles showed higher transfer frequencies (1.67 to 14.31 times the blank control). The transfer frequencies first decreased and then increased with particle size, and plastics similar in size to bacteria (e.g., 2 mu m) appear to be a transitional zone with minimal impact on ARG transmission. Furthermore, using microfluidics, in-situ observation at single cell level found that 2 mu m plastics can act as barriers between donor and recipient bacteria inhibiting growth, but conjugation events mostly occurred around them. Conversely, nanoplastics (e.g., 0.2 mu m) and larger microplastics (e.g., 20 mu m) significantly promote conjugation, mainly due to increased reactive oxygen species production and cell membrane permeability, or facilitating bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, respectively. This study aids in assessing environmental risks of small plastic particles on ARG dissemination.","Luo, Yq; Xu, Ts; Li, B; Liu, F; Wu, Bb; Dobson, Ps; Yin, Hb; Chen, Z; Qiu, Y; Huang, X",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136271,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
A Neglected Risk Of Nanoplastics As Revealed By The Promoted Transformation Of Plasmid-Borne Ampicillin Resistance Gene By Escherichia Coli,"Plastic pollution and antibiotic resistance are two emerging environmental and human health crises today. Although it was revealed that microplastics can serve as vectors for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, it is still unclear how the nanoplastics influence the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Herein, we firstly compared the effect of polystyrene (PS) micro/nanoplastics on the transformation of plasmid-borne ARG, using a transformation model consisting of plasmid pUC19 (amp(R)) and Escherichia coli DH5 alpha (recipient). Due to its size effect, PS nanoplastics (10-500 mg/L) significantly enhanced the transformation efficiency (2.8-5.4 folds) and frequency (3.2-8.4 folds) of exogenous amp(R) into E. coli, while PS microplastics exerted no influence. The detailed mechanisms were found that nanoplastics induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, activated SOS response, increased cell membrane permeability and changed the secretion systems, thereby facilitating the uptake of exogenous DNA by bacteria. Moreover, the co-presences of nanoplastics with humic acid or Fe3+ relieved to some extent, but did not completely alleviate the promoting effect of nanoplastics on plasmid transformation. Our findings suggest that the risk of nanoplastics on promoting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance should not be neglected, and further studies are needed to investigate such risk in complex environments.","Wang, Xx; Li, H; Chen, Y; Meng, Xq; Dieketseng, My; Wang, Xm; Yan, S; Wang, Bz; Zhou, Lx; Zheng, Gy",10.1111/1462-2920.16178,Environmental Microbiology
"Microplastic Pollution Interaction With Disinfectant Resistance Genes: Research Progress, Environmental Impacts, And Potential Threats","The consumption of disposable plastic products and disinfectants has surged during the global COVID-19 pandemic, as they play a vital role in effectively preventing and controlling the spread of the virus. However, microplastic pollution and the excessive or improper use of disinfectants contribute to the increased environmental tolerance of microorganisms. Microplastics play a crucial role as vectors for microorganisms and plankton, facilitating energy transfer and horizontal gene exchange. The increase in the use of disinfectants has become a driving force for the growth of disinfectant resistant bacteria (DRB). A large number of microorganisms can have intense gene exchange, such as plasmid loss and capture, phage transduction, and cell fusion. The reproduction and diffusion rate of DRB in the environment is significantly higher than that of ordinary microorganisms, which will greatly increase the environmental tolerance of DRB. Unfortunately, there is still a huge knowledge gap in the interaction between microplastics and disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs). Accordingly, it is critical to comprehensively summarize the formation and transmission routes of DRGs on microplastics to address the problem. This paper systematically analyzed the process and mechanisms of DRGs formed by microbes. The interaction between microplastics and DRGs and the contribution of microplastic on the diffusion and spread of DRGs were expounded. The potential threats to the ecological environment and human health were also discussed. Additionally, some challenges and future priorities were also proposed with a view to providing useful basis for further research.","Zhang, Jh; Li, Th; Tao, Sy; Shen, Mc",10.1007/s11356-024-32225-0,Environmental Science And Pollution Research
A Fungal Avirulence Factor Encoded In A Highly Plastic Genomic Region Triggers Partial Resistance To Septoria Tritici Blotch,"Cultivar-strain specificity in the wheat-Zymoseptoria tritici pathosystem determines the infection outcome and is controlled by resistance genes on the host side, many of which have been identified. On the pathogen side, however, the molecular determinants of specificity remain largely unknown. We used genetic mapping, targeted gene disruption and allele swapping to characterise the recognition of the new avirulence factor Avr3D1. We then combined population genetic and comparative genomic analyses to characterise the evolutionary trajectory of Avr3D1. Avr3D1 is specifically recognised by wheat cultivars harbouring the Stb7 resistance gene, triggering a strong defence response without preventing pathogen infection and reproduction. Avr3D1 resides in a cluster of putative effector genes located in a genome region populated by independent transposable element insertions. The gene was present in all 132 investigated strains and is highly polymorphic, with 30 different protein variants identified. We demonstrated that specific amino acid substitutions in Avr3D1 led to evasion of recognition. These results demonstrate that quantitative resistance and gene-for-gene interactions are not mutually exclusive. Localising avirulence genes in highly plastic genomic regions probably facilitates accelerated evolution that enables escape from recognition by resistance proteins.","Meile, L; Croll, D; Brunner, Pc; Plissonneau, C; Hartmann, Fe; Mcdonald, Ba; Sánchez-Vallet, A",10.1111/nph.15180,New Phytologist
Phthalates Boost Natural Transformation Of Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes Through Enhancing Bacterial Motility And Dna Environmental Persistence,"The environmental dissemination of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) in wastewater and natural water bodies has aroused growing ecological concerns. The coexisting chemical pollutants in water are known to markedly affect the eARGs transfer behaviors of the environmental microbial community, but the detailed interactions and specific impacts remain elusive so far. Here, we revealed a concentration-dependent impact of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and several other types of phthalate esters (common water pollutants released from plastics) on the natural transformation of eARGs. The DMP exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (10 mu g/L) resulted in a 4.8-times raised transformation frequency of Acinetobacter baylyi but severely suppressed the transformation at a high concentration (1000 mu g/L). The promotion by low-concentration DMP was attributed to multiple mechanisms, including increased bacterial mobility and membrane permeability to facilitate eARGs uptake and improved resistance of the DMP-bounded eARGs (via noncovalent interaction) to enzymatic degradation (with suppressed DNase activity). Similar promoting effects of DMP on the eARGs transformation were also found in real wastewater and biofilm systems. In contrast, higher-concentration DMP suppressed the eARGs transformation by disrupting the DNA structure. Our findings highlight a potentially underestimated eARGs spreading in aquatic environments due to the impacts of coexisting chemical pollutants and deepen our understanding of the risks of biological-chemical combined pollution in wastewater and environmental water bodies.","Wu, J; Lv, Yh; Sun, D; Zhou, Jh; Wu, J; He, Rl; Liu, Df; Song, H; Li, Ww",10.1021/acs.est.4c02751,Environmental Science & Technology
Host Species And Microplastics Differentiate The Crop Root Endophytic Antibiotic Resistome,"The increasing One-Health concept calls for a more in-depth understanding of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in plant microbiomes. While there is considerable published evidence that microplastics can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment, whether and how microplastics impact the plant endophytic resistome are largely unknown. Here we examined the ARGs along the soil-root continuum of maize and wheat under the pressure of microplastics. Amendment with heavy metals was also included as they can apply the selective pressure for ARG spread as well. The crop species and genotypes had significant effects on the root endophytic ARG abundance and diversity. The greatest ARG abundance was observed in the maize ZD958 endophytes (0.215 copies per 16S rRNA gene), followed by the maize XY335 (0.092 copies per 16S rRNA gene). For each crop genotype, amendment with microplastics and heavy metals significantly increased the ARG abundances and changed their profiles in root endophytes. The endophytic ARG variances were closely associ-ated with the endophytic microbiome, the rhizosphere bacterial communities and resistome. Additionally, the level of endophytic ARGs was positively relevant to the abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These findings suggested that the root endophytic resistome was primarily affected by the crop species, and microplastics might show enhancement effects on the endophytic resistome via changing the root-associated microbiome and facilitating the MGE mediation. Overall, this study, for the first time, highlights the root endophytic ARG emergence and dissemination induced by microplastics.","Sun, Yz; Li, Xf; Ding, Cf; Pan, Qc; Wang, J",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130091,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastisphere Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Bird'S-Eye View On The Plastic-Specific Diversity And Enrichment,"The microplastisphere is a dense consortium of metabolically active microorganisms that develops on the surface of microplastics. Since the discovery that it harbors antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), there has been a quest to decipher the relationship between ARG occurrences and selective enrichment with plastic types, which is important to understand their fate in diverse environmental settings. Nonetheless, it remains a neglected topic, and this developing field of microplastics research could benefit from a comprehensive review to acquire a deeper understanding of the most recent advances and drive scientific progress. Accordingly, the goal of this review is to critically discuss and provide an in-depth assessment of the evidence of ARGs' global nature in microplastispheres, as well as explore factors that influence them directly and indirectly, highlighting important concerns and knowledge gaps throughout the article. By comprehensively covering them, we underscore the potential environmental implications associated with microplastisphere ARGs. From our analysis, it emerged that microplastisphere ARGs are likely to be impacted not only by differences in microplastic types and characteristics but also by how their environments are shaped by other agents such as physiochemical properties, socioeconomic factors, and contaminants coexistence, influencing ARG subtype, incidence, abundance, and selective enrichment. The intricate relationship of microplastisphere ARGs to environmental conditions and plastic types calls for multilevel investigations to clearly assess the environmental fate of microplastics. We anticipate that this review could assist researchers in strengthening their foundation and identifying efforts to advance knowledge in this research field.","Shruti, Vc; Kutralam-Muniasamy, G; Pérez-Guevara, F",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169316,Science Of The Total Environment
Antibiotic Resistomes In Face-Mask Biofilm Along An Urban River: Multiple Drivers And Co-Occurrence With Human Opportunistic Pathogens,"Discarded face masks from the global COVID-19 pandemic have contributed significantly to plastic pollution in surface water, whereas their potential as a reservoir for aquatic pollutants is not well understood. Herein, we conducted a field experiment along a human-impacted urban river, investigating the variations of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), pathogens, and water-borne contaminants in commonly-used face masks. Results showed that high-biomass biofilms formed on face masks selectively enriched more ARGs than stone biofilm (0.08-0.22 vs 0.07-0.15 copies/16 S rRNA gene copies) from bulk water, which mainly due to unique microbial communities, enhanced horizontal gene transfer, and selective pressure of accumulated contaminants based on redundancy analysis and variation partitioning analysis. Several human opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Acinetobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacillus, and Klebsiella), which are considered potential ARG carriers, were also greatly concentrated in face-mask biofilms, imposing a potential threat to aquatic ecological environment and human health. Moreover, wastewater treatment plant effluents, as an important source of pollutants to urban rivers, further aggravated the abundances of ARGs and opportunistic pathogens in face-mask biofilms. Our findings demonstrated that discarded face masks provide a hotspot for the proliferation and spread of ARGs and pathogens in urban water, highlighting the urgent requirement for implementing stricter regulations in face mask disposal.","Liu, Yj; Li, Zh; He, Yt; Yuan, L; Sheng, Gp",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131587,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Quantifying Health Risks Of Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistome And Deciphering Driving Mechanisms In An Urbanizing Watershed,"Microplastics (MPs) ubiquitous in environments promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), threatening ecosystem safety and human health. However, quantitative assessments of the health risks of ARGs (HRA) in plastisphere and an in-depth exploration of their driving mechanisms are still lacking. Here, the microbiomes, ARGs, and community assembly processes of five types of MPs in an urbanizing watershed were systematically investigated. By fully considering the abundance, clinical availability, human pathogenicity, human accessibility, and mobility of 660 ARGs in plastisphere, the HRA on MPs were quantified and compared. Polyethylene had the highest HRA among the five MP types, and urbanization further increased its risk index. In addition to abiotic factors, more complex biotic factors have been shown to drive HRA in plastisphere. Specifically, dispersal limitation accounted for the increasing diversity and interaction of bacteria that determined HRA in plastisphere. Further analysis of metabolic functions indicated that a higher HRA was accompanied by decreased normal metabolic functions of plastisphere microbiota due to the higher fitness costs of ARGs. This study advances the quantitative surveillance of HRA in plastisphere and understanding of its driving mechanisms. This will be helpful for the management of both MPs and ARGs treatments for human health.","Zhu, Lj; Li, Rl; Yang, K; Xu, F; Lin, Cs; Chen, Ql; Zhu, D; Sun, Q; Zhu, Yg; Cui, L",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120574,Water Research
Effects Of Heavy Metal And Disinfectant On Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factor Genes In The Plastisphere From Diverse Soil Ecosystems,"Antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) are world-wide contaminants posing potential health risks. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and heavy metals can apply selective pressure on antibiotic resistance. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding their coupled effect on changes in ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in various soil types and their plastispheres. Herein, we conducted a microcosm experiment to explore the abundances and profiles of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastispheres from three distinct types of soils amended with Cu and disinfectants. The plastispheres enriched the ARGs' abundance compared to soils and stimulated the coupling effect of combined pollutants on promoting the abundances of ARGs and VFGs. Horizontal gene transfer inevitably accelerates the propagation of ARGs and VFGs in plastispheres under pollutant stress. In plastispheres, combined exposure to disinfectants and Cu increased some potential pathogens' relative abundances. Moreover, the combined effect of disinfectants and Cu on ARGs and VFGs changed with soil type in plastispheres, emphasising the necessity to incorporate soil type considerations into health risk assessments for ARGs and VFGs. Overall, this study highlights the high health risks of ARGs under the selective pressure of combined pollutants in plastispheres and provides valuable insights for future risk assessments related to antibiotic resistance.","Ni, B; Zhang, Tl; Cai, Tg; Xiang, Q; Zhu, D",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133335,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factors In The Plastisphere In Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluent: Health Risk Quantification And Driving Mechanism Interpretation,"Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and provide a unique niche for the spread of pollutants. To date, risk assessments and driving mechanisms of pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and virulence factors (VFs) in the plastisphere are still lacking. Here, the microbiota, ARGs, VFs, their potential health risks, and biologically driving mechanisms on polythene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) and polylactic acid blends (PBAT/PLA), PLA MPs, and gravel in WWTP effluent were investigated. The results showed that plastisphere and gravel biofilm harbored more distinctive microorganisms, promoting the uniqueness of pathogens, ARGs, and VFs compared to WWTP effluent. The abundance of major pathogens, ARGs, and VFs in the plastisphere was 1.01-1.35 times higher than that in the effluent. The high health risk of ARGs (HRA) calculated by fully considering the abundance, clinical relevance, pathogenicity, accessibility and mobility, and the high proportion of resistance contigs with mobile genetic elements confirmed that the plastisphere posed the highest potential health risk. Candidatus Microthrix and Candidatus Promineifilum were the essential hosts of ARGs and VFs in the plastisphere and gravel biofilm, respectively. High metabolic activity such as amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and highly expressed key genes increased the synthesis of ARGs and VFs. The primary mechanisms driving ARG enrichment in the plastisphere were enhanced microbial metabolic activity, increased frequency of horizontal gene transfer, heightened antibiotic inactivation and efflux, and reduced cell permeability. This study provided new insights into the ARGs, VFs, and health risks of the plastisphere and emphasized the importance of strict control of wastewater discharge.","Wang, Yx; Liu, Xh; Huang, Cd; Han, Wp; Gu, Pc; Jing, Rx; Yang, Q",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122896,Water Research
Slower Antibiotics Degradation And Higher Resistance Genes Enrichment In Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) are increasingly entering the urban aquatic ecosystems, and the environmental significance and health risks of plastisphere, a special biofilm on MPs, have received widespread attention. In this study, MPs of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and quartzite were incubated in an urban water envi-ronment, and the tetracycline (TC) degradation ability was compared. Approximatedly 24% of TC biodegraded in 28 d in the water-quartzite system, which is significantly higher than that in the water-PLA (17.3%) and water -PVC systems (16.7%). Re-incubation of microorganisms in biofilms affirmed that quartzite biofilm has a higher TC degradation capacity than the plastisphere. According to high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenomic analysis, quartzite biofilm contained more abundant potential TC degrading bacteria, genes related to TC degradation (eutG, aceE, and DLAT), and metabolic pathways related to TC degradation. An oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface might lead to the higher metabolic capacity of quartzite biofilm for un-conventional carbons, e.g., TC. It is also found that, compared with quartzite biofilm, the distinct microbes in the plastisphere carried more antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Higher affinity of MPs surface to antibiotics may lead to higher antibiotics stress on the plastisphere, which further amplify the carrying capacity for ARGs of microorganisms in the plastisphere. Compared to the nondegradable PVC MPs, surface of the biodegradable PLA plastics harbored significantly higher amounts of biomass and ARGs. Compared to the mineral particles, the capability of plastisphere has lower ability to degrade unconventional carbon sources such as the refractory organic pollutants, due to the abundance of carbon sources (adsorbed organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon) on the MPs surface. Meanwhile, the stronger adsorption capacity for pollutants also leads to higher pollutant stress (such as antibiotic stress) in plastisphere, which in turn affects the microbiological characteristics of the plastisphere itself, such as carrying more ARGs.","Wang, J; Peng, C; Dai, Yx; Li, Y; Jiao, Sp; Ma, Xd; Liu, Xh; Wang, L",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118920,Water Research
Biodegradable Microplastics Induced The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factors In Soil: A Metagenomic Perspective,"Concerns about the ecological safety of both conventional and biodegradable microplastics have grown due to the inadequate end-of-life treatments of plastics. In this study, the effects of conventional and biodegradable microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) were estimated in a soil microcosm experiment. The gene profiles and their respective bacterial hosts in soil were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing methods. The abundances of ARGs and VFs in polybutylene succinate (PBS) treated soils were statistically higher than the values in the control and conventional microplastic treatments. In comparison with the control, application of conventional microplastics showed negligible effects on ARG and VF profiles in the soil, while biodegradable microplastic amendments significantly changed the compositions of ARGs and VFs. The host-tracking analysis suggested application of microplastics broadened the bacterial hosts of ARGs and VFs in the soil. The percentage of Proteobacteria as ARG hosts increased from 38.5% in the control soils to 58.2% in microplastic exposed soil. The genus Bradyrhizobium was the dominant host of ARGs and VFs in biodegradable microplastic treatments, while conventional microplastics increased the percentages of Pseudomonas as the bacterial hosts. This study enhances the understanding of the effects of conventional and biodegradable microplastics on the propagation and hosts of ARGs and VFs in the terrestrial environment, providing essential insights into the risk assessment and management of plastics.","Song, Rp; Sun, Yz; Li, Xf; Ding, Cf; Huang, Y; Du, Xy; Wang, J",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154596,Science Of The Total Environment
Metagenomic Insights Into Ecological Risk Of Antibiotic Resistome And Mobilome In Riverine Plastisphere Under Impact Of Urbanization,"Microplastics (MPs) are of increasing concern due to their role as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. To date, few studies have explored the influence of anthropogenic activities on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within various riverine MPs, in comparison to their natural counterparts. Here an in-situ incubation was conducted along heavily anthropogenically-impacted Houxi River to characterize the geographical pattern of antibiotic resistome, mobilome and pathogens inhabiting MPs- and leaf-biofilms. The metagenomics result showed a clear urbanization-driven profile in the distribution of ARGs, MGEs and pathogens, with their abundances sharply increasing 4.77 to 19.90 times from sparsely to densely populated regions. The significant correlation between human fecal marker crAssphage and ARG (R2 = 0.67, P=0.003) indicated the influence of anthropogenic activity on ARG proliferation in plastisphere and natural leaf surfaces. And mantel tests and random forest analysis revealed the impact of 17 socio-environmental factors, e.g., population density, antibiotic concentrations, and pore volume of materials, on the dissemination of ARGs. Partial least squares-path modeling further unveiled that intensifying human activities not only directly boosted ARGs abundance but also exerted a comparable indirect impact on ARGs propagation. Furthermore, the polyvinylchloride plastisphere created a pathogen-friendly habitat, harboring higher abundances of ARGs and MGEs, while polylactic acid are not likely to serve as vectors for pathogens in river, with a lower resistome risk score than that in leaf-biofilms. This study highlights the diverse ecological risks associated with the dissemination of ARGs and pathogens in varied MPs, offering insights for the policymaking of usage and control of plastics within urbanization.","Yan, Wf; Bai, R; Zhang, Qh; Jiang, Yh; Chen, G; Zhang, Yr; Wu, Yc; Guo, Xt; Xiao, Y; Zhao, F",10.1016/j.envint.2024.108946,Environment International
Photoaged Microplastics Enhanced The Antibiotic Resistance Dissemination In Wwtps By Altering The Adsorption Behavior Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids,"Growing concerns have raised about the microplastic eco-coronas in the ultraviolet (UV) disinfection wastewater, which accelerated the pollution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the aquatic environment. As the hotspot of gene exchange, microplastics (MPs), especially for the UV-aged MPs, could alter the spread of ARGs in the ecocoronas and affect the resistance of the environment through adsorbing antibiotic resistant plasmids (ARPs). However, the relationship between the MP adsorption for ARPs and ARG spreading characteristics in MP ecocorona remain unclear. Herein, this study explored the distribution of ARGs in the MP eco-corona through in situ investigations of the discharged wastewater, and the adsorption behaviors of MPs for ARPs by in vitro adsorption experiments and in silico calculations. Results showed that the adsorption capacity of MPs for ARPs was enhanced by 42.7-48.0 % and the adsorption behavior changed from monolayer to multilayer adsorption after UV-aging. It was related to the increased surface roughness and oxygen-containing functional groups of MPs under UV treatment. Moreover, the abundance of ARGs in MP eco-corona of UV-treated wastewater was 1.33-1.55 folds higher than that without UV treatment, promoting the proliferation of drug resistance. DFT and DLVO theoretical calculations indicated that the MP-ARP interactions were dominated by electrostatic physical adsorption, endowing the aged MPs with low potential oxygen-containing groups to increase the electrostatic","Guo, Q; Wang, Mj; Jin, Sy; Ni, Hh; Wang, Sp; Chen, J; Zhao, Wl; Fang, Zg; Li, Zh; Liu, Hj",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170824,Science Of The Total Environment
Marine Plastisphere Selectively Enriches Microbial Assemblages And Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Long-Term Cultivation Periods,"Several studies have focused on identifying and quantifying suspended plastics in surface and subsurface seawater. Microplastics (MPs) have attracted attention as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the marine environment. Plastispheres, specific biofilms on MP, can provide an ideal niche to spread more widely through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), thereby increasing risks to ecosystems and human health. However, the microbial communities formed on different plastic types and ARG abundances during exposure time in natural marine environments remain unclear. Four types of commonly used MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were periodically cultured (46, 63, and 102 d) in a field-based marine environment to study the co-selection of ARGs and microbial communities in marine plastispheres. After the first 63 d of incubation (p < 0.05), the initial 16S rRNA gene abundance of microorganisms in the plastisphere increased significantly, and the biomass subsequently decreased. These results suggest that MPs can serve as vehicles for various microorganisms to travel to different environments and eventually provide a niche for a variety of microorganisms. Additionally, the qPCR results showed that MPs selectively enriched ARGs. In particular, tetA, tetQ, sul1, and qnrS were selectively enriched in the PVC-MPs. The abundances of intl1, a mobile genetic element, was measured in all MP types for 46 d (5.22 x 10(-5) +/- 8.21 x 10(-6) copies/16s rRNA gene copies), 63 d (5.90 x 10(-5) +/- 2.49 x 10(-6) copies/16s rRNA gene copies), and 102 d (4.00 x 10(-5) +/- 5.11 x 10(-6) copies/16s rRNA gene copies). Network analysis indicated that ARG profiles co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria. This study suggests that the selection of ARGs and their co-occurring bacteria in MPs could potentially accelerate their transmission through HGT in natural marine plastics.","Kim, H; Yoo, K",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123450,Environmental Pollution
Impact Of Urbanization On Antibiotic Resistome In Different Microplastics: Evidence From A Large-Scale Whole River Analysis,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous in environments and viewed as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Rivers connecting differently urbanized areas contribute a significant input of MPs and ARGs to the environment. However, a systematic study assessing the role of urbanization in shaping antibiotic resistome and mobilome in riverine MPs is lacking. Here, we conducted a large-scale study by placing five types of MPs (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene-fiber, and poly-ethylene-fiber-polyethylene) into Beilun River with an urbanization gradient. A total of 314 ARGs and 57 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in MPs by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ARGs in MPs showed a clear spatial distribution with the abundance increased by 2 orders of magnitude from rural to urban regions. A holistic analysis of 13 socioeconomic and environmental factors identified that urbanization predominantly contributed to both the abundance and potential MGE-mediated dissemination of ARGs in riverine MPs. Notably, MPs types were found to significantly affect the resistome and dissemination risk of ARGs, with polypropylene being the preferred substrates to acquire and spread ARGs. This work highlights the necessity of controlling MPs and ARGs pollution in urban areas and provides an important guide for the future usage and disposal of plastics.","Li, Rl; Zhu, Lj; Yang, K; Li, Hz; Zhu, Yg; Cui, L",10.1021/acs.est.1c01395,Environmental Science & Technology
"Characterization Of Microbial Community, Ecological Functions And Antibiotic Resistance In Estuarine Plastisphere","The plastisphere is a new ecological niche. Compared to the surrounding water, microbial community composition associated with the plastisphere is known to differ with functional consequences. Here, this study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities associated with four types of plastisphere (polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) in an estuarine habitat; assessed ecological functions including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, and determined the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human pathogens. Stochastic processes dominated the community assembly of microorganisms on the plastisphere. Several functional genera related to nutrient cycling were enriched in the plastisphere. Compared to surrounding water and other plastisphere, the abundances of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling genes (cdaR, nosZ and chpy etc.) and ARGs (aadA2-1, cfa and catB8 etc.) were significantly increased in polyvinyl chloride plastisphere. In contrast, the polystyrene plastisphere was the preferred substrate for several pathogens being enriched with for example, Giardia lamblia 18S rRNA, Klebsiella pneumoniae phoE , Legionella spp. 23S rRNA. Overall, this study showed that different plastisphere had different ef-fects on ecological functions and health risk in estuaries and emphasizes the importance of controlling plastic pollution in estuaries. Data from this study support global policy drivers that seek to reduce plastic pollution and offer insights into ecological functions in a new ecological niche of the Anthropocene.","Yang, Ly; Huang, Xr; Neilson, R; Zhou, Syd; Li, Zl; Yang, Xr; Su, Xx",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161322,Science Of The Total Environment
Co-Occurence Of Antibiotics And Micro(Nano)Plastics: A Systematic Review Between 2016-2021,"Pollution by plastics and antibiotics are emerging issues in the areas of the environment and human health. In recent years, several studies have documented the widespread occurrence of plastic particles in various environmental, as well as human, systems, and much research has focused on possible interactions of contaminants with microplastics. Thus, the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics has caused another global problem for the environment and human health. Therefore, we focused on the current knowledge in the field of the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics to summarize the available studies. In this review, categorization of the topics, contaminants details, such as polymer type, size and source, antibiotic type, and other experimental parameters were summarized and discussed. This study indicated that the sorption of antibiotics on plastics, antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of plastics, and antibiotic resistance gene onto plastics were the most frequently examined categories in this field. Moreover, the variability in the procedures and the processes, and the heterogeneity data of reporting between different studies on similar topic make it difficult to bring all results together and produce a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that further research should be done using this systematic study.","Baysal, A; Saygin, H",10.1080/10934529.2022.2082222,Journal Of Environmental Science And Health Part A-Toxic/Hazardous Substances & Environmental Engineering
Absence Of Synergistic Effects Between Microplastics And Copper Ions On The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Within Aquatic Bacteria At The Community Level,"Microplastics and copper ions (Cu2+) are favorable in accelerating the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the plastisphere, however, their combined effects on the ARG spread within the bacterial community of the natural environment were less understood. The influence of microplastic types and Cu2+ concentrations on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs mediated by RP4 plasmid within natural bacterial communities in aquatic environments was investigated. Both biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS) and non-biodegradable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics significantly enhanced the transfer of ARGs, with PBS showing a significant higher effect compared to PVC. Cu2+ also increased transconjugation rates at environmentally relevant concentrations (5 mu g L-1), but higher levels (50 mu g L-1) lead to decreased rates due to severe bacterial cell membrane damage. The transconjugation rates in the presence of both microplastics and Cu2+ were lower than the sum of their individual effects, indicating no synergistic effects between them on transconjugation. Proteobacteria dominated the composition of transconjugates for all the treatment. Transmission electron microscope images and reactive oxygen species production in bacterial cells indicated that the increased contact frequency due to extracellular polymeric substances, combined with enhanced membrane permeability induced by microplastics and Cu2+, accounted for the increasing transconjugation rates. The study provides valuable insight into the potential effects of microplastics and heavy metals on the spread of ARGs from donors to bacterial communities in natural environments.","Lin, L; Sun, Mg; Pan, X; Zhang, Wh; Yang, Y; Yang, Yy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176591,Science Of The Total Environment
Dissecting The Effects Of Co-Exposure To Microplastics And Sulfamethoxazole On Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are frequently and simultaneously detected in sewage and sludge, raising global concerns in recent years. However, their combined effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) remain unclear. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the combinations of different MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate) with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on AD performance and microbial communities. The combined stress slightly decreased the chemical oxygen demand removal rate and total gas/ methane production. Furthermore, co-exposure to MPs and SMX visibly changed the anaerobic sludge morphology during AD, reduced the methanogen activity, and increased the residual propionic acid concentration versus a control. The decreased relative abundances of Euryarchaeota ranged from 1.88% to 4.63% in the experimental groups compared with CK, suggesting that the microbial communities were inevitably affected by exposure to SMX alone or combined MPs/SMX. Interestingly, among the top 50 genera, only two were negatively related to a few antibiotic resistance genes, implying that sludge exhibited widespread multiple resistances. The correlation analysis between the MPs and microbial communities suggested that the MP properties, such as the aperture-desorption of MPs, may impact the microbial variations. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of coexisting MPs/SMX on AD.","Kong, Lj; Shi, Xy",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123562,Journal Of Environmental Management
Genomic Landscape Of Ndm-1 Producing Multidrug-Resistant Providencia Stuartii Causing Burn Wound Infections In Bangladesh,"The increasing antimicrobial resistance in Providencia stuartii (P. stuartii) worldwide, particularly concerning for immunocompromised and burn patients, has raised concern in Bangladesh, where the significance of this infectious opportunistic pathogen had been previously overlooked, prompting a need for investigation. The two strains of P. stuartii (P. stuartii SHNIBPS63 and P. stuartii SHNIBPS71) isolated from wound swab of two critically injured burn patients were found to be multidrug-resistant and P. stuartii SHNIBPS63 showed resistance to all the 22 antibiotics tested as well as revealed the co-existence of bla(VEB-6) (Class A), bla(NDM-1) (Class B), bla(OXA-10) (Class D) beta lactamase genes. Complete resistance to carbapenems through the production of NDM-1, is indicative of an alarming situation as carbapenems are considered to be the last line antibiotic to combat this pathogen. Both isolates displayed strong biofilm-forming abilities and exhibited resistance to copper, zinc, and iron, in addition to carrying multiple genes associated with metal resistance and the formation of biofilms. The study also encompassed a pangenome analysis utilizing a dataset of eighty-six publicly available P. stuartii genomes (n = 86), revealing evidence of an open or expanding pangenome for P. stuartii. Also, an extensive genome-wide analysis of all the P. stuartii genomes revealed a concerning global prevalence of diverse antimicrobial resistance genes, with a particular alarm raised over the abundance of carbapenem resistance gene bla(NDM-1). Additionally, this study highlighted the notable genetic diversity within P. stuartii, significant informations about phylogenomic relationships and ancestry, as well as potential for cross-species transmission, raising important implications for public health and microbial adaptation across different environments.","Mondol, Sm; Islam, I; Islam, Mr; Shakil, Sk; Rakhi, Nn; Mustary, Jf; Amiruzzaman; Gomes, Dj; Shahjalal, Hm; Rahaman, Mm",10.1038/s41598-024-51819-9,Scientific Reports
Detection Of Faecal Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms Attached To Plastics From Human-Impacted Coastal Areas,"Plastics have been proposed as vectors of bacteria as they act as a substrate for biofilms. In this study, we evaluated the abundance of faecal and marine bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from biofilms adhered to marine plastics. Floating plastics and plastics from sediments were collected in coastal areas impacted by human faecal pollution in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Culture and/or molecular methods were used to quantify faecal indicators (E. coli, Enterococci and crAssphage), and the ARGs sulI, tetW and bla(TEM) and the 16S rRNA were detected by qPCR assays. Pseudomonas and Vibrio species and heterotrophic marine bacteria were also analysed via culture-based methods. Results showed that, plastic particles covered by bacterial biofilms, primarily consisted of marine bacteria including Vibrio spp. Some floating plastics had a low concentration of viable E. coli and Enterococci (42% and 67% of the plastics respectively). Considering the median area of the plastics, we detected an average of 68 cfu E. coli per item, while a higher concentration of E. coli was detected on individual plastic items, when compared with 100 ml of the surrounding water. Using qPCR, we quantified higher values of faecal indicators which included inactive and dead microorganisms, detecting up to 2.6 x 10(2) gc mm(-2). The ARGs were detected in 67-88% of the floating plastics and in 29-57% of the sediment plastics with a concentration of up to 6.7 x 10(2) gc mm(-2). Furthermore, enrichment of these genes was observed in biofilms compared with the surrounding water. These results show that floating plastics act as a conduit for both the attachment and transport of faecal microorganisms. In contrast, low presence of faecal indicators was detected in plastic from seafloor sediments. Therefore, although in low concentrations, faecal bacteria, and potential pathogens, were identified in marine plastics, further suggesting plastics act as a reservoir of pathogens and ARGs.","Liang, Hx; De Haan, Wp; Cerdà-Domènech, M; Méndez, J; Lucena, F; García-Aljaro, C; Sanchez-Vidal, A; Ballesté, E",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120983,Environmental Pollution
Combined Environmental Pressure Induces Unique Assembly Patterns Of Micro-Plastisphere Biofilm Microbial Communities In Constructed Wetlands,"The characteristics and dynamics of micro-plastisphere biofilm on the surface of microplastics (MPs) within artificial ecosystems, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), remain unclear, despite these ecosystems' potential to serve as sinks for MPs. This study investigates the dynamic evolution of micro-plastisphere biofilm in CWs, utilizing simulated wastewater containing sulfamethoxazole and humic acid, through physicochemical characterization and metagenomic analysis. Two different types of commercial plastics, including non-degradable polyethylene and degradable polylactic acid, were shredded into MPs and studied. The findings reveal that the types, shape and incubation time of MPs, along with humic acid content in wastewater, affected the quantity and quality of biofilms, such as the biofilm composition, spatial structure and microbial communities. After just 15 days into incubation, numerous microbials were observed on MP samples, with increases in biofilms content and enhanced humification of extracellular polymeric substances over time. Additionally, microbial communities on polylactic acid MPs, or those incubated for longer time, exhibit higher diversity, connectivity and stability, along with reduced vulnerability. Conversely, biofilms on polyethylene MPs were thicker, with higher potential for greenhouse gas emission and increased risk of antibiotic resistance genes. The addition of humic acid demonstrated opposite effects on biofilms across environmental interfaces, possibly due to its dual potential to produce light-induced free radicals and serve as a carbon source. Binning analysis further uncovered a unique assembly pattern of nutrients cycle genes and antibiotic resistance genes, significantly correlated within microplastisphere microbial communities, under the combined stress of nutrition and sulfamethoxazole. These results emphasize the shaping of micro-plastisphere biofilm characteristics by unique environmental conditions in artificial ecosystems, and the need to understand how DOM and other pollutants covary with MP pollution.","Yan, Ph; Zhuang, Sz; Li, Mj; Zhang, J; Wu, Sb; Xie, Hj; Wu, Hm",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121958,Water Research
Detection Of Morganella Morganii Bound To A Plastic Substrate In Surface Water,"Objectives: Around the globe, escalation in rare opportunistic microbial infections is alarming as they are heading steadily towards 'superbug' status. In aquatic ecosystems, plastic fosters multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria and plays a significant role in trafficking antibiotic-resistant genes. In this study, we focused on a multidrug-resistant bacterial strain isolated from microbial communities found on plastic substrates of a volcanic lake in central Italy.Methods: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains were isolated from both raw water and plastic substrates for a comparative investigation using microbiological and molecular methods, and antibiotic susceptibility profiling was performed against a panel of ten antibiotics.Results: Molecular identification and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis confirmed an almost identical sequencing pattern of two isolated strains and their homology with Morganella morganii . Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed their resistance to almost all tested antibiotics. Class 1 integronassociated gene (intI1) and seven antibiotic resistance genes were detected in both strains, confirming their superbug status.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study on the characterization of extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing M. morganii isolated from the biofilm of plastic substrates, depicting the potential toxicity of plastic in harbouring and dispersing virulent, multidrug-resistant, opportunistic human pathogens.","Ferheen, I; Spurio, R; Mancini, L; Marcheggiani, S",10.1016/j.jgar.2023.01.008,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
Integrated Metagenomic And Metatranscriptomic Analysis Reveals Actively Expressed Antibiotic Resistomes In The Plastisphere,"The plastisphere is viewed as a reservoir for the antibiotic resistome in water environments and may pose health concerns. However, the expression profiles of the resistome in the plastisphere are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the occurrence, abundance, and transcriptional level of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), plasmid associated ARGs, microbial composition and ARG bacterial hosts in the plastisphere and urban river water using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and metatranscriptomic sequencing methods. A total of 173 ARGs conferring resistance to 24 major classes of antibiotics commonly prescribed to humans and animals were detected in the plastisphere. Of these, 75 genes were observed with transcriptional activity, indicating that the antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere was not only present, but also actively expressed. Human pathogens belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae were identified as bacterial hosts of ARGs in the plastisphere. The opportunistic and multidrug resistant human pathogen Enterobacter cloacae was found to actively express tetG and confer tetracycline resistance to the plastisphere. Furthermore, 39 genes were identified as plasmid associated ARGs in the plastisphere, displaying a higher proportion of transcript abundance compared with water. The above results suggest that the plastisphere is a hotspot for antibiotic resistome acquisition, expression, and dissemination.","Wu, Xj; Liu, Zb; Li, M; Bartlam, M; Wang, Yy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128418,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Occurrence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Carried By Plastic Waste From Mangrove Wetlands Of The South China Sea,"Plastic waste can carry organisms such as bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) over long distances. However, only few studies have been conducted on the occurrence of ARGs in plastic waste from mangrove wetlands. This study evaluated the distribution characteristics and ecological risks of plastic waste from mangroves in the coastal areas of the South China Sea. The correlation between anthropogenic activity levels and abundance of ARGs in mangroves was evaluated. Transparent and white were the common colors of plastic waste in mangroves. The main shapes of plastic waste were foam and film. The predominant types of plastic waste order were as follows: polyethylene (30.18 %) > polypropylene (27.51 %) > polystyrene (23.59 %). The living area (LA) mangroves had the highest polymer hazard and pollution load indices of 329.09 and 10.03, respectively. The abundance of ARGs (5.08 x 108 copies/g) on the plastic surface in LA mangroves was significantly higher than that of the other mangrove areas. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between ARGs and intI 1 on the plastic surface in mangroves. Correlation analysis between the ARGs and in tI1 showed that most of the ARGs were correlated with intI1 except for msbA. In LA mangroves, sociometric and environmental factors showed significant correlations with the absolute abundances of the four ARGs and intI 1, indicating that anthropogenic activities may lead to changes in the amount of ARGs on plastic surfaces. Furthermore, the ARG storage of plastic waste from different mangroves was as follows: protected areas (3.12 x 1017 copies) > living areas (2.99 x 1017 copies) > aquaculture pond areas (2.88 x 1017 copies). The higher ARG storage of LA mangroves, with the smallest area, greatly increased its ecological risk. The results of this study can provide basic data for processes that influence the distribution of plastic waste and ARGs in mangroves.","Sun, Rk; Li, T; Qiu, Sj; Liu, Y; Wu, Zj; Dai, Zq; Liao, Yt; Chen, X; Chen, Sy; Li, Cy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161111,Science Of The Total Environment
The Resistance Change And Stress Response Mechanisms Of Chlorine-Resistant Bacteria Under Microplastic Stress In Drinking Water Distribution System,"The presence of both chlorine -resistant bacteria (CRB) and microplastics (MPs) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) poses a threat to water quality and human health. However, the risk of CRB bio evolution under the stress of MPs remains unclear. In this study, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were selected to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and it was clear that MPs had the risk of carrying pollutants into DWDS and releasing them. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility test and disinfection experiment confirmed that MPs could enhance the resistance of CRB to antibiotics and disinfectants. Bacteria epigenetic resistance mechanisms were approached from multiple perspectives, including physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as molecular regulatory networks. When MPs enter DWDS, CRB could attach to the surface of MPs and directly interact with both MPs and the antibiotics they release. This attachment process promoted changes in the composition and content of extracellular polymers (EPS) within cells, enhanced surface hydrophobicity, stimulated oxidative stress function, and notably elevated the relative abundance of certain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study elucidates the mechanism by which MPs alter the intrinsic properties of CRB, providing valuable insights into the effective avoidance of biological risks to water quality during CRB evolution.","Zhang, Jn; Ma, Wc; Li, Yb; Zhong, D; Zhou, Zy; Ma, J",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124331,Environmental Pollution
Early And Differential Bacterial Colonization On Microplastics Deployed Into The Effluents Of Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Microbial colonization of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems is a well-known phenomenon; however, there is insufficient knowledge of the early colonization phase. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been proposed as important pathways for MPs entry and transport in aquatic environments and are hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study aimed at characterizing bacterial communities in the early stage of biofilm formation on seven different types of MPs deployed in two different WWTPs effluents as well as measuring the relative abundance of two ARGs (sull and tetM) on the tested MPs. Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA showed significant higher diversity of bacteria on MPs in comparison with free-living bacteria in the WWTP effluents. beta-diversity analysis showed that the in situ environment (sampling site) and hydrophobicity, to a lesser extent, had a role in the early bacterial colonization phase. An early colonization phase MPs-core microbiome could be identified. Furthermore, specific core miaobiomes for each type of polymer suggested that each type might select early attachment of bacteria. Although the tested WWTP effluent waters contained antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) harboring the cull and tetM ARGs, MPs concentrated ARBs harboring the suit gene but not tetM. These results highlight the relevance of the early attachment phase in the development of bacterial biofilms on different types of MP polymers and the role that different types of polymers might have facilitating the attachment of specific bacteria, some of which might carry ARGs.

Metagenomic Insights Into Environmental Risk Of Field Microplastics In An Urban River,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as anthropogenic vectors for the colonization and transportation of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of the microbiome and its environmental risk on field MPs at watershed scale has rarely been explored. Here, geographical distributions of microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) on field MPs at watershed scale were characterized and their potential environmental risks were evaluated based on the data from metagenomic analyzes. The succession of microbial communities on MPs was observed along the watershed, and some ARGs and VFs were significantly enriched on MPs in urban region in comparison with rural region. Potential environmental risk of MPs conducted by Projection Pursuit Regression model in midstream (peri-urban region) and downstream (urban region) were significantly higher than that in upstream (rural region), and exhibit close relationships with MPs concentration and water velocity. Furthermore, our source tracking results demonstrated that the microbiome, ARGs and VFs in urban region MPs were largely derived from rural region MPs. Our results caution us that special attention should be paid to the risks posed by MPs in urban water bodies, and highlight the threat of MPs from rural upstream areas.","Li, Rl; Zhu, Lj; Wang, Yj; Zhu, Yg",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119018,Water Research
Physicochemical Behavior And Ecological Risk Of Biofilm-Mediated Microplastics In Aquatic Environments,"The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments has become the core of environmental pollution. In recent years, the inevitable biological aging process of MPs in natural environments has attracted researchers' attention. Such biofilm-mediated MPs, colonized by microorganisms, affect the physicochemical behavior and potential ecological risks of MPs. Therefore, it is critical to understand the impact of MPs' biofilm formation on the environmental fate and toxicity of MPs. This review presented a comprehensive discussion of the impact of biofilm formation on unique carrier effects and toxicological effects of MPs in aquatic environments. First, the biofilm formation process on MPs, the compositions of microorganisms in biofilm and the factors influencing biofilm formation were briefly summarized. Second, the sorption of pollutants and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes onto biofilm-mediated MPs were discussed. Third, the potential effects of biofilm-mediated MPs on gut microbiota were analyzed. Finally, gaps in the field that require further investigations were put forward. This review emphasized that biofilm-mediated MPs have higher environmental risks and ecotoxicity, which is helpful in providing new insights for pollution prevention and control of new pollutant MPs.","Zhou, Rr; Huang, Xr; Ni, Yt; Ma, Zw; Wei, Hc; Jin, Qj; Ding, Zh",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.107209,Aquatic Toxicology
Bacterial Dynamics Of The Plastisphere Microbiome Exposed To Sub-Lethal Antibiotic Pollution,"Background Antibiotics and microplastics are two major aquatic pollutants that have been associated to antibiotic resistance selection in the environment and are considered a risk to human health. However, little is known about the interaction of these pollutants at environmental concentrations and the response of the microbial communities in the plastisphere to sub-lethal antibiotic pollution. Here, we describe the bacterial dynamics underlying this response in surface water bacteria at the community, resistome and mobilome level using a combination of methods (next-generation sequencing and qPCR), sequencing targets (16S rRNA gene, pre-clinical and clinical class 1 integron cassettes and metagenomes), technologies (short and long read sequencing), and assembly approaches (non-assembled reads, genome assembly, bacteriophage and plasmid assembly).Results Our results show a shift in the microbial community response to antibiotics in the plastisphere microbiome compared to surface water communities and describe the bacterial subpopulations that respond differently to antibiotic and microplastic pollution. The plastisphere showed an increased tolerance to antibiotics and selected different antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Several metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) derived from the antibiotic-exposed plastisphere contained ARGs, virulence factors, and genes involved in plasmid conjugation. These include Comamonas, Chryseobacterium, the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other MAGs belonging to genera that have been associated to human infections, such as Achromobacter. The abundance of the integron-associated ciprofloxacin resistance gene aac(6')-Ib-cr increased under ciprofloxacin exposure in both freshwater microbial communities and in the plastisphere. Regarding the antibiotic mobilome, although no significant changes in ARG load in class 1 integrons and plasmids were observed in polluted samples, we identified three ARG-containing viral contigs that were integrated into MAGs as prophages.Conclusions This study illustrates how the selective nature of the plastisphere influences bacterial response to antibiotics at sub-lethal selective pressure. The microbial changes identified here help define the selective role of the plastisphere and its impact on the maintenance of environmental antibiotic resistance in combination with other anthropogenic pollutants. This research highlights the need to evaluate the impact of aquatic pollutants in environmental microbial communities using complex scenarios with combined stresses. 3sW_WiGiki6wh61j1XWike Video AbstractConclusions This study illustrates how the selective nature of the plastisphere influences bacterial response to antibiotics at sub-lethal selective pressure.

High Concentration Of Ammonia Sensitizes The Response Of Microbial Electrolysis Cells To Tetracycline,"Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a promising technology for effective energy conversion of wastewater organics to biogas. Yet, in swine wastewater treatment, the complex contaminants including antibiotics may affect MEC performance, while the high ammonia concentration might increase this risk by increasing cell membrane permeability. In this work, the responses of MECs on tetracycline (TC) with low and high ammonia loadings (80 and 1000 mg L-1) were fully investigated. The TC of 0 to 1 mg L-1 slightly improved MEC performance in current production and electrochemical characteristics with low ammonia loading, while TC >= 4 mg L(-1 )started to show negative effects. Generally, the high ammonia loading sensitized MECs to TC concentration, inducing the current and COD removal of MECs to sharply decline with TC >= 0.5 mg L-1. The positive effect of high ammonia loading on MEC due to conductivity increase was counteracted with TC >= 1 mg L-1. The co-contamination of TC and ammonia significantly decreased the bioactivity and biomass of anode biofilm. Although the high concentration of co-existing TC and ammonia inhibited MEC performance, the reactors still obtained positive energy feedback. The network analyses indicated that the effluent suspension contributed much to antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transmission, while the microplastics (MPs) in wastewater greatly raised the risks of ARGs spreading. This work systematically examined the synergetic effects of TC and ammonia and the transmission of ARGs in MEC operation, which is conducive to expediting the application of MECs in swine wastewater treatment.","Wang, Ny; Xue, Lf; Ding, Gf; Han, Y; Feng, Yj; Liu, J; Li, N; He, Wh",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119064,Water Research
Beach Sand Plasispheres Are Hotspots For Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potentially Pathogenic Bacteria Even In Beaches With Good Water Quality,"Massive amounts of microplastics are transported daily from the oceans and rivers onto beaches. The ocean plastisphere is a hotspot and a vector for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the plastisphere in beach sand. Thus, to describe whether the microplastics from beach sand represent a risk to human health, we evaluated the bacteriome and abundance of ARGs on microplastic and sand sampled at the drift line and supralittoral zones of four beaches of poor and good water quality. The bacteriome was evaluated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, and the ARGs and bacterial abundances were evaluated by high-throughput real-time PCR. The results revealed that the microplastic harbored a bacterial community that is more abundant and distinct from that of beach sand, as well as a greater abundance of potential human and marine pathogens, especially the microplastics deposited closer to seawater. Microplastics also harbored a greater number and abundance of ARGs. All antibiotic classes evaluated were found in the microplastic samples, but not in the beach sand ones. Additionally, 16 ARGs were found on the microplastic alone, including genes related to multidrug resistance (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, tetM, mdtE and acrB_1), genes that have the potential to rapidly and horizontally spread (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, and tetM), and the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics that are typically regarded as the ultimate line of defense against severe multi-resistant bacterial infections (blaKPC). Lastly, microplastic harbored a similar bacterial community and ARGs regardless of beach water quality. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of microplastics in beach sand worldwide may constitute a potential threat to human health, even in beaches where the water quality is deemed satisfactory. This phenomenon may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs.","Magalhaes, Ea; De Jesus, He; Pereira, Phf; Gomes, As; Dos Santos, Hf",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.123237,Environmental Pollution
Emerging Contaminants And Their Potential Impacts On Estuarine Ecosystems: Are We Aware Of It?,"Emerging contaminants (ECs) are becoming more prevalent in estuaries and constitute a danger to both human health and ecosystems. These pollutants can infiltrate the ecosystem and spread throughout the food chain. Because of the diversified sources and extensive human activities, estuaries are particularly susceptible to increased pollution levels. A thorough review on recent ECs (platinum group elements, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides, siloxanes, liquid crystal monomers, cationic surfactant, antibiotic resistance genes, and microplastics) in estuaries, including their incidence, detection levels, and toxic effects, was performed. The inclusion of studies from different regions highlights the global nature of this issue, with each location having its unique set of contaminants. The diverse range of contaminants detected in estuary samples worldwide underscores the intricacy of ECs. A significant drawback is the scarcity of research on the toxic mechanisms of ECs on estuarine organisms, the prospect of unidentified ECs, warrant research scopes.","Sultan, Mb; Anik, Ah; Rahman, Mm",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115982,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Viral Diversity And Potential Environmental Risk In Microplastic At Watershed Scale: Evidence From Metagenomic Analysis Of Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a new vector for the long-distance transport of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of viral communities attached on MPs and their environmental risk are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the viral diversity and potential risk in five different MPs collected from the Beilun River based on metagenomic analysis. Nearly 2863 million raw reads were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in the identification of 1719 different species of viruses in MPs. Viruses in polypropylene (PP) displayed the highest diversity, with about 250 specific viruses detected. Source tracking of viruses in MPs by the fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking method (FEAST) demonstrated that viruses in upstream and downstream MPs are two major sources of viruses in estuary. Furthermore, the MP-type-dependent potential environmental risk of viruses was significant based on both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) detected in viral metagenomes, and PP was confirmed with the highest potential environmental risk. This study reveals the high diversity and potential environmental risk of viruses in different MPs, and provides an important guidance for future environmental monitoring and understanding the potential risks associated with both viral transmission and MPs pollution.","Li, Rl; Zhu, Lj; Cui, L; Zhu, Yg",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107146,Environment International
"Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Chlortetracycline On The Intestinal Barrier, Gut Microbiota, And Antibiotic Resistome Of Muscovy Ducks (Cairina Moschata)","Antibiotics and microplastics (MPs) have become critical concerns worldwide because of their increasing amount and ecological risks to ecosystems. However, how MPs exposure affects the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in waterfowls remains poorly understood. In this study, Muscovy ducks were exposed to single and combined contamination with polystyrene MPs and chlortetracycline (CTC) for 56 days, and the effects of MPs on CTC bioaccumulation and their risks in duck intestines were investigated. MPs exposure reduced the bioaccumulation of CTC in the intestine and liver of ducks and increased their fecal CTC excretion. MPs exposure caused severe oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and intestinal barrier damages. Microbiome analysis showed that MPs exposure induced microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of Streptococcus and Helicobacter, the increase of which may exacerbate intestinal damages. Co-exposure to MPs and CTC alleviated the intestinal damage by regulating the gut microbiome. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the combined exposure to MPs and CTC increased the abundance of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Megamonas and incidence of total antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially tetracycline ARGs subtypes in the gut microbiota. The results obtained herein provide new insights into the potential risks of polystyrene MPs and antibiotics in waterfowls living in aquatic environments.","Liu, B; Yu, Dy; Ge, Cy; Luo, Xy; Du, Ln; Zhang, Xp; Hui, C",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164050,Science Of The Total Environment
"Metagenomic Insights Into The Potential Risks Of Representative Bio/Non- Degradable Plastic And Non-Plastic Debris In The Upper And Lower Reaches Of Haihe Estuary, China","As vectors for microorganisms and genetic elements, vast amounts of solid wastes, including plastics and non-plastics, enter oceans through estuaries globally. The heterogeneity of microbiomes developed on different types of plastic and non-plastic matrices and their potential environmental risks in field estuarine regions have not been fully explored. Here, microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factors (VFs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) on substrate debris (SD) covering non-biodegradable plastics, biodegradable plastics, and non-plastics were first comprehensively characterized based on metagenomic analyzes (substrate identity). These selected substrates were field-exposed at both ends of the Haihe Estuary, China (geographic location). For substrate identity: conspicu-ously diverse functional gene profiles on different substrates were obtained; the relative gene copies of ARGs, VFs, and MGEs on non-biodegradable plastics were highest at both locations; non-biodegradable plastic matrices recruited the most abundant unique ARGs from ambient waters; the relative abundance of potential bacterial hosts carrying mul-tiple ARGs and VFs (BH-AV) was much higher on non-biodegradable plastic surfaces than on the other two substrates, especially in the coastal water environment. For geographic locations: more abundant specific ARGs, VFs, and MGEs were significantly enriched on SD from the upper estuary; the average relative abundance of identified BH-AV on SD from the upper estuary was 1.99-7.14 folds from the lower estuary. Finally, the results of the Projection Pursuit Re-gression model verified the higher comprehensive potential risks arising from non-biodegradable plastics (substrate identity) and SD from the upstream of the estuary (geographic location). Based on comparative analysis, our results alert us to pay particular attention to ecological risks triggered by conventional non-biodegradable plastics in rivers and coastal environments and highlight the microbiological risk from terrestrial solid waste to the downstream marine environment.","Zhao, Xh; Niu, Zg; Ma, Yz; Zhang, Y; Li, Yn",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164026,Science Of The Total Environment
Does Antifouling Paint Select For Antibiotic Resistance?,"There is concern that heavy metals and biocides contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5-4 weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.

Micro(Nano)Plastics: Unignorable Vectors For Organisms,"Micro(nano)plastics, as emerging contaminants, have attracted worldwide attention. Nowadays, the environmental distribution, sources, and analysis methods and technologies of micro(nano)plastics have been well studied and recognized. Nevertheless, the role of micro(nano)plastic particles as vectors for attaching organisms is not fully understood. In this paper, the role of micro(nano)plastics as vectors, and their potential effects on the ecology are introduced. Micro(nano)plastics could 1) accelerate the diffusion of organisms in the environment, which may result in biological invasion; 2) increase the gene exchange between attached biofllm communities, causing the transfer of pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes; 3) enhance the rate of energy, material and information flow in the environment. Accordingly, the role of microplastics as vectors for organisms should be further evaluated in the future research.","Shen, Mc; Zhu, Y; Zhang, Yx; Zeng, Gm; Wen, Xf; Yi, H; Ye, Sj; Ren, Xy; Song, B",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.01.004,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Solid-Liquid Interface Adsorption Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids Induced By Nanoplastics Aggravates Gene Pollution In Aquatic Ecosystems*,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have been identified as emerging pollutants in water environment; the interactions between antibiotic resistance plasmids (ARPs) and NPs will influence ARG transport in sediments. Herein, the adsorption experiments of a typical ARP onto polystyrene nanoplastics (PS -NPs) in river and lake sediments were conducted to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms and the effects of environmental factors. Results indicated that the adsorption amounts of PS-NPs increased with the dosages while decreased with the particle size of sediments. Multi-layer adsorption of PS-NPs was found to exist mainly in sand and silt sediments, whereas the filling adsorption dominated in the clay. Moreover, the adsorbed PS-NPs enhanced the physisorption of ARPs in sediments through stimulating the intraparticle diffusion of ARPs induced by electrostatic force. Besides, the adsorption amounts of ARPs onto the PS-NPs decreased with the increasing pH and dissolve organic matter due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and competitive adsorption. The ion strength played catalytic roles by increasing the electrostatic attraction and adsorption sites of ARPs on PS-NPs. The adsorbed ARPs in sediments were closely related with the ARGs in extra/intracellular DNA of biofilms, influencing the distribution and proliferation of ARGs largely. The findings indicate that ARG-associated pollution might be enhanced by the solid-liquid interface adsorption induced by NPs, which was controlled by pH, ion strength and dissolve organic matter. This study provides supplementary insights into the roles of NPs as carriers of ARP in sediments, and advances our understanding on the risks of NP-ARG co-occurring contamination in aquatic ecosystems.","Li, Zh; Wang, Mj; Fang, H; Yao, Zc; Liu, Hj; Zhao, Wl; Chen, J",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120456,Environmental Pollution
Potential Risks Of Microplastics Combined With Superbugs: Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria On The Surface Of Microplastics In Mariculture System,"Microplastics have become emerging pollutants and served as potential vectors for harmful bacteria, while rare information on the emergency and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on the surface of microplastics is available. This study investigated the enrichment of ARB, especially multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria (MARS), on the surface of microplastics in mariculture system. Polyethylene terephthalate accounted for the highest proportion (75%) in the collected microplastics. The counts of cultivable ARB in microplastic samples were 6.40 x 10(6)-2.48 x 10(8) cfu/g, which were 100-5000 times higher than those in water samples. The ratios of cultivable ARB to total cultivable bacteria from microplastic samples were higher than those from water samples. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and abundance of cultivable ARB in the microplastic samples was high with the predominant bacterial genera of Vibrio, Muricauda and Ruegeria. Total 160 MARB isolates were obtained and most of isolates were obtained from the microplastic samples. MARB isolates resisting or intermediating to four and three antibiotics accounted for much higher proportions in the microplastic samples, and the higher percentage of antibiotic resistance was to penicillin, sulfafurazole, erythromycin and tetracycline. The dominant multiple antibiotic resistance profile was TET-SFX-ERY-PEN, which accounted for 25.4% in microplastic samples and 23.9% in water samples. In typical MARB isolates, the positive detection rate of ARGs was up to 80.0% in microplastic samples while that was 65.3% in water samples. Five types of class 1 integrons (intI1) associated gene cassette arrays and seven types of gene cassettes were detected in microplastic samples, which were more than those in water samples. These results revealed that microplastics were hazardous pollutants for the enrichment of ARB, especially superbugs, and the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Zhang, Yx; Lu, J; Wu, J; Wang, Jh; Luo, Ym",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109852,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Watershed Urbanization Enhances The Enrichment Of Pathogenic Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In The Water Environment,"Microplastics (MPs) serve as vectors for microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and contribute to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs across various environments. Patterns of microbial communities and ARGs in the biofilm on the surface of MPs, also termed as plastisphere, have become an issue of global concern. Although antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere has been detected, how watershed urbanization affects patterns of potential pathogens and ARGs in the microplastic biofilms is still unclear. Here, we compared the bacterial communities, the interaction between bacterial taxa, pathogenic bacteria, and ARGs between the plastisphere and their surrounding water, and revealed the extensive influence of urbanization on them. Our results showed that bacterial communities and interactions in the plastisphere differed from those in their surrounding water. Microplastics selectively enriched Bacteroidetes from water. In non-urbanized area, the abundance of Oxy-photobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than that in water, while alpha-Proteobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than those in water of urbanized area. Pathogenic bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urbanized area than those in non -urbanized area. MPs selectively enriched ARG-carrying potential pathogens, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, and exhibited a distinct effect on the relative abundance of ARG and pathogens in water with different urbanization levels. We further found ARGs were significantly correlated to MGEs and pathogenic bacteria. These results suggested that MPs would promote the dissemination of ARGs among microbes including pathogenic bacteria, and urbanization would affect the impact of MPs on microbes, pathogens, and ARGs in water. A high level of urbanization could enhance the enrichment of pathogens and ARGs by MPs in aquatic systems and increase microbial risk in aquatic environments. Our findings highlighted the necessity of con-trolling the spread of ARGs among pathogens and the usage of plastic products in ecosystems of urban areas.","Li, H; Luo, Qp; Zhao, S; Zhao, Pq; Yang, Xr; Huang, Qs; Su, Jq",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120185,Environmental Pollution
Uv-Aging Of Microplastics Increases Proximal Arg Donor-Recipient Adsorption And Leaching Of Chemicals That Synergistically Enhance Antibiotic Resistance Propagation,"Despite growing attention to environmental pollution by microplastics (MP), the effects of MP aging on bacterial horizontal gene transfer (HGT) have not been systematically investigated. Here, we used UV-aged polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) to investigate how aging affects antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transfer efficiency from various ARG vectors to recipient bacteria. The adsorption capacity of MP20 (20-day UV-aged PS-MPs) towards E. coli (harboring plasmid-borne bla(TEM-1)), plasmid pET29 (harboring bla(NDM-1)) and phage lambda (cartying the aphA1 ARG) increased by 6.6-, 5.2- and 8.3-fold, respectively, relative to pristine PS-MPs (MP0), due to increased specific surface area and affinity for these ARG vectors. Moreover, MP20 released more organic compounds (TOC 1.6 mg/g-MP20, versus 0.2 mg/g-MP0 in 4 h) -possibly depolymerization byproducts (verified by GC-MS), which induced intracellular ROS generation, increased cell permeability and upregulated HGT associated genes. Accordingly, MP20 enhanced ARG transfer frequency from E. coli, plasmid pET29 and phage lambda (relative to MP0) by 1.3-, 4.7- and 3.5-fold, respectively. The Bliss independence model infers that higher bacterial adsorption and exposure to chemicals released during MP aging synergistically enhanced ARG transfer. This underscores the need to assess the significance of this overlooked phenomenon to the environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other HGT processes.","Yuan, Qb; Sun, Rn; Yu, Pf; Cheng, Y; Wu, Wb; Bao, Jm; Alvarez, Pjj",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127895,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Travertine Deposition Rather Than Tourism Activity Is The Primary Contributor To The Microplastic Risks In Alpine Karst Lakes,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as anthropogenic vectors to form plastisphere, facilitating microbiome colonization and pathogenic dissemination, thus contributing to environmental and health crises across various ecosystems. However, a knowledge gap persists regarding MPs risks and their driving factors in certain unique and vulnerable ecosystems, such as Karst travertine lakes, some of which are renowned World Natural Heritage Sites under ever-increasing tourism pressure. We hypothesized that tourism activities serve as the most important factor of MPs pollution, whereas intrinsic features, including travertine deposition can exacerbate potential environmental risks. Thus, metagenomic approaches were employed to investigate the geographical distribution of the microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and their combined environmental risks in Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong, two famous tourism destinations in Southwest China. The plastisphere risks were higher in Huanglong, contradicting our hypothesis that Jiuzhaigou would face more crucial antibiotic risks due to its higher tourist activities. Specifically, the levels of Lipopolysaccharide Lewis and fosD increased by sevenfold and 20-fold, respectively, from upstream to downstream in Huanglong, whereas in Jiuzhaigou, no significant accrual was observed. Structural equation modeling results showed that travertine deposition was the primary contributor to MPs risks in alpine karstic lakes. Our findings suggest that tourism has low impact on MPs risks, possibly because of proper management, and that travertine deposition might act as an MPs hotspot, emphasizing the importance of considering the unique aspects of travertine lakes in mitigating MPs pollution and promoting the sustainable development of World Natural Heritage Sites.","Zeng, Hy; Wang, Yj; Zhao, Z; Zhu, Dl; Xia, Hx; Wei, Yh; Kuang, Pg; An, Dj; Chen, K; Li, Rl; Lei, Yb; Sun, G",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135192,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Downward Transport Of Naturally-Aged Light Microplastics In Natural Loamy Sand And The Implication To The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Current understanding on the fate and behavior of microplastics (MPs) in complex soil media remains inadequate. We characterized the aging and hetero-aggregation of a MP sampled in farmland soil, and explored its vertical downward transport in natural loamy sand. The MP was identified with FTIR spectrum as polypropylene, a plastic lighter than water. FTIR spectrum combined with SEM imaging confirmed the MP was highly aged, generating colloidal plastic fibers and carbonyl groups. SEM imaging coupled with EDX analysis suggested hetero-aggregation of the MP with soil minerals. Soil leaching tests performed with the clean MP (without soil minerals) (CMP), the raw MP (RMP) (with soil minerals), and the RMP with humic acid (HA) (RMP thorn HA) demonstrated that the mobility was insignificant for the CMP, moderate for the RMP and highest for the RMP thorn HA, resulting in a maximal downward traveling distance of 0 cm, 3-4 cm, and 9-10 cm, respectively. Correlation between the maximal traveling distance and zeta potential of the CMP, RMP, and RMP thorn HA confirmed surface charge as a dominant control on the MP mobility; while the increasing density of the MP, due to hetero-aggregation with soil minerals, was identified as a driving mechanism for its downward transport, despite its intrinsic density lower than water. Occurrence of only the lower-sized rod-shaped plastic fibers at the maximal traveling distance suggested the natural aging, a process leading to plastic vibration and fragmentation, was conducive to plastic translocation. The three explored classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulfonamide) were all detected in the plastic surface, suggesting the MP may function as a potential pathway for the dissemination of ARGs to the deeper soil layer. These findings are important to understand the concentration distribution of both the MPs and ARGs in agriculture impacted soils, a natural reservoir of both emerging contaminants.

Traditional And Biodegradable Plastics Host Distinct And Potentially More Hazardous Microbes When Compared To Both Natural Materials And Planktonic Community,"Microplastic particles are persistent micropollutants that provide a substrate for the growth of bacterial biofilms, posing a threat to the environment. This study explores the changes in commercially available food containers made of conventional (polypropylene PP, polyethylene terephthalate PET), innovative biodegradable (Mater-Bi) and natural (wood and cellulose) materials, when introduced in the surface waters of Lake Maggiore for 43 days. Spectral changes revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy in PET and Mater-Bi, and changes in thermal properties of all human-made material tested indicated a degradation process occurred during environmental exposure. Despite similar bacterial richness, biofilms on PET, PP, and Mater-Bi differed from natural material biofilms and the planktonic community. Human-made material communities showed a higher proportion of potential pathogens, with PET and PP also exhibiting increased abundances of antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, these findings stress the need for dedicated strategies to curb the spread of human-made polymers in freshwaters, including innovative materials that, due to their biodegradable properties, might be perceived less hazardous for the environment.","Sabatino, R; Zullo, R; Di Cesare, A; Piscia, R; Musazzi, S; Corno, G; Volta, P; Galafassi, S",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133166,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastic Properties Affect The Composition Of Prokaryotic And Eukaryotic Communities And Further Regulate The Args In Their Surface Biofilms,"Plastic wastes are ubiquitous in the offshore and oceans with an increasing quantity, and inevitably, microbial commu-nities colonized the plastics to form biofilms, which have become dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the impact of plastic properties including hardness, wettability, and zeta-potential on the biomass, prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities and ARGs in biofilms formed on specific plastics (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) in an estuarine environment. The results showed that, in comparison to PP, more biomass characterized by more dry weight, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total organic car -bon (TOC) was found in biofilms formed on PE and PET, which may be related to their lower surface wettability. Proteobacteria were the dominant prokaryotic phyla, and they accounted for 53.06%, 81.90%, 37.06%, 76.25%, and 54.27% of the total sequences in biofilms on PE, PP, PET, water and sediment, respectively. Ascomycota were the predominant eukaryotic phyla in biofilms, water, and sediment, and their abundances were elevated in biofilms on PP, which accounted for 34.73%. The biofilms on PP had a higher relative abundance of ARGs (3.13) compared to those on PE (2.59) and PET (0.23). Furthermore, both the plastic-biofilm properties (e.g. dry weight, Chl a, and TOC) and microbial communities (e.g., Fungi and Proteobacteria) may be involved in regulating the abundance of ARGs. Moreover, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly correlated to both the absolute and relative abun-dance of ARGs, indicating that MGEs may regulate the migration of ARGs in biofilms. Taken together, this investigation provides the significance of the plastic type, surface properties, and surrounding environments in shaping microbial communities and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics.","Guo, Xp; Chen, Yr; Sun, Xl; Li, Cl; Hou, Lj; Liu, M; Yang, Y",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156362,Science Of The Total Environment
Integrating Multiple Bacterial Phenotypes And Bayesian Network For Analyzing Health Risks Of Pathogens In Plastisphere,"Plastic pollution represents a critical threat to soil ecosystems and even humans, as plastics can serve as a habitat for breeding and refuging pathogenic microorganisms against stresses. However, evaluating the health risk of plastispheres is difficult due to the lack of risk factors and quantification model. Here, DNA sequencing, single-cell Raman-D2O labeling, and transformation assay were used to quantify key risk factors of plastisphere, including pathogen abundance, phenotypic resistance to various stresses (antibiotic and pesticide), and ability to acquire antibiotic resistance genes. A Bayesian network model was newly introduced to integrate these three factors and infer their causal relationships. Using this model, the risk of pathogen in the plastisphere is found to be nearly 3 magnitudes higher than that in free-living state. Furthermore, this model exhibits robustness for risk prediction, even in the absence of one factor. Our framework offers a novel and practical approach to assessing the health risk of plastispheres, contributing to the management of plastic-related threats to human health.","Li, Hz; Li, Wj; Wang, Zj; Chen, Ql; Jensen, Mks; Qiao, M; Cui, L",10.1021/acs.analchem.4c01433,Analytical Chemistry
Soil Contamination In Nearby Natural Areas Mirrors That In Urban Greenspaces Worldwide,"Soil contamination is one of the main threats to ecosystem health and sustainability. Yet little is known about the extent to which soil contaminants differ between urban greenspaces and natural ecosystems. Here we show that urban greenspaces and adjacent natural areas (i.e., natural/semi-natural ecosystems) shared similar levels of multiple soil contaminants (metal(loid)s, pesticides, microplastics, and antibiotic resistance genes) across the globe. We reveal that human influence explained many forms of soil contamination worldwide. Socio-economic factors were integral to explaining the occurrence of soil contaminants worldwide. We further show that increased levels of multiple soil contaminants were linked with changes in microbial traits including genes associated with environmental stress resistance, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis. Taken together, our work demonstrates that human-driven soil contamination in nearby natural areas mirrors that in urban greenspaces globally, and highlights that soil contaminants have the potential to cause dire consequences for ecosystem sustainability and human wellbeing.","Liu, Yr; Van Der Heijden, Mga; Riedo, J; Sanz-Lazaro, C; Eldridge, Dj; Bastida, F; Moreno-Jiménez, E; Zhou, Xq; Hu, Hw; He, Jz; Moreno, Jl; Abades, S; Alfaro, F; Bamigboye, Ar; Berdugo, M; Blanco-Pastor, Jl; De Los Ríos, A; Duran, J; Grebenc, T; Illán, Jg; Makhalanyane, Tp; Molina-Montenegro, Ma; Nahberger, Tu; Peñaloza-Bojacá, Gf; Plaza, C; Rey, A; Rodríguez, A; Siebe, C; Teixido, Al; Casado-Coy, N; Trivedi, P; Torres-Díaz, C; Verma, Jp; Mukherjee, A; Zeng, Xm; Wang, L; Wang, Jy; Zaady, E; Zhou, Xb; Huang, Qy; Tan, Wf; Zhu, Yg; Rillig, Mc; Delgado-Baquerizo, M",10.1038/s41467-023-37428-6,Nature Communications
Single-Cell Analysis Resolves The Cell State Transition And Signaling Dynamics Associated With Melanoma Drug-Induced Resistance,"Continuous BRAF inhibition of BRAF mutant melanomas triggers a series of cell state changes that lead to therapy resistance and escape from immune control before establishing acquired resistance genetically. We used genome-wide transcriptomics and single-cell phenotyping to explore the response kinetics to BRAF inhibition for a panel of patient-derived BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma cell lines. A subset of plastic cell lines, which followed a trajectory covering multiple known cell state transitions, provided models for more detailed biophysical investigations. Markovmodeling revealed that the cell state transitions were reversible and mediated by both Lamarckian induction and nongenetic Darwinian selection of drug-tolerant states. Single-cell functional proteomics revealed activation of certain signaling networks shortly after BRAF inhibition, and before the appearance of drug-resistant phenotypes. Drug targeting those networks, in combination with BRAF inhibition, halted the adaptive transition and led to prolonged growth inhibition in multiple patient-derived cell lines.","Su, Yp; Wei, W; Robert, L; Xue, M; Tsoi, J; Garcia-Diaz, A; Moreno, Bh; Kim, J; Ng, Rh; Lee, Jw; Koya, Rc; Comin-Anduix, B; Graeber, Tg; Ribas, A; Heath, Jr",10.1073/pnas.1712064115,Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America
How Anammox Responds To The Emerging Contaminants: Status And Mechanisms,"Numerous researches have been carried out to study the effects of emerging contaminants in wastewater, such as antibiotics, nanomaterials, heavy metals, and microplastics, on the anammox process. However, they are fragmented and difficult to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effects on reactor performance and the metabolic mechanisms in anammox bacteria. Therefore, this paper overviews the effects on anammox processes by the introduced emerging contaminants in the past years to fulfill such knowledge gaps that affect our perception of the inhibitory mechanisms and limit the optimization of the anammox process. In detail, their effects on anammox processes from the aspects of reactor performance, microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and functional genes related to anammox and nitrogen transformation in anammox consortia are summarized. Furthermore, the metabolic mechanisms causing the cell death of anammox bacteria, such as induction of reactive oxygen species, limitation of substrates diffusion, and membrane binding are proposed. By offering this review, the remaining research gaps are identified, and the potential metabolic mechanisms in anammox consortia are highlighted.","Wang, Y; Ji, Xm; Jin, Rc",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112906,Journal Of Environmental Management
Urbanization And Waterborne Pathogen Emergence In Low-Income Countries: Where And How To Conduct Surveys?,"A major forthcoming sanitary issue concerns the apparition and spreading of drug-resistant microorganisms, potentially threatening millions of humans. In low-income countries, polluted urban runoff and open sewage channels are major sources of microbes. These microbes join natural microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems already impacted by various chemicals, including antibiotics. These composite microbial communities must adapt to survive in such hostile conditions, sometimes promoting the selection of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains by gene transfer. The low probability of exchanges between planktonic microorganisms within the water column may be significantly improved if their contact was facilitated by particular meeting places. This could be specifically the case within biofilms that develop on the surface of the myriads of floating macroplastics increasingly polluting urban tropical surface waters. Moreover, as uncultivable bacterial strains could be involved, analyses of the microbial communities in their whole have to be performed. This means that new-omic technologies must be routinely implemented in low- and middle-income countries to detect the appearance of resistance genes in microbial ecosystems, especially when considering the new 'plastic context.' We summarize the related current knowledge in this short review paper to anticipate new strategies for monitoring and surveying microbial communities.","Bastaraud, A; Cecchi, P; Handschumacher, P; Altmann, M; Jambou, R",10.3390/ijerph17020480,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
Size Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistome And Core Microbiome In An Urban River,"Microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments provide a new ecological niche that facilitates the attachment of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. However, the effect of particle size on the colonization of antibiotic resistomes and pathogens remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study explored the antibiotic resistome and core microbiome on three distinct types of MPs including polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene (PS), with varying sizes of 30, 200, and 3000 mu m by metagenomic sequencing. Our finding showed that the ARG abundances of the PS type increased by 4-folds with increasing particle size from 30 to 3000 mu m, and significant differences in ARG profiles were found across the three MP types. In addition, the concentrations of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were markedly higher in the MPs than in the surrounding water, indicating their enrichment at these artificial interfaces. Notably, several pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Legionella pneumophila were enriched in MP biofilms, and the co-occurrence of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs)/MGEs suggested the presence of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant microbes with potential mobility. Both redundancy analysis (RDA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrated that physicochemical properties such as zeta potential, MP size, and contact angle were the most significant contributors to the antibiotic resistome.

Ecotoxicological Effects Of Microplastics Combined With Antibiotics In The Aquatic Environment: Recent Developments And Prospects,"Both microplastics and antibiotics are commonly found contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics have the ability to absorb antibiotic pollutants in water, but the specific adsorption behavior and mechanism are not fully understood, particularly in relation to the impact of microplastics on toxicity in aquatic environments. We review the interaction, mechanism, and transport of microplastics and antibiotics in water environments, with a focus on the main physical characteristics and environmental factors affecting adsorption behavior in water. We also analyze the effects of microplastic carriers on antibiotic transport and long-distance transport in the water environment. The toxic effects of microplastics combined with antibiotics on aquatic organisms are systematically explained, as well as the effect of the adsorption behavior of microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.

Water Quality And Antibiotic Resistance In The Recreational Waters,"The overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance. This raises concern over the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in waterways and pose health risks of antibiotic resistant infections to water recreationists. The purpose of this study was to monitor water quality, microbial ecology, and antibiotic resistance in water and biofilm on submerged plastics at two public boat launches in southeastern Louisiana. Water and biofilm samples were collected once a month, in triplicate, from two public boat launches in Louisiana, USA for a year. Water quality metrics included nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, phosphate, and organic carbon. Water samples were tested for total and fecal coliform abundance and the presence of ARB. Out of 131 bacterial isolates studied from these two sites, 86% of them tested positive for antibiotic resistance with multidrug resistance. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for sulfonamide (sul2), bacitracin (bacA) and ampicillin (ampA) were identified in bacterial isolates from water and biofilm samples at both sites. Molecular genetic diversity analysis identified distinct taxonomic diversity differences in biofilm bacteria compared to the planktonic bacteria in the surrounding water. Biofilm samples showed increased diversity at the phylum, genus, and species levels.","Andrzejak, T; Raje, H; Lafleur, G; Willis, J; Boopathy, R",10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128546,Bioresource Technology
Adsorbed Sulfamethoxazole Exacerbates The Effects Of Polystyrene (∼2 Μm) On Gut Microbiota And The Antibiotic Resistome Of A Soil Collembolan,"Microplastics pollution in the environment is now receiving worldwide attention; however, the effects of copollution of antibiotics and microplastics on the gut microbiome of globally distributed and functionally important nontarget soil animals remain poorly understood. We studied a model collembolan (Folsomia candida) and found that the ingestion of microplastics (polystyrene, 2-2.9 mu m) substantially altered the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, and the isotopic fractionation in the soil collembolan tissue. Importantly, collembolans exposed to polystyrene microplastics loaded with sulfamethoxazole (MA) presented a distinctive gut microbiome, ARG profile, and isotopic fractionation compared to those exposed to polystyrene alone (MH). We observed that the abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the MA-treated collembolan guts was significantly higher than in the MH and the control treatments. There were also strong interactions between the gut microbiome and ARGs in the collembolan guts. We further found that bacterial beta-diversity correlated significantly with the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in collembolan body tissues. Together, our results indicate that changes in isotopic fractionation and ARG profiles in the collembolan were induced by the changes in gut microbiota and suggest that microplastics from diverse sources may have profound influences on soil fauna and soil food webs.","Xiang, Q; Zhu, D; Chen, Ql; O'Connor, P; Yang, Xr; Qiao, M; Zhu, Yg",10.1021/acs.est.9b04795,Environmental Science & Technology
Microbial Colonizers Of Microplastics In An Arctic Freshwater Lake,"Microplastics (MPs) have been found everywhere as they are easily transported between environmental compartments. Through their transport, MPs are quickly colonized by microorganisms; this microbial community is known as the plastisphere. Here, we characterized the plastisphere of three MPs, one biodegradable (PHB) and two non-biodegradables (HDPE and LDPE), deployed in an Arctic freshwater lake for eleven days. The plastisphere was found to be complex, confirming that about a third of microbial colonizers were viable. Plastisphere was compared to microbial communities on the surrounding water and microbial mats on rocks at the bottom of the lake. Microbial mats followed by MPs showed the highest diversity regarding both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as compared to water samples; however, for fungi, MPs showed the highest diversity of the tested substrates. Significant differences on microbial assemblages on the three tested substrates were found; regarding microbial assemblages on MPs, bacterial genera found in polar environments such as Mycoplana, Erythromicrobium and Rhodoferax with species able to metabolize recalcitrant chemicals were abundant. Eukaryotic communities on MPs were characterized by the presence of ciliates of the genera Stentor, Vorticella and Uroleptus and the algae Cryptomonas, Chlamydomonas, Tetraselmis and Epipyxis. These ciliates normally feed on algae so that the complexity of these assemblages may serve to unravel trophic relationships between co-existing taxa. Regarding fungal communities on MPs, the most abundant genera were Betamyces, Cryptococcus, Arrhenia and Paranamyces. MPs, particularly HDPE, were enriched in the sulI and ermB antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which may raise concerns about human health-related issues as ARGs may be transferred horizontally between bacteria. This study highlights the importance of proper waste management and clean-up protocols to protect the environmental health of pristine environments such as polar regions in a context of global dissemination of MPs which may co-transport microorganisms, some of them including ARGs.

Selection For Antimicrobial Resistance In The Plastisphere,"Microplastics and antimicrobials are widespread contaminants that threaten global systems and frequently co-exist in the presence of human or animal pathogens. Whilst the impact of each of these contaminants has been studied in isolation, the influence of this co-occurrence in driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR)1 in microplastic-adhered microbial communities, known as 'the Plastisphere', is not well understood. This review proposes the mechanisms by which interactions between antimicrobials and microplastics may drive selection for AMR in the Plastisphere. These include: 1) increased rates of horizontal gene transfer in the Plastisphere compared with free-living counterparts and natural substrate controls due to the proximity of cells, co-occurrence of environmental microplastics with AMR selective compounds and the sequestering of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes in the biofilm matrix. 2) An elevated AMR selection pressure in the Plastisphere due to the adsorbing of AMR selective or co-selective compounds to microplastics at concentrations greater than those found in surrounding mediums and potentially those adsorbed to comparator particles. 3) AMR selection pressure may be further elevated in the Plastisphere due to the incorporation of antimicrobial or AMR coselective chemicals in the plastic matrix during manufacture. Implications for both ecological functioning and environmental risk assessments are discussed, alongside recommendations for further research.","Stevenson, Em; Buckling, A; Cole, M; Lindeque, Pk; Murray, Ak",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168234,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastics Combined With Tetracycline In Soils Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance In The Enchytraeus Crypticus Microbiome,"Growing evidence suggests that microplastics can adsorb antibiotics and may consequently exacerbate effects on the health of exposed organisms. Our current understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil invertebrates is limited. This study aimed to investigate changes in the microbiome and ARGs in Enchytraeus crypticus following exposure to a soil environment that contained both microplastics and antibiotics. Tetracycline (TC), polyamide (PA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were used to construct microcosms of polluted soil environments (TC, PA, PVC, PA+TC, PVC+TC). The differences in microbiomes and ARGs were determined by bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results show that compared with the Control or microplastics alone treatments, TC was significantly accumulated in E. crypticus when exposed to TC alone or in combination with microplastics (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences about TC accumulation between TC, PA+TC, and PVC+TC treated E. crypticus (P > 0.05). Microplastics and TC significantly disturbed the microbial community, and decreased the microbial alpha diversity of E. crypticus (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between TC, microplastics and their combined exposure treatments, and no toxic synergies on the diversity of E. crypticus microbiome between tetracycline and microplastics in soil environment. All the treatments increased the diversity of ARGs in E. crypticus (39-49 ARGs vs. 25 ARGs of control). In particular, treatments combining PVC and TC or PA and TC exposure resulted in greater ARGs abundance than the treatments when E. crypticus was exposed to PVC, PA or TC alone. These results add to our understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on the ARGs and microbiome of soil invertebrates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Exploring The Dynamics Of Antibiotic Resistome On Plastic Debris Traveling From The River To The Sea Along A Representative Estuary Based On Field Sequential Transfer Incubations,"The environmental risks arising from ubiquitous microplastics or plastic debris (PD) acting as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted widespread attention. Enormous amounts of plastic waste are transported by rivers and traverse estuaries into the sea every year. However, changes in the antibiotic resistome within the plastisphere (the biofilms formed on PD) as PD travels through estuaries are largely unknown. In this study, we performed sequential migration incubations for PD along Haihe Estuary to simulate the natural process of PD floating from rivers to the ocean. Metagenomic sequencing and analysis techniques were used to track microbial communities and antibiotic resistome on migrating PD and in seawater representing the marine environment. The total relative gene copies of ARGs on traveling PD remained stable. As migration between greatly varied waters, additional ARG subtypes were recruited to the plastisphere. Above 80 % ARG subtypes identified in the plastisphere were persistent throughout the migration, and over 30 % of these persistent ARGs were undetected in seawater. The bacterial hosts composition of ARGs on PD progressively altered as transported downstream. Human pathogenic bacteria carrying ARGs (HPBs-ARG) exhibited decreasing trends in abundance and species number during transfer. Individual HPBs-ARG persisted on transferred PD and were absent in seawater samples, comprising Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Based on all detected ARGs and HPBs-ARG, the Projection Pursuit model was applied to synthetically evaluate the potential risks of antibiotic resistance on migrating PD. Diminished risks on PD were observed upon the river -to -sea journey but consistently remained significantly higher than in seawater. The potential risks posed to marine environments by drifting PD as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistance deserve greater attention. Our results provide initial insights into the dynamics or stability of antibiotic resistome on PD crossing distinct aquatic systems in field estuaries.","Zhao, Xh; Niu, Zg; Ma, Yz; Zhang, Y; Li, Ya; Zhang, Rx",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171464,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastics Increase Impact Of Treated Wastewater On Freshwater Microbial Community,"Plastic pollution is a major global concern with several million microplastic particles entering every day freshwater ecosystems via wastewater discharge. Microplastic particles stimulate biofilm formation (plastisphere) throughout the water column and have the potential to affect microbial community structure if they accumulate in pelagic waters, especially enhancing the proliferation of biohazardous bacteria. To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 (intl), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of intl increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles. Likewise, the microbial community on microplastic was more similar to the original wastewater community with increasing microplastic concentrations. Our results show that microplastic particles indeed promote persistence of typical indicators of microbial anthropogenic pollution in natural waters, and substantiate that their removal from treated wastewater should be prioritised.

Photoaging Processes Of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics Enhance The Adsorption Of Tetracycline And Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance,"Microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and microorganism ubiquitously coexist in aquatic environments. MPs inevitably undergo photoaging processes in aquatic environments, affecting the interactions between MPs and antibiotics and the antibiotic resistance of microorganism. In this study, the impact of photoaging processes of MPs on their adsorption behavior of tetracycline (TC) and related formation of antibiotic resistance were investigated. It was found that the photoaging processes significantly increased the adsorption capacity of TC onto MPs, with the Qe increasing from 0.387 to 0.507 mg/g at 288 K and from 0.507 to 0.688 mg/g at 308 K. The site energy distri-bution (SED) analysis further confirmed that the enhanced adsorption capacity was attributed to more high-energy adsorption sites acquired from MPs photoaging processes. Moreover, the enhanced adsorption of TC further facilitated the formation of seven antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetG, tetK) when MPs adsorbed with TC was covered by biofilm. This study helps comprehensively understand the envi-ronmental behaviors of co-existing MPs, antibiotics and microorganisms, providing a theoretical basis for evaluating and mitigating their coexistence risks.","Tian, Yj; Zhu, Jy; Ying, Ch; Luo, Hw; Zhang, Sf; Zhang, Lq; Li, Rn; Li, J",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137820,Chemosphere
"Interaction Of Microplastics With Antibiotics In Aquatic Environment: Distribution, Adsorption, And Toxicity","As two major types of pollutants of emerging concerns, microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics (ATs) coexist in aquatic environments, and their interactions are a source of increasing concern. Therefore, this work examines the interaction mechanisms of MPs and ATs, and the effect of MPs on ATs bioavailability and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) abundance in aquatic environments. First, the mechanisms for ATs adsorption on MPs are summarized, mainly including hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and electrostatic interactions. But other possible mechanisms, such as halogen bonding, CH/p interaction, cation-p interaction, and negative charge-assisted hydrogen bonds, are newly proposed to explain the observed ATs adsorption. Additionally, environmental factors (such as pH, ionic strength, dissolved organic matters, minerals, and aging conditions) affecting ATs adsorption by MPs are specifically discussed. Moreover, MPs could change the bioaccumulation and toxicity of ATs to aquatic organisms, and the related mechanisms on the joint effect are reviewed and analyzed. Furthermore, MPs can enrich ARGs from the surrounding environment, and the effect of MPs on ARGs abundance is evaluated. Finally, research challenges and perspectives for MPs-ATs interactions and related environmental implications are presented. This review will facilitate a better understanding of the environmental fate and risk of both MPs and ATs.","Wang, Yh; Yang, Yn; Liu, X; Zhao, J; Liu, Rh; Xing, Bs",10.1021/acs.est.1c04509,Environmental Science & Technology
Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistant Genes And Pathogens In Face Masks From Coastal Environments,"ABS T R A C T Face masks (FMs) are essential to limit the spread of the coronavirus during pandemic, a considerable of which are accumulated on the coast. However, limited is known about the microbial profile in the biofilm of the face masks (so-called plastisphere) and the impacts of face masks on the surrounding environments. We herein performed face mask exposures to coastal sediments and characterized the microbial community and the anti-biotic resistome. We detected 64 antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) and 12 mobile gene elements (MGEs) in the plastisphere. Significant enrichments were found in the relative abundance of total ARGs in the plastisphere compared to the sediments. In detail, the relative abundance of tetracycline, multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), and phenicol-resistant genes had increased by 5-10 times. Moreover, the relative abundance of specific hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (e.g., Polycyclovorans sp.), pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas oleovorans), and total MGEs significantly increased in the sediments after face mask exposure, which was congruent with the alteration of pH value and metal concentrations in the microcosms.

Conjugative Antibiotic-Resistant Plasmids Promote Bacterial Colonization Of Microplastics In Water Environments,"Both microplastic and bacterial antibiotic resistance have attracted attention worldwide. When microplastics coexist with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), which carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), ARB colonize the surface of microplastics, and a unique biofilm is formed. The ARB and ARGs in biofilms are denser and more difficult to remove. However, studies on the factors influencing the formation of microplastic biofilms are limited. In this study, plasmid RP4, which appeared in wastewater treatment plants, was found to be able to promote irreversible bacterial colonization of microplastics, and the hypothetical reason was conjugative pili expression. Then, the potential conjugative pili synthesis promoter nanoalumina and inhibitor free nitrous acid (FNA) were selected to test this hypothesis. Simultaneously, nanoalumina promoted and FNA inhibited bacterial colonization when RP4 existed. Combined with the gene expression and ATP analysis results, this hypothesis was confirmed, and the mechanism of RP4 on bacterial colonization was related mainly to conjugative pili protein synthesis and intracellular ATP. In this study, the effects of plasmid RP4, nanoalumina, and FNA on the formation of microplastic biofilms were reported, which has a certain reference value for other researchers exploring microplastic biofilms.","Zhang, Gs; Chen, Jp; Li, Wy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128443,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Fumigation Practice Combined With Organic Fertilizer Increase Antibiotic Resistance In Watermelon Rhizosphere Soil,"Chemical fumigants and organic fertilizer are commonly used in facility agriculture to control soil-borne diseases and promote soil health. However, there is a lack of evidence for the effect of non-antibiotic fumigants on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in plant rhizosphere soils. Here, the response of a wide spectrum of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) to dazomet fumigation practice in the rhizosphere soil of watermelon was investigated along its branching, flowering and fruiting growth stages in plastic shelters using high throughput quantitative PCR approach. Our results indicated that soil fumigation combined with organic fertilizer application significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs in the rhizosphere soil of watermelon plant. The positive correlations between the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs suggested that soil fumigation might increase the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) potential of ARGs. This result was further confirmed by the enhanced associations between ARG and MGE subtypes in the networks of fumigation treatments. Moreover, bipartite associations between ARGs/MGEs and microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) revealed a higher percentage of linkage between MGEs and microbial taxa in the fumigated soils. Structural equation model analysis further suggested that the increases in antibiotic resistance after fumigation and organic fertilizer application were mainly driven by MGEs and fungal community. Together, our results provide vital evidence that dazomet fumigation process combined with organic fertilizer in plastic shelters has the great potential to promote ARGs' dissemination in the rhizosphere, and raise cautions of the acquired resistance by soil-borne fungal pathogen and the potential spreading of ARGs along soil-plant continuum.

Microplastics And Chemical Leachates From Plastic Pipes Are Associated With Increased Virulence And Antimicrobial Resistance Potential Of Drinking Water Microbial Communities,"There is increasing recognition of the potential impacts of microplastics (MPs) on human health. As drinking water is the most direct route of human exposure to MPs, there is an urgent need to elucidate MPs source and fate in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Here, we showed polypropylene random plastic pipes exposed to different water quality (chlorination and heating) and environmental (freeze-thaw) conditions accelerated MPs generation and chemical leaching. MPs showed various morphology and aggregation states, and chemical leaches exhibited distinct profiles due to different physicochemical treatments. Based on the physiological toxicity of leachates, oxidative stress level was negatively correlated with disinfection by-products in the leachates. Microbial network analysis demonstrated exposure to leachates (under three treatments) undermined microbial community stability and increased the relative abundance and dominance of pathogenic bacteria. Leachate physical and chemical properties (i.e., MPs abundance, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, total organic carbon, dissolved ECs) exerted significant (p < 0.05) effects on the functional genes related to virulence,antibiotic resistance and metabolic pathways. Notably, chlorination significantly increased correlations among pathogenic bacteria, virulence genes, and antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, this study advances the under-standing of direct and indirect risks of these MPs released from plastic pipes in the DWDS.","Yang, Xx; Zhou, Ys; Xia, R; Liao, Jq; Liu, Jq; Yu, Pf",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132900,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Plastisphere In Lake Waters: Microbial Diversity, Biofilm Structure, And Potential Implications For Freshwater Ecosystems","Once dispersed in water, microplastic (MP) particles are rapidly colonised by aquatic microbes, which can adhere and grow onto solid surfaces in the form of biofilms. This study provides new insights on microbial diversity and biofilm structure of plastisphere in lake waters. By combining Fourier Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing, we investigated the microbial colonization patterns on floating MPs and, for the first time, the occurrence of eukaryotic core members and their possible relations with biofilm-forming bacterial taxa within the plastisphere of four different lakes. Through PCR-based methods (qPCR, LAMP-PCR), we also evaluated the role of lake plastisphere as long-term dispersal vectors of potentially harmful organisms (including pathogens) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in freshwater ecosystems. Consistent variation patterns of the microbial community composition occurred between water and among the plastisphere samples of the different lakes. The eukaryotic core microbiome was mainly composed by typical freshwater biofilm colonizers, such as diatoms (Pennales, Bacillariophyceaea) and green algae (Chlorophyceae), which interact with eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes of different trophic levels. Results also showed that MPs are suitable vectors of biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogens and a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer, likely facilitating antibiotic resistance spread in the environments.","Di Pippo, F; Crognale, S; Levantesi, C; Vitanza, L; Sighicelli, M; Pietrelli, L; Di Vito, S; Amalfitano, S; Rossetti, S",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119876,Environmental Pollution
Microbial Hitchhikers Harbouring Antimicrobial-Resistance Genes In The Riverine Plastisphere,"BackgroundThe widespread nature of plastic pollution has given rise to wide scientific and social concern regarding the capacity of these materials to serve as vectors for pathogenic bacteria and reservoirs for Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARG). In- and ex-situ incubations were used to characterise the riverine plastisphere taxonomically and functionally in order to determine whether antibiotics within the water influenced the ARG profiles in these microbiomes and how these compared to those on natural surfaces such as wood and their planktonic counterparts.ResultsWe show that plastics support a taxonomically distinct microbiome containing potential pathogens and ARGs. While the plastisphere was similar to those biofilms that grew on wood, they were distinct from the surrounding water microbiome. Hence, whilst potential opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Aeromonas) and ARG subtypes (i.e. those that confer resistance to macrolides/lincosamides, rifamycin, sulfonamides, disinfecting agents and glycopeptides) were predominant in all surface-related microbiomes, especially on weathered plastics, a completely different set of potential pathogens (i.e. Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella and Streptococcus) and ARGs (i.e. aminoglycosides, tetracycline, aminocoumarin, fluoroquinolones, nitroimidazole, oxazolidinone and fosfomycin) dominated in the planktonic compartment. Our genome-centric analysis allowed the assembly of 215 Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), linking ARGs and other virulence-related genes to their host. Interestingly, a MAG belonging to Escherichia -that clearly predominated in water- harboured more ARGs and virulence factors than any other MAG, emphasising the potential virulent nature of these pathogenic-related groups. Finally, ex-situ incubations using environmentally-relevant concentrations of antibiotics increased the prevalence of their corresponding ARGs, but different riverine compartments -including plastispheres- were affected differently by each antibiotic.ConclusionsOur results provide insights into the capacity of the riverine plastisphere to harbour a distinct set of potentially pathogenic bacteria and function as a reservoir of ARGs. The environmental impact that plastics pose if they act as a reservoir for either pathogenic bacteria or ARGs is aggravated by the persistence of plastics in the environment due to their recalcitrance and buoyancy. Nevertheless, the high similarities with microbiomes growing on natural co-occurring materials and even more worrisome microbiome observed in the surrounding water highlights the urgent need to integrate the analysis of all environmental compartments when assessing risks and exposure to pathogens and ARGs in anthropogenically-impacted ecosystems.1SQe33MjkWBo3cdx_C_SmDVideo AbstractConclusionsOur results provide insights into the capacity of the riverine plastisphere to harbour a distinct set of potentially pathogenic bacteria and function as a reservoir of ARGs.

Regulation Of Args Abundance By Biofilm Colonization On Microplastics Under Selective Pressure Of Antibiotics In River Water Environment,"Interactions of microplastics (MPs) biofilm with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics in aquatic environments have made microplastic biofilm an issue of keen scholarly interest. The process of biofilm formation and the degree of ARGs enrichment in the presence of antibiotic-selective pressure and the impact on the microbial community need to be further investigated. In this paper, the selective pressure of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and illumination conditions were investigated to affect the physicochemical properties, biomass, and extracellular polymer secretion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic biofilm. In addition, relative copy numbers of nine ARGs were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In the presence of CIP, microorganisms in the water and microplastic biofilm were more inclined to carry associated ARGs (2-3 times higher), which had a contributing effect on ARGs enrichment. The process of pre-microplastic biofilm formation might have an inhibitory effect on ARGs (total relative abundance up to 0.151) transfer and proliferation compared to the surrounding water (total relative abundance up to 0.488). However, in the presence of CIP stress, microplastic biofilm maintained the abundance of ARGs (from 0.151 to 0.149) better compared to the surrounding water (from 0.488 to 0.386). Therefore, microplastic biofilm act as abundance buffer island of ARGs stabilizing the concentration of ARGs. In addition, high-throughput analyses showed the presence of antibioticresistant (Pseudomonas) and pathogenic (Vibrio) microorganisms in biofilm under different conditions. The above research deepens our understanding of ARGs enrichment in biofilm and provides important insights into the ecological risks of interactions between ARGs, antibiotics, and microplastic biofilm.","Zheng, Zj; Wang, Xl; Zhang, Wz; Wang, L; Lyu, H; Tang, Jc",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120402,Journal Of Environmental Management
Comparison Of Pristine And Aged Poly-L-Lactic Acid And Polyethylene Terephthalate As Microbe Carriers In Surface Water: Displaying Apparent Differences,"Microplastics (MPs) in water environment are potential carriers for many substances. In this study, pristine degradable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and non-degradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs and their UVaged counterparts were exposed to the Yuhangtang River (Y-River). The results showed that the surface morphology and structure of all MPs markedly changed after exposure. Oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrophilicity of aged MPs were higher compared with their pristine counterparts, and further increased after river exposure. The content of extracellular polymers (EPS) of biofilms on MPs increased with the exposure time, and was higher on aged MPs than on pristine ones. Similar results were obtained for most antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between pristine and aged MPs, and ARGs were positively related to pathogens. Dominant bacteria on all MPs were Proteobacteria (51.3 %-81.1 %), Chloroflexi (5.2 %-20.9 %) and Firmicutes (0.4 %-15.9 %), which markedly differed from the Y-River community. Aged MPs could enrich more microbes but relatively fewer bacterial species than pristine MPs, and higher enrichment and species diversity were observed on PLLA compared with PET. This study demonstrates that MPs are highly effective carriers for microbes, and the results provide valuable insights for evaluating the potential impact of bio-MPs on aquatic ecological environment.","Zhao, Jq; Wang, H; Zheng, L; Wang, Q; Song, Yl",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.136014,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
Impact Of Aging Of Primary And Secondary Polystyrene Nanoplastics On The Transmission Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Digestion,"Sewage sludge is a significant reservoir of nano/microplastics (NPs/MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Research has revealed that NPs/MPs may exert an inhibitory effect on anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge. Moreover, NPs/MPs can influence microbial community diversity and composition, potentially increasing ARGs dissemination. The morphological changes to NPs/MPs surface due to aging contribute to modifying hydrophobic properties. To date, there is limited comprehension regarding how various surface properties of NPs influence ARGs dissemination during AD. This study investigated the impact of primary aged/non-aged and secondary aged/non-aged polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) propagation during AD. The findings indicated that the UV-aging process resulted in surface oxidation and distinct morphological characteristics in both primary and secondary PSNPs, while the surface oxidation effect was more pronounced in the secondary aged PSNPs. High concentrations (150 mu g/L) of primary and secondary PSNPs inhibited methane production, with secondary PSNPs causing greater inhibition by 16 to 20 % compared to control. In contrast, low concentration (25 mu g/L) had negligible or slightly positive effects on methane production. PSNPs at 150 mu g/L reduced total VFA concentration, indicating an inhibitory effect on the fermentation step in the AD process. Primary and secondary PSNPs exhibited changes in EPS characteristics. ARGs abundance was enriched in reactors amended with PSNPs, with the highest abundance of 8.54 x 105 copies/g sludge observed in the secondary aged PSNPs (150 mu g/L) reactor. Reactors exposed to aged PSNPs exhibited a relatively higher abundance of ARGs compared to reactors exposed to non-aged PSNPs. Exposure to PSNPs increased the microbial community diversity within the digesters and triggered the enrichment of Comamonadaceae and Syntrophaceae, belonging to Proteobacteria phylum. On the other hand, archaeal communities tended to shift towards hydrogenotrophic methanogens in PSNPs reactors. The correlation analysis showed that Comamonadaceae were positively correlated with the majority of ARGs and intl1. A positive correlation was observed between MGEs and most ARGs, suggesting that the increased proliferation of ARGs under PSNPs exposure may be linked to the abundance of MGEs, which in turn promotes the growth of hosts carrying ARGs. These findings suggest that aged and non-aged NPs could substantially impact the spread of ARGs and MGEs, which also led to notable alterations in the composition of the microbial community. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted impacts of PSNPs with various characteristics on AD processes, microbial communities, and ARGs proliferation, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive assessments of NPs pollutants in the environment.","Haffiez, N; Kalantar, E; Zakaria, Bs; Azizi, Smm; Farner, Jm; Dhar, Br",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174213,Science Of The Total Environment
Antibiotic Susceptibility Of Plant-Derived Lactic Acid Bacteria Conferring Health Benefits To Human,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) confer health benefits to human when administered orally. We have recently isolated several species of LAB strains from plant sources, such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, and medicinal plants. Since antibiotics used to treat bacterial infection diseases induce the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in intestinal microflora, it is important to evaluate the susceptibility of LAB strains to antibiotics to ensure the safety and security of processed foods. The aim of the present study is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against several plant-derived LAB strains. When aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin (SM), kanamycin (KM), and gentamicin (GM), were evaluated using LAB susceptibility test medium (LSM), the MIC was higher than when using Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium. Etest, which is an antibiotic susceptibility assay method consisting of a predefined gradient of antibiotic concentrations on a plastic strip, is used to determine the MIC of antibiotics world-wide. In the present study, we demonstrated that Etest was particularly valuable while testing LAB strains. We also show that the low susceptibility of the plant-derived LAB strains against each antibiotic tested is due to intrinsic resistance and not acquired resistance. This finding is based on the whole-genome sequence information reflecting the horizontal spread of the drug-resistance genes in the LAB strains.","Noda, M; Danshiitsoodol, N; Inoue, Y; Okamoto, T; Sultana, N; Sugiyama, M",10.1038/s41429-019-0218-4,Journal Of Antibiotics
Polyethylene Microplastics Increase Cadmium Uptake In Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa L.) By Altering The Soil Microenvironment,"Little research has focused on the combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals in soil, especially the mechanism of their interaction. We conducted a 45-day microcosm experiment to test the hypothesis that polyethylene (PE) MPs and cadmium (Cd) had a joint toxicity to lettuce fitness. The effects of MPs at different addition ratios on Cd bioavailability and soil properties were also investigated in the microenvironment of three levels of Cd-contaminated soils. The results showed that the 10% MPs had an adverse impact on the plant biomass and significantly decreased soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC), but significantly increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The presence of MPs increased the soil Cd bioavailability and plant Cd concentrations and accumulations across all three levels of Cd-contaminated soils, which potentially aggregated the combined toxicity. The amounts of the bacterial 16SRNA and the fungal ITSRNA genes displayed a hormesis effect in response to the MP addition ratios while the abundance of Cd resistance genes cadA and czcA increased across all three Cd levels. The regression path analysis indicated that MPs affected shoot Cd concentrations by altering soil properties, which directly and indirectly contributed to the alteration mechanism, while the soil pH, DOC, and Cd bioavailability played core roles. The results suggest that the co-exposure of PE MPs in heavy metal-contaminated soil may therefore increase the toxicity, uptake, accumulation, and bioavailability of heavy metals by altering the properties of the soil microenvironment, which deserves further research.

"Microplastics In Landfill And Leachate: Occurrence, Environmental Behavior And Removal Strategies","Plastic wastes buried in landfill are gradually broken and decomposed into microplastics under physical, chemical and biological effects, bringing environmental risks to the exploitation of waste resources. Landfill leachate as a potential source of environmental microplastics has not good attention. Microplastics in leachate carry toxic and harmful pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes, and these vectors pose greater risks to human and environmental health without systematic treatment. Recently, the main technologies of landfill leachate treatment process include order batch activated sludge process, membrane biological reaction process, flocculation process, combined filtration process, and constructed wetland process. However, there is still little knowledge about microplastic removal of the existing leachate treatment facilities, and some technologies to alleviate the sources of such microplastics should be timely developed. This paper systematically summarizes the occurrence of plastics, microplastics and nanoplastics in leachate and their interactive pollution with other toxic pollutants. Meanwhile, the prospects of their environmental behaviors in landfill and leachate are put forward. The microplastic removal by existing leachate treatment equipment and the limitations and challenges to upgrading process of development and implementation are also discussed. The paper can provide a scientific basis for studying the fate of microplastics in landfill and leachate.","Shen, Mc; Xiong, Wp; Song, B; Zhou, Cy; Almatrafi, E; Zeng, Gm; Zhang, Yx",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135325,Chemosphere
"Antibiotic Sorption Onto Mps In Terrestrial Environment: A Critical Review Of The Transport, Bioaccumulation, Ecotoxicological Effects And Prospects","Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are prevalent contaminants in terrestrial environment. MPs possess the ability to absorb antibiotics, resulting in the formation of complex pollutants. While the accumulation and fate of MPs and antibiotics in marine ecosystems have been extensively studied, their combined pollution behavior in terrestrial environments remains relatively underexplored. This paper describes the sources, migration, and compound pollution of MPs and antibiotics in soil. It reviews the mechanisms of compound toxicity associated with antibiotics and MPs, combining different biological classifications. Moreover, we highlight the factors that influence the effects of MPs as vectors and the critical elements driving the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). These information suggests the potential mitigation measures for MPs contamination from different perspectives to reduce the impact of ARGs-carrying MPs on human health, specifically through transmission via plants, microbes, or terrestrial vertebrates. Finally, we identify gaps in scientific knowledge regarding the interaction between MPs and antibiotics in soil environments, including the need for standardized research methods, multi-dimensional studies on complex ecological effects, and more comprehensive risk assessments of other pollutants on human health. In summary, this paper provides foundational information for assessing their combined toxicity, offers insights into the distribution of these emerging pollutants in soil, and contributes to a better understanding of the environmental impact of these contaminants.","Du, J; Zhan, Lc; Zhang, Gm; Zhou, Qw; Wu, Wh",10.1080/01480545.2024.2433075,Drug And Chemical Toxicology
Are Microplastic Particles A Hotspot For The Spread And The Persistence Of Antibiotic Resistance In Aquatic Systems?,"In the last decade, the study of the origin and fate of plastic debris received great attention, leading to a new and broad awareness of the hazard represented by these particles for the environment and the biota. At the same time, the scientific consideration on the leading role of the environment regarding the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) increased. Both, microplastic particles (MPs) and ARB share pollution sources and, in aquatic systems, MPs could act as a novel ecological niche, favouring the survival of pathogens and ARB. MPs can host a specific microbial biofilm, referred to as plastisphere, phylogenetically different from the surrounding planktonic microbial community and from the biofilm growing on other suspended particles. The plastisphere can influence the overall microbiome of a specific habitat, by introducing and supporting different species and by increasing horizontal gene transfer. In this review we collect and analyse the available studies coupling MPs and antibiotic resistance in water, highlighting knowledge gaps to be filled in order to understand if MPs could effectively act as a carrier of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes, and pose a real threat to human health. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Host Range And Genetic Plasticity Explain The Coexistence Of Integrative And Extrachromosomal Mobile Genetic Elements,"Self-transmissible mobile genetic elements drive horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes. Some of these elements integrate in the chromosome, whereas others replicate autonomously as plasmids. Recent works showed the existence of few differences, and occasional interconversion, between the two types of elements. Here, we enquired on why evolutionary processes have maintained the two types of mobile genetic elements by comparing integrative and conjugative elements (ICE) with extrachromosomal ones (conjugative plasmids) of the highly abundant MPFT conjugative type. We observed that plasmids encode more replicases, partition systems, and antibiotic resistance genes, whereas ICEs encode more integrases and metabolism-associated genes. ICEs and plasmids have similar average sizes, but plasmids are much more variable, have more DNA repeats, and exchange genes more frequently. On the other hand, we found that ICEs are more frequently transferred between distant taxa. We propose a model where the different genetic plasticity and amplitude of host range between elements explain the co-occurrence of integrative and extrachromosomal elements in microbial populations. In particular, the conversion from ICE to plasmid allows ICE to be more plastic, while the conversion from plasmid to ICE allows the expansion of the element's host range.","Cury, J; Oliveira, Ph; De La Cruz, F; Rocha, Epc",10.1093/molbev/msy123,Molecular Biology And Evolution
Combined Effects Of Micro-/Nano-Plastics And Oxytetracycline On The Intestinal Histopathology And Microbiome In Zebrafish (Danio Rerio),"Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that microplastics and oxytetracycline (OTC) affect organisms, but few studies have investigated their combined effects on aquatic organisms. In this study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to single and binary-combined contamination of micro-, nano-sized polystyrene plastics and OTC for 30 days, and the intestinal histopathology, gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of zebrafish were measured. The results showed that the intestinal epithelial damage increase with the decrease of plastic sizes. Nano-sized plastics, OTC and their combined exposure caused intestinal epithelial damage, and coexposure with micro-sized plastics reduced the intestinal damage caused by single OTC exposure. The gut microbial communities were affected by the combined exposure to microplastics and OTC. Compared with the blank control, the relative abundance of Fusobacteria increased 12.7 % and 21.1 % in OTC combined with 45-85 mu m micro-plastics (MOTC) and 40-54 nm nano-plastics (NOTC), respectively, and that of Bacteroidetes increased 26.2 % and 18.6 % in the MOTC and NOTC treatments, respectively. The effects of MOTC and NOTC on the biodiversity of the zebrafish gut microbiome were different; MOTC increased the biodiversity by 11.3 % compared with the blank control, whereas NOTC decreased the biodiversity by 8.8 % compared with the blank control. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in 40-54 nm nano-plastics, MOTC and NOTC treatments was increased 96.9 %, 96.6 % and 68.8 % compared with the control group, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were observed in ARGs characteristics between the micro- and nano-plastics treated groups whether combined with OTC or not. These results are essential to further understand the combined ecotoxicological effects of microor nano-plastics and antibiotics on aquatic organisms.","Yu, Zy; Zhang, L; Huang, Qs; Dong, Sj; Wang, Xh; Yan, Cz",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156917,Science Of The Total Environment
Evidence Of Interspecific Plasmid Uptake By Pathogenic Strains Of Klebsiella Isolated From Microplastic Pollution On Public Beaches,"Microplastic beads are becoming a common feature on beaches, and there is increasing evidence that such microplastics can become colonised by potential human pathogens. However, whether the concentrations and pathogenicity of these pathogens pose a public health risk are still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine realistic environmental concentrations of potential pathogens colonising microplastic beads, and quantify the expression of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Microplastic beads were collected from beaches and a culture-dependent approach was used to determine the concentrations of seven target bacteria (Campylobacter spp.; E. coli; intestinal enterococci; Klebsiella spp.; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Salmonella spp.; Vibrio spp.). All seven target bacteria were detected without the need for a pre-enrichment step; urban sites had higher bacterial concentrations, whilst polymer type had no influence on bacterial concentrations. Klebsiella was the most abundant target bacteria and possessed virulence and ARGs, some of which were present on plasmids from other species, and showed pathogenicity in a Galleria melonella infection model. Our findings demonstrate how pathogen colonised microplastic beads can pose a heightened public health risk at the beach, and highlights the urgency for improved monitoring and enforcement of regulations on the release of microplastics into the environment.","Metcalf, R; Messer, Lf; White, Hl; Ormsby, Mj; Matallana-Surget, S; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132567,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
An Orthogonal And Ph-Tunable Sensor-Selector For Muconic Acid Biosynthesis In Yeast,"Microbes offer enormous potential for production of industrially relevant chemicals and therapeutics, yet the rapid identification of high-producing microbes from large genetic libraries is a major bottleneck in modern cell factory development. Here, we develop and apply a synthetic selection system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that couples the concentration of muconic acid, a plastic precursor, to cell fitness by using the prokaryotic transcriptional regulator BenM driving an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that the sensor-selector does not affect production nor fitness, and find that tuning pH of the cultivation medium limits the rise of nonproducing cheaters. We apply the sensor-selector to selectively enrich for best-producing variants out of a large library of muconic acid production strains, and identify an isolate that produces more than 2 g/L muconic acid in a bioreactor. We expect that this sensor-selector can aid the development of other synthetic selection systems based on allosteric transcription factors.","Snoek, T; Romero-Suarez, D; Zhang, J; Ambri, F; Skjoedt, Ml; Sudarsan, S; Jensen, Mk; Keasling, Jd",10.1021/acssynbio.7b00439,Acs Synthetic Biology
Biofilm Enhances The Interactive Effects Of Microplastics And Oxytetracycline On Zebrafish Intestine,"The enhanced adsorption of pollutants on biofilm-developed microplastics has been proved in many studies, but the ecotoxicological effects of biofilm-developed microplastics on organisms are still unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to original microplastics, biofilm-developed microplastics, original microplastics absorbed with oxytetracycline (OTC), and biofilm-developed microplastics absorbed with OTC for 30 days. The intestinal histological damage, intestinal biomarker response, gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profile of zebrafish were measured to explore the roles of biofilm in the effects of microplastics. The results showed that biofilm-developed microplastics significantly increased the number of goblet cells in intestinal epithelium compared with the control group. The biofilm-developed microplastics also induced the oxidative response in the zebrafish intestines, and biofilm changed the response mode in the combined treatment with OTC. Additionally, the biofilm-developed microplastics caused intestinal microbiome dysbiosis, and induced the abundance of some pathogenic genera increasing by several times compared with the control group and the original microplastics treatments, regardless of OTC adsorption. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in biofilm-developed microplastics increased significantly compared with the control and the original microplastic treatments. This study emphasized the significant influence and unique role of biofilm in microplastic studies.","Yu, Zy; Qiu, Dh; Zhou, T; Zeng, Lq; Yan, Cz",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106905,Aquatic Toxicology
High-Sensitive Determination Of Tetracycline Antibiotics Adsorbed On Microplastics In Mariculture Water Using Pre-Cof/Monolith Composite-Based In-Tube Solid Phase Microextraction On-Line Coupled To Hplc-Ms/Ms,"Microplastics (MPs) act as carriers for organic pollutants (e.g. antibiotics) and microorganisms (e.g. bacteria) in waters, leading to the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, the antibiotics adsorbed on MPs may exacerbate this process. For further research, it is necessary to understand the types and amounts of antibiotics adsorbed on MPs. However, due to the heavy work of MPs collection and sample pretreatment, there is a lack of analytical methods and relevant data. In this study, an in -tube solid phase microextraction (IT-SPME) on-line coupled to HPLC-MS/MS method based on amorphous precursor polymer of three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks/monolith-based composite adsorbent was developed, which could efficiently capture, enrich and analyze tetracycline (TCs) antibiotics. Under the optimal extraction parameters, the developed method was capable of detecting TCs at levels as low as 0.48-1.76 pg. This method was applied to analyze the TCs adsorbed on MPs of different particle sizes in mariculture water for the first time, requiring a minimum amount of MPs of only 1 mg. Furthermore, it was observed that there could be an antagonistic relationship between algal biofilm and TCs loaded on MPs. This approach could open up new possibilities for analyzing pollutants on MPs and support deeper research on MPs.","Pang, Jl; Chen, Hz; Guo, Hg; Lin, Kn; Huang, Sy; Lin, Bc; Zhang, Yb",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133768,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Interactions Between Microplastics And Organic Contaminants: The Microbial Mechanisms For Priming Effects Of Organic Compounds On Microplastic Biodegradation,"The co-presence of plastics and other organic contaminants is pervasive in various ecosystems, particularly in areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. Their interactions inevitably impact the composition and functions of the plastisphere microbiome, which in turn determines the trajectory of these contaminants. Antibiotics are a group of organic contaminants that warrant particular attention due to their wide presence in environments and significant potential to disseminate antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the plastisphere. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of sulfadiazine (SDZ), a prevalent environmental antibiotic, on the composition and function of the plastisphere microbial community inhabiting micro-polyethylene (mPE), one of the most common microplastic contaminants. Our findings indicated that the presence of SDZ increased the overall plastisphere microbial abundance and enriched populations that are capable of degrading both SDZ and mPE. The abundance of Aquabacterium, a dominant plastisphere population that is capable of degrading both SDZ and mPE, increased over the course of SDZ exposure, while another abundant mPE-degrading population, Ketobacter, remained stable. Accordingly, the removal of SDZ was enhanced in the presence of mPE. Moreover, the results further revealed that not only SDZ but also other labile organic contaminants (e.g., aniline and hexane) could accelerate mPE biodegradation through a priming effect. This investigation underscores the complex dynamics among microplastics, organic contaminants, and the plastisphere microbiome, offering insights into the environmental fate of plastic and antibiotic pollutants.","Chen, Zy; Sun, Wm; Wang, Sn; Yang, Jc; Huang, W; Huang, Dy; Jiang, K; Zhang, X; Sun, Xx",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122523,Water Research
Global Microplastics Pollution: A Bibliometric Analysis And Review On Research Trends And Hotspots In Agroecosystems,"The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural ecosystems poses a notable threat to dynamics of soil ecosystems, crop productivity, and global food security. MPs enter agricultural ecosystems from various sources and have considerable impacts on the physiochemical properties soil, soil organisms and microbial communities, and plants. However, the intensity of these impacts can vary with the size, shape, types, and the concentrations of MPs in the soil. Besides, MPs can enter food chain through consummation of crops grown on MPs polluted soils. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1636 publications on the effects of MPs on agricultural ecosystems from 2012 to May 2024. The results revealed a substantial increase in publications over the years, and China, the USA, Germany, and India have emerged as leading countries in this field of research. Social network analysis identified emerging trends and research hotspots. The latest burst keywords were contaminants, biochar, polyethylene microplastics, biodegradable microplastics, antibiotic resistance genes, and quantification. Furthermore, we have summarized the effects of MPs on various components of agricultural ecosystems. By integrating findings from diverse disciplinary perspectives, this study provides a valuable insight into the current knowledge landscape, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions to effectively tackle the intricate challenges associated with MPs pollution in agricultural environments.","Jamil, A; Ahmad, A; Irfan, M; Hou, X; Wang, Y; Chen, Zw; Liu, Xh",10.1007/s10653-024-02274-y,Environmental Geochemistry And Health
Photochemistry Of Microplastics-Derived Dissolved Organic Matter: Reactive Species Generation And Organic Pollutant Degradation,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from microplastics (MPs-DOM) is increasingly recognized as a substantial component of aquatic DOM. The photochemistry of MPs-DOM, essential for understanding its environmental fate and impacts, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the photochemical behaviors of MPs-DOM derived from two common plastics: polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which represent aromatic and aliphatic plastics, respectively. Spectral and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that photoreactions preferentially targeted poly-aromatic compounds within the MPs-DOM, leading to degradation products that predominantly form N-aliphatic/lipid-like substances. This transformation is characterized by decreased aromaticity and unsaturation. Additionally, irradiation of MPs-DOM generated reactive species (RS), including triplet intermediates (3DOM*) and singlet oxygen (1O2), with apparent quantum yields of 0.06-0.16 % and 0.16-0.35 %, respectively-values considerably lower than those for conventional DOM (1.19-1.56 % for 3DOM* and 1.34-1.90 % for 1O2). Despite this, the RS generated from MPs-DOM significantly enhance the degradation of coexisting organic pollutants, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The findings shed light on the photoinduced transformation of MPs-DOM and suggest that MPsDOM functions as a natural photocatalyst, mediating redox reactions of pollutants in sunlit aquatic settings. This highlights its previously underestimated role in natural attenuation and aquatic photochemistry.","Zhang, J; Hou, Xf; Zhang, Kn; Xiao, Qz; Gardea-Torresdey, Jl; Zhou, Xx; Yan, B",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122802,Water Research
Exposure To Bisphenol Compounds Accelerates The Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmid,"Antimicrobial resistance poses the most formidable challenge to public health, with plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer playing a pivotal role in its global spread. Bisphenol compounds (BPs), a group of environmental contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties, are extensively used in various plastic products and can be transmitted to food. However, the impact of BPs on the plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not yet been elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate that BPs could promote the conjugative transfer frequency of RP4-7 and clinically multidrug-resistant plasmids. Furthermore, the promoting effect of BPs on the plasmid transfer was also confirmed in a murine model. Microbial diversity analysis of transconjugants indicated an increase in alpha diversity in the BPAF-treated group, along with the declined richness of some beneficial bacteria and elevated richness of Faecalibaculum rodentium, which might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. The underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced conjugative transfer upon BPAF treatment include exacerbated oxidative stress, disrupted membrane homeostasis, augmented energy metabolism, and the increased expression of conjugation-related genes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential risk associated with the exacerbated dissemination of AMR both in vitro and in vivo caused by BPs exposure.","Yang, Bq; Sun, Jy; Zhu, Sy; Wang, Zq; Liu, Y",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120002,Environmental Research
Interaction Of Microbes With Microplastics And Nanoplastics In The Agroecosystems-Impact On Antimicrobial Resistance,"Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are hotspots for the exchange of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) between different bacterial taxa in the environment. Propagation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health issue that needs special attention concerning horizontal gene transfer (HGT) under micro-nano plastics (MNPs) pressure. Interactions between MNPs and microbes, or mere persistence of MNPs in the environment (either water or soil), influence microbial gene expressions, affecting autochthonous microbiomes, their resistomes, and the overall ecosystem. The adsorption of a range of co-contaminants on MNPs leads to the increased interaction of pollutants with microbes resulting in changes in AMR, virulence, toxin production, etc. However, accurately estimating the extent of MNP infestation in agroecosystems remains challenging. The main limitation in estimating the level of MNPs contamination in agroecosystems, surface and subsurface waters, or sediments is the lack of standardized protocols for extraction of MPs and analytical detection methods from complex high organic content matrices. Nonetheless, recent advances in MPs detection from complex matrices with high organic matter content are highly promising. This review aims to provide an overview of relevant information available to date and summarize the already existing knowledge about the mechanisms of MNP-microbe interactions including the different factors with influence on HGT and AMR. In-depth knowledge of the enhanced ARGs propagation in the environment under the influence of MNPs could raise the needed awareness, about future consequences and emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","Nath, J; De, Jyt; Sur, S; Banerjee, P",10.3390/pathogens12070888,Pathogens
Reduction Of Ultrafiltration Membrane Fouling By The Pretreatment Removal Of Emerging Pollutants: A Review,"Ultrafiltration (UF) processes exhibit high removal efficiencies for suspended solids and organic macromolecules, while UF membrane fouling is the biggest obstacle affecting the wide application of UF technology. To solve this problem, various pretreatment measures, including coagulation, adsorption, and advanced oxidation, for application prior to UF processes have been proposed and applied in actual water treatment processes. Previously, researchers mainly focused on the contribution of natural macromolecular pollutants to UF membrane fouling, while the mechanisms of the influence of emerging pollutants (EPs) in UF processes (such as antibiotics, microplastics, antibiotic resistance genes, etc.) on membrane fouling still need to be determined. This review introduces the removal efficiency and separation mechanism for EPs for pretreatments combined with UF membrane separation technology and evaluates the degree of membrane fouling based on the UF membrane's materials/pores and the structural characteristics of the cake layer. This paper shows that the current membrane separation process should be actively developed with the aim of overcoming specific problems in order to meet the technical requirements for the efficient separation of EPs.","Zhang, Jg; Li, Gt; Yuan, Xc; Li, Pp; Yu, Yf; Yang, Wh; Zhao, S",10.3390/membranes13010077,Membranes
Bacterium-Phage Symbiosis Facilitates The Enrichment Of Bacterial Pathogens And Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In The Plastisphere,"The plastisphere, defined as the ecological niche for microbial colonization of plastic debris, has been recognized as a hotspot of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the interactions between bacteria and phages facilitated by the plastisphere, as well as their impact on microbial risks to public health, remain unclear. Here, we analyzed public metagenomic data from 180 plastisphere and environmental samples, stemming from four different habitats and two plastic types (biodegradable and nonbiodegradable plastics) and obtained 611 nonredundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 4061 nonredundant phage contigs. The plastisphere phage community exhibited decreased diversity and virulent proportion compared to those found in environments. Indexes of phage-host interaction networks indicated significant associations of phages with pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), particularly for biodegradable plastics. Known phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were involved in nutrient metabolism, antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation in the plastisphere, which contributed to enhanced competition and survival of pathogens and ARB hosts. Phages also carried transcriptionally active virulence factor genes (VFGs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and could mediate their horizontal transfer in microbial communities. Overall, these discoveries suggest that plastisphere phages form symbiotic relationships with their hosts, and that phages encoding AMGs and mediating horizontal gene transfer (HGT) could increase the source of pathogens and antibiotic resistance from the plastisphere.","Xia, R; Yin, Xl; Balcazar, Jl; Huang, D; Liao, Jq; Wang, Ds; Alvarez, Pjj; Yu, Pf",10.1021/acs.est.4c08265,Environmental Science & Technology
Polystyrene Nanoplastics Change The Functional Traits Of Biofilm Communities In Freshwater Environment Revealed By Geochip 5.0,"There is an increasing concern regarding the potential effects of nanoplastics (NPs) on freshwater ecosystems. Considering the functional values of biofilms in freshwater, knowledge on whether and to what extent NPs can influence the ecosystem processes of biofilms were still limited. Herein, the freshwater biofilms cultured in lab were exposed to 100 nm polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs) of different dosages (1 and 10 mg/L) for 14 days. Confocal laser scanning microscope observation indicated that biofilms were dominated by filamentous, and spiral algae species and the intensity of extracellular polymeric substances increased under PS-NPs exposure. GeoChip 5.0 analysis revealed that PS-NPs exposure triggered a significant increase in functional genes alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and altered biofilms' functional structure. Furthermore, the abundance of genes involved in the total carbon and nitrogen cycling were increased under PS-NPs exposure. The abundance of nitrogen fixation genes experienced the most pronounced increase (24.4%) under 1 mg/L PS-NPs treatment, consistent with the increase of ammonium in overlying water. Whereas antibiotic resistance genes and those related to photosynthetic pigments production were suppressed. These results provided direct evidence for PS-NPs' effects on the biofilm functions in terms of biogeochemical cycling, improving our understanding of the potentials of NPs on freshwater ecosystems.","Miao, Lz; Guo, S; Wu, J; Adyel, Tm; Liu, Zl; Liu, Sq; Hou, J",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127117,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Source, Occurrence, Migration And Potential Environmental Risk Of Microplastics In Sewage Sludge And During Sludge Amendment To Soil","Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global pollutant. MPs research is mainly concentrated on water, with limited research on MPs in sewage sludge. MPs from various sources are collected into sewage and most of the MPs are trapped in the sludge during the sewage treatment process. Sludge is not only a sink of M Ps, but also a source. Soil amendment with sludge provides nutrients into the soil, but it can also import substantial MPs into the soil, which has certain environmental risks. Therefore. we focused on the MPs in sludge and sludge-amended soil and conducted a literature review to summarize the sources, physical properties and fate of the MPs in sludge, as well as their separation, identification and statistical methods. MPs can accumulate in the soil, influence the properties of the soil, and also migrate, which might result in the pollution of deep soils and groundwater. In addition, the adsorption by MPs of heavy metals, organic pollutants, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes cannot be ignored as sewage sludge generally contains substantial concentrations of these pollutants. They can be adsorbed by the MPs and transferred into the soil with sludge amendment of soil. The combination and interaction of MPs with its adsorbed pollutants might increase environmental risk, further leading to possibility of them being uptaken by plants. The specific long-term risks to the environment caused by MPs in soil with sludge amendment require further exploration and investigation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A Review On Mechanistic Understanding Of Microplastic Pollution On The Performance Of Anaerobic Digestion,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) has emerged as a promising technology for diverting the organic waste from the landfills along with the production of clean energy. AD is a microbial-driven biochemical process wherein the plethora of microbial communities participate in converting the putrescible organic matter into biogas. Never-theless, the AD process is susceptible to the external environmental factors such as presence of physical (microplastics) and chemical (antibiotics, pesticides) pollutants. The microplastics (MPs) pollution has received recent attention due to the increasing plastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. This review was aimed for holistic assessment of impact of MPs pollution on AD process to develop efficient treatment technology. First, the possible pathways of MPs entry into the AD systems were critically evaluated. Further, the recent literature on the experimental studies pertaining to the impact of different types of MPs at different concentrations on the AD process was reviewed. In addition, several mechanisms such as direct exposure of MPs on the microbial cells, indirect impact of MPs through the leaching of toxic chemicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation on AD process were elucidated. Besides, the risk possessed by the increase of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after the AD process due to the MPs stress on microbial communities were discussed. Overall, this review deciphered the severity of MPs pollution on AD process at different levels.","Manu, Mk; Luo, Lw; Kumar, R; Johnravindar, D; Li, Dy; Varjani, S; Zhao, J; Wong, J",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121426,Environmental Pollution
"Climate Warming, Environmental Degradation And Pollution As Drivers Of Antibiotic Resistance","Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge to public health, but human-caused environmental changes have not been widely recognized as its drivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between environmental degradation and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that the former can potentially fuel the latter with significant public health outcomes. We describe that (i) global warming favors horizontal gene transfer, bacterial infections, the spread of drug-resistant pathogens due to water scarcity, and the release of resistance genes with wastewater; (ii) pesticide and metal pollution act as co-selectors of antibiotic resistance mechanisms; (iii) microplastics create conditions promoting and spreading antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria; (iv) changes in land use, deforestation, and environmental pollution reduce microbial diversity, a natural barrier to antibiotic resistance spread. We argue that management of antibiotic resistance must integrate environmental goals, including mitigation of further increases in the Earth's surface temperature, better qualitative and quantitative protection of water resources, strengthening of sewage infrastructure and improving wastewater treatment, counteracting the microbial diversity loss, reduction of pesticide and metal emissions, and plastic use, and improving waste recycling. These actions should be accompanied by restricting antibiotic use only to clinically justified situations, developing novel treatments, and promoting prophylaxis. It is pivotal for health authorities and the medical community to adopt the protection of environmental quality as a part of public health measures, also in the context of antibiotic resistance management.","Rzymski, P; Gwenzi, W; Poniedzialek, B; Mangul, S; Fal, A",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123649,Environmental Pollution
Investigation Of The Distributions And Types Of Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii In Different Departments In A General Hospital,"Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most prevalent strain in hospitals and different clinical departments. Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics and resistance mechanisms of A. baumannii isolated from clinical samples in Shaoxing people's hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University, Shaoxing, China. Patients and Methods: Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from blood, phlegm and skin of the patients hospitalized in different departments as respiratory medicine, plastic surgery and intensive care unit (ICU). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize the isolates. Kirby-Bauer test was used to evaluate antibiotic resistance of the bacteria. The expression of resistance inducing genes was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results were analyzed and compared. Results: Two bacterial types, ST208, and ST218, were identified in all 140 samples. The ST208 mainly came from ICU and department of respiratory medicine, while ST218 from department of plastic surgery; 70.21% of ST208 and 84.78% of ST218 were carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and carbapenem-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB), respectively. Multidrug-resistance genes in CRAB isolated from the hospital mainly included, oxa-23, oxa-5, intl 1 and qace Delta 1-sul 1. Besides, the highest and lowest antibiotic resistance was observed in the strains isolated from blood samples and wounds, respectively. Conclusions: The distribution of AB varies in different clinical departments and samples. In the hospital under study, the main types of AB were ST208 and ST218. The genes which affect the ability of antibiotic-resistance were oxa-23, oxa-51, intl 1 and qace Delta 1-sul 1.","Qian, Ye; Dong, Xj; Wang, Zx; Yang, Gc; Liu, Q",10.5812/jjm.22935,Jundishapur Journal Of Microbiology
Determining The Contribution Of Micro/Nanoplastics To Antimicrobial Resistance: Challenges And Perspectives,"Microorganismscolonizing the surfaces of microplastics form aplastisphere in the environment, which captures miscellaneous substances.The plastisphere, owning to its inherently complex nature, may serveas a Petri dish for the development and disseminationof antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), adding a layer of complexityin tackling the global challenge of both microplastics and ARGs. Increasingstudies have drawn insights into the extent to which the proliferationof ARGs occurred in the presence of micro/nanoplastics, thereby increasingantimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, a comprehensive review isstill lacking in consideration of the current increasingly scatteredresearch focus and results. This review focuses on the spread of ARGsmediated by microplastics, especially on the challenges and perspectiveson determining the contribution of microplastics to AMR. The plastisphereaccumulates biotic and abiotic materials on the persistent surfaces,which, in turn, offers a preferred environment for gene exchange withinand across the boundary of the plastisphere. Microplastics breakingdown to smaller sizes, such as nanoscale, can possibly promote thehorizontal gene transfer of ARGs as environmental stressors by inducingthe overgeneration of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, we alsodiscussed methods, especially quantitatively comparing ARG profilesamong different environmental samples in this emerging field and thechallenges that multidimensional parameters are in great necessityto systematically determine the antimicrobial dissemination risk inthe plastisphere. Finally, based on the biological sequencing data,we offered a framework to assess the AMR risks of micro/nanoplasticsand biocolonizable microparticles that leverage multidimensional AMR-associatedmessages, including the ARGs' abundance, mobility, and potentialacquisition by pathogens.","Luo, Gy; Liang, B; Cui, Hl; Kang, Yy; Zhou, X; Tao, Y; Lu, L; Fan, L; Guo, Jh; Wang, Aj; Gao, Sh",10.1021/acs.est.3c01128,Environmental Science & Technology
In Situ And Individual-Based Analysis Of The Influence Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Escherichia Coli Conjugative Gene Transfer At The Single-Cell Level,"The impact of microplastic particles of micro- and nanometer sizes on microbial horizontal gene transfer (HGT) remains a controversial topic. Existing studies rely on traditional approaches, which analyze population behavior, leading to conflicting conclusions and a limited understanding. The present study addressed these limitations by employing a novel microfluidic chamber system for in situ visualization and precise quantification of the effects of different concentrations of polystyrene (PS) microbeads on microbial HGT at the single-cell level. The statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in the division times of both the donor and recipient bacteria across different PS microbead concentrations. However, as the concentration of PS microbeads increased from 0 to 2000 mg L-1, the average conjugation frequency of Escherichia coli decreased from 0.028 +/- 0.015 to 0.004 +/- 0.003. Our observations from the microfluidic experiments revealed that 500 nm PS microbeads created a barrier effect on bacterial conjugative transfer. The presence of microbeads resulted in reduced contact and interaction between the donor and recipient strains, thereby causing a decrease in the conjugation transfer frequency. These findings were validated by an individual-based modeling framework parameterized by the data from the individual-level microfluidic experiments. Overall, this study offers a fresh perspective and strategy for investigating the risks associated with the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes related to microplastics.","Liu, L; Zhang, Qh; Li, Rt",10.1021/acs.est.3c05476,Environmental Science & Technology
"Recent Advances Towards Micro(Nano)Plastics Research In Wetland Ecosystems: A Systematic Review On Sources, Removal, And Ecological Impacts","In recent years, microplastics/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) have received substantial attention worldwide owing to their wide applications, persistence, and potential risks. Wetland systems are considered to be an important sink for MPs/NPs, which can have potential ecological and environmental effects on the ecosystem. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the sources and characteristics of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, together with a detailed analysis of MP/NP removal and associated mechanisms in wetland systems. In addition, the eco-toxicological effects of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, including plant, animal, and mi-crobial responses, were reviewed with a focus on changes in the microbial community relevant to pollutant removal. The effects of MPs/NPs exposure on conventional pollutant removal by wetland systems and their greenhouse gas emissions are also discussed. Finally, current knowledge gaps and future recommendations are presented, including the ecological impact of exposure to various MPs/NPs on wetland ecosystems and the ecological risks of MPs/NPs associated with the migration of different contaminants and antibiotic resistance genes. This work will facilitate a better understanding of the sources, characteristics, and environmental and ecological impacts of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, and provide a new perspective to promote development in this field.","Zhong, L; Wu, T; Ding, J; Pang, Jw; Zhang, Ly; Ren, Nq; Yang, Ss",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131341,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Are Microplastics In Livestock And Poultry Manure An Emerging Threat To Agricultural Soil Safety?,"Microplastics (MPs) have attracted much attention in recent years, due to the difficulty of degradation and threats to ecological systems and humans. Based on the analysis of 1429 articles on MPs in soil, we found that we know little about the behavior and fate of manure-born MPs from the livestock and poultry production systems to agriculture soils. This review summarizes the analytical methods for sampling, separation, and identification and the occurrence of MPs in livestock and poultry manure, mainly based on 7 surveys related to manure-born MPs. Then, the sources, fate, and environmental risks of MPs in livestock and poultry manure are discussed. MPs, heavy metals, pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes, and persistent organic pollutants are common pollutants in livestock and poultry manure. Worse, manure-born MPs will become smaller, rougher, and more numerous and could easily form more toxic compound pollution after complicated processes of manure treatment, which seriously threatens agricultural soil safety. Finally, an outlook is offered for future research. We hope this article to attract attention to the risks of MPs in livestock and poultry manure and provide a reference for future research.","Long, Yn; Zhang, Y; Zhou, Zy; Liu, Ry; Qiu, Zy; Qiu, Ym; Li, J; Wang, Wm; Li, Xw; Yin, Ls; Wen, Xf",10.1007/s11356-024-31857-6,Environmental Science And Pollution Research
Microbial Communities Colonising Plastics During Transition From The Wastewater Treatment Plant To Marine Waters,"Background Plastics pollution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are two major environmental threats, but potential connections between plastic associated biofilms, the 'plastisphere', and dissemination of AMR genes are not well explored.Results We conducted mesocosm experiments tracking microbial community changes on plastic surfaces transitioning from wastewater effluent to marine environments over 16 weeks. Commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) incubated in wastewater effluent, river water, estuarine water, and in the seawater for 16 weeks, were analysed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Within one week, plastic-colonizing communities shifted from wastewater effluent-associated microorganisms to marine taxa, some members of which (e.g. Oleibacter-Thalassolituus and Sphingomonas spp., on PET, Alcanivoracaceae on PET and PP, or Oleiphilaceae, on all polymers), were selectively enriched from levels undetectable in the starting communities. Remarkably, microbial biofilms were also susceptible to parasitism, with Saprospiraceae feeding on biofilms at late colonisation stages (from week 6 onwards), while Bdellovibrionaceae were prominently present on HDPE from week 2 and LDPE from day 1. Relative AMR gene abundance declined over time, and plastics did not become enriched for key AMR genes after wastewater exposure.Conclusion Although some resistance genes occurred during the mesocosm transition on plastic substrata, those originated from the seawater organisms. Overall, plastic surfaces incubated in wastewater did not act as hotspots for AMR proliferation in simulated marine environments.","Tulloch, Cl; Bargiela, R; Williams, Gb; Chernikova, Tn; Cotterell, Bm; Wellington, Emh; Christie-Oleza, J; Thomas, Dn; Jones, Dl; Golyshin, Pn",10.1186/s40793-024-00569-2,Environmental Microbiome
Microplastics As An Emerging Contaminant Of Concern To Our Environment: A Brief Overview Of The Sources And Implications,"Over the years, it has become evident that microplastics are one of the most important contaminants of concern requiring significant attention. The large abundance of microplastics that are currently in the environment poses potential toxicity risks to all organisms that are exposed to them. Microplastics have been found to affect the physiological and biological processes in marine and terrestrial organisms. As well as being a contaminant of concern in itself, microplastics also have the ability to act as vectors for other contaminants. The potential for microplastics to carry pollutants and transfer them to other organisms has been documented in the literature. Microplastics have also been linked to hosting antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes which poses a significant risk to the current health system. There has been a significant increase in research published surrounding the topic of microplastics over the last 5 years. As such, it is difficult to determine and find up to date and relevant information. This overview paper aims to provide a snapshot of the current and emerging sources of microplastics, how microplastics can act as a contaminant and have toxic effects on a range of organisms and also be a vector for a large variety of other contaminants of concern. The aim of this paper is to act as a tool for future research to reference relevant and recent literature in this field.","Stapleton, Mj; Hai, Fi",10.1080/21655979.2023.2244754,Bioengineered
How Nanoscale Plastics Facilitate The Evolution Of Antibiotic Resistance?,"The plastic can enhance the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), however, the effect of nanoplastics (NPLs) on bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been clearly explained. Herein, we explored the effects and mechanisms of NPLs of different sizes (200 and 600 nm) on the evolution of antibiotic resistance in Serratia marcescens. The results indicated that the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance could be promoted under NPLs exposure, which the median of relative abundance of ARGs was 1.11-1.46 times compared to the treatment without NPLs. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the larger size of NPLs mainly increased the permeability of bacterial cell membranes to efflux antibiotics, thus potentiating antibiotic resistance. While, the smaller NPLs is more than that, its enhanced the expression of antibiotic resistance by modulating bacterial metabolic processes. The genome SNP analysis found that the NPLs could cause the genetic mutation occurrence to alter the membrane transport and metabolism processes, and it increased at a size of 200 nm more than at 600 nm NPLs. Importantly, we demonstrated that the horizontal transfer of ARGs was augmented due to the NPLs could dock to bacterial surface proteins and pull their movement to contact with other bacteria (binding energy of membrane proteins:-8.54 kcal/mol), especially the smaller size. It suggests that NPLs will also contribute to the proliferation of ARGs in the environment. This study provides data for understanding the risk of bacterial resistance.","Xu, Y; Li, Hy; Ding, Yn; Zhang, Dd; Liu, W",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136157,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Microplastics As Emergent Contaminants In Landfill Leachate: Source, Potential Impact And Remediation Technologies","A significant amount of plastic waste is generated each year on a global scale, in which the maximum quantity of plastic waste is typically dumped in landfills in various parts of the world. Moreover, dumping plastic waste in landfills cannot address the issue of proper disposal; it simply delays the process. Exploiting waste resources entails environmental hazards because plastic wastes buried in landfills gradually break down into Microplastics (MPs) due to physical, chemical, and biological effects. The possibility of landfill leachate as a source of MPs in the environment has not received much attention. Without systematic treatment, MPs in leachate increase the risk to human health and environmental health since they contain dangerous and toxic pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes transmitted by leachate vectors. Due to their severe environmental risks, MPs are now widely recognized as emerging pollutants. Therefore, the composition of MPs in landfill leachate and the interaction of MPs with other hazardous contaminants are summarised in this review. The available potential mitigation or treatment methods of MPs in landfill leachate as of now, along with the drawbacks and challenges of the present leachate treatment for eliminating MPs, are described in this review. Since it is unclear how MPs will be removed from the current leachate facilities, it is crucial to develop innovative treatment facilities as quickly as possible. Finally, the areas that require more research to provide complete solutions to the persistent problem of plastic debris are discussed.","Godvinsharmila, V; Shanmugavel, Sp; Tyagi, Vk; Banu, Jr",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118240,Journal Of Environmental Management
Microplastics From Face Masks: Unraveling Combined Toxicity With Environmental Hazards And Their Impacts On Food Safety,"Microplastics (MPs) refer to tiny plastic particles, typically smaller than 5 mm in size. Due to increased mask usage during COVID-19, improper disposal has led to masks entering the environment and releasing MPs into the surroundings. MPs can absorb environmental hazards and transfer them to humans and animals via the food chain, yet their impacts on food safety and human health are largely neglected. This review summarizes the release process of MPs from face masks, influencing factors, and impacts on food safety. Highlights are given to the prevalence of MPs and their combined toxicities with other environmental hazards. Control strategies are also explored. The release of MPs from face masks is affected by environmental factors like pH, UV light, temperature, ionic strength, and weathering. Due to the chemical active surface and large surface area, MPs can act as vectors for heavy metals, toxins, pesticides, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes, and foodborne pathogens through different mechanisms, such as electrostatic interaction, precipitation, and bioaccumulation. After being adsorbed by MPs, the toxicity of these environmental hazards, such as oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and disruption of metabolic energy levels, can be magnified. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on both the combined toxicities of MPs and environmental hazards, as well as their corresponding control strategies. Future research should prioritize understanding the interaction of MPs with other hazards in the food chain, their combined toxicity, and integrating MPs detection and degradation methods with other hazards.","Pei, Ly; Sheng, Ln; Ye, Yl; Sun, Jd; Wang, Js; Sun, Xl",10.1111/1541-4337.70042,Comprehensive Reviews In Food Science And Food Safety
Bacterial Colonisation Dynamics Of Household Plastics In A Coastal Environment,"Accumulation of plastics in the marine environment has widespread detrimental consequences for ecosystems and wildlife. Marine plastics are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including human pathogens, posing potential risks to health. Here, we investigate the effect of polymer type, residence time and estuarine location on bacterial colonisation of common household plastics, including pathogenic bacteria. We submerged five main household plastic types: low-density PE (LDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at an estuarine site in Cornwall (U.K.) and tracked bacterial colonisation dynamics. Using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, we found that bacteria rapidly colonised plastics irrespective of polymer type, reaching culturable densities of up to 1000 cells cm(3) after 7 weeks. Community composition of the biofilms changed over time, but not among polymer types. The presence of pathogenic bacteria, quantified using the insectmodel Galleria mellonella, increased dramatically over a five-week period, with Galleria mortality increasing from 4% in week one to 65% in week five. No consistent differences in virulence were observed between polymer types. Pathogens isolated from plastic biofilms using Galleria enrichment included Serratia and Enterococcus species and they harboured a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings show that plastics in coastal waters are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria independent of polymer type. Further, our results show that marine plastic biofilms become increasingly associated with virulent bacteria over time.","Lear, L; Padfield, D; Dowsett, T; Jones, M; Kay, S; Hayward, A; Vos, M",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156199,Science Of The Total Environment
Temporal Dynamics Of Antibiotic Resistome In The Plastisphere During Microbial Colonization,"The increasing and simultaneous pollution of plastic debris and antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments makes plastisphere a great health concern. However, the development process of antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere is largely unknown, impeding risk assessment associated with plastics. Here, we profiled the temporal dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and microbial composition in the plastisphere from initial microbial colonization to biofilm formation in urban water. A total of 82 ARGs, 12 MGEs, and 63 bacterial pathogens were detected in the plastisphere and categorized as the pioneering, intermediate, and persistent ones. The high number of five MGEs and six ARGs persistently detected in the whole microbial colonization process was regarded as a major concern because of their potential role in disseminating antibiotic resistance. In addition to genomic analysis, D2O-labeled single-cell Raman spectroscopy was employed to interrogate the ecophysiology of plastisphere in a culture-independent way and demonstrated that the plastisphere was inherently more tolerant to antibiotics than bacterioplankton. Finally, by combining persistent MGEs, intensified colonization of pathogenic bacteria, increased tolerance to antibiotic, and potential trophic transfer into a holistic risk analysis, the plastisphere was indicated to constitute a hot spot to acquire and spread antibiotic resistance and impose a long-term risk to ecosystems and human health. These findings provide important insights into the antibiotic resistome and ecological risk of the plastisphere and highlight the necessity for comprehensive surveillance of plastisphere.","Yang, K; Chen, Ql; Chen, Ml; Li, Hz; Liao, H; Pu, Q; Zhu, Yg; Cui, L",10.1021/acs.est.0c04292,Environmental Science & Technology
Microbial Communities In Biosolids-Amended Soils: A Critical Review Of High-Throughput Sequencing Approaches,"Sustainable reuse of treated wastewater sludge or biosolids in agricultural production requires comprehensive understanding of their risks and benefits. Microbes are central mediators of many biosolids-associated risks and benefits, however understanding of their responses to biosolids remains minimal. Application of biosolids to soils amounts to a coalescence of two distinct microbial communities adapted to vastly different matrices. High-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing (HTS) approaches are required to accurately describe the compositional and functional outcomes of this process as they currently provide the highest possible resolution to deal with complex community-scale phenomena. Furthermore, linkage of HTS data to physicochemical and functional data can reveal biotic and abiotic drivers of coalescence, impacts of biosolids-borne contaminants and the collective downstream implications for soil and plant health. Here we review the current body of literature examining microbial communities in biosolids-amended soils using HTS of total community DNA and RNA. We provide a critical synthesis of soil microbial community composition and functional responses, the physical, chemical and biological drivers of these responses, and the influence of three major biosolids-borne anthropogenic contaminants of concern; antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance genes, plastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Finally, we identify methodological limitations and outstanding research questions precluding a holistic understanding of microbial responses in biosolids-amended soils and envision future research whereby sequence-based microbial ecology is integrated with soil, plant, and contaminant data to preserve soil health, support plant productivity, and remediate contaminants.","Reid, Cj; Farrell, M; Kirby, Jk",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124203,Journal Of Environmental Management
Aeromonas Hydrophila Rit668 And Citrobacter Portucalensis Rit669-Potential Zoonotic Pathogens Isolated From Spotted Turtles,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century, and biofilm formation enables bacteria to resist antibiotic at much higher concentrations than planktonic cells. Earlier, we showed that the Gram-negative Aeromonas hydrophila RIT668 and Citrobacter portucalensis RIT669 (closely related to C. freundii NBRC 12681) from infected spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata), formed biofilms and upregulated toxin expression on plastic surfaces, and were predicted to possess multiple antibiotic resistance genes. Here, we show that they each resist several antibiotics in the planktonic phase, but were susceptible to neomycin, and high concentrations of tetracycline and cotrimoxazole. The susceptibility of their biofilms to neomycin and cotrimoxazole was tested using the Calgary device. For A. hydrophila, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 500-1000, and the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) > 1000 mu g/mL, using cotrimoxazole, and MIC = 32.3-62.5, and MBEC > 1000 mu g/mL, using neomycin. For C. freundii MIC = 7.8-15.6, and, MBEC > 1000 mu g/mL, using cotrimoxazole, and MIC = 7.8, and MBEC > 1000 mu g/mL, using neomycin. Both A. hydrophila and C. portucalensis activated an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) dependent biosensor, suggesting that quorum sensing could mediate biofilm formation. Their multidrug resistance in the planktonic form, and weak biofilm eradication even with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, indicate that A. hydrophila and C. portucalensis are potential zoonotic pathogens, with risks for patients living with implants.","Thomas, Sg; Abajorga, M; Glover, Ma; Wengert, Pc; Parthasarathy, A; Savka, Ma; Wadsworth, Cb; Shipman, Pa; Hudson, Ao",10.3390/microorganisms8111805,Microorganisms
A Comprehensive Analysis Of Evolution And Underlying Connections Of Water Research Themes In The 21St Century,"This work aimed to reflect the advancements in water-related science, technology, and policy and shed light on future research opportunities related to water through a systematic overview of Water Research articles published in the first 21.5 years of the 21st century. Specific bibliometric analyses were performed to i) reveal the temporal and spatial trends of water-related research themes and ii) identify the underlying connections between research topics. The results showed that while top topics including wastewater (treatment), drinking water, adsorption, model, biofilm, and bioremediation remained constantly researched, there were clear shifts in topics over the years, leading to the identification of trending-up and emerging research topics. Compared to the first decade of the 21st century, the second decade not only experienced significant uptrends of disinfection by-products, anaerobic digestion, membrane bioreactor, advanced oxidation processes, and pharmaceuticals but also witnessed the emerging popularity of PFAS, anammox, micropollutants, emerging contaminants, desalination, waste activated sludge, microbial community, forward osmosis, antibiotic resistance genes, resource recovery, and transformation products. On top of the temporal evolution, distinct spatial evolution existed in water-related research topics. Microplastics and Covid-19 causing global concerns were hot topics detected, while metagenomics and machine learning were two technical approaches emerging in recent years. These consistently popular, trending-up and emerging research topics would most likely attract continuous/increasing research input and therefore constitute a major part of the prospective water-related research publications.","Chen, Xm; Chen, Hq; Yang, Ly; Wei, W; Ni, Bj",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155411,Science Of The Total Environment
Long-Term And Rapid Evolution In Powdery Mildew Fungi,"The powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphaceae) are globally distributed plant pathogens with a range of more than 10,000 plant hosts. In this review, we discuss the long- and short-term evolution of these obligate biotrophic fungi and outline their diversity with respect to morphology, lifestyle, and host range. We highlight their remarkable ability to rapidly overcome plant immunity, evolve fungicide resistance, and broaden their host range, for example, through adaptation and hybridization. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics, particularly in cereal powdery mildews (genus Blumeria), provided first insights into mechanisms of genomic adaptation in these fungi. Transposable elements play key roles in shaping their genomes, where even close relatives exhibit diversified patterns of recent and ongoing transposon activity. These transposons are ubiquitously distributed in the powdery mildew genomes, resulting in a highly adaptive genome architecture lacking obvious regions of conserved gene space. Transposons can also be neofunctionalized to encode novel virulence factors, particularly candidate secreted effector proteins, which may undermine the plant immune system. In cereals like barley and wheat, some of these effectors are recognized by plant immune receptors encoded by resistance genes with numerous allelic variants. These effectors determine incompatibility (avirulence) and evolve rapidly through sequence diversification and copy number variation. Altogether, powdery mildew fungi possess plastic genomes that enable their fast evolutionary adaptation towards overcoming plant immunity, host barriers, and chemical stress such as fungicides, foreshadowing future outbreaks, host range shifts and expansions as well as potential pandemics by these pathogens.","Kusch, S; Qian, Jz; Loos, A; Kümmel, F; Spanu, Pd; Panstruga, R",10.1111/mec.16909,Molecular Ecology
Recent Advances On Ecological Effects Of Microplastics On Soil Environment,"The mass production and wide application of plastics and their derivatives have led to the release of a large number of discarded plastic products into the natural environment, where they continue to accumulate due to their low recycling rate and long durability. These large pieces of plastic will gradually break into microplastics (<5 mm), which are highly persistent organic pollutants and attract worldwide attention due to their small particle size and potential threats to the ecosystem. Compared with the aquatic system, terrestrial systems such as soils, as sinks for microplastics, are more susceptible to plastic pollution. In this article, we comprehensively summarized the occurrence and sources of microplastics in terrestrial soil, and reviewed the eco-toxicological effects of microplastics in soil ecosystems, in terms of physical and chemical properties of soil, soil nutrient cycling, soil flora and fauna. The influence of microplastics on soil microbial community, and particularly the microbial community on the surface of microplastics, were examined in detail. The compound effects of microplastics and other pollutants, e.g., heavy metals and antibiotics, were addressed. Future challenges of research on microplastics include development of new techniques and standardization for the extraction and qualitative and quantitative analysis of microplastics in soils, toxic effects of microplastics at microbial or even molecular levels, the contribution of microplastics to antibiotic resistance genes migration, and unraveling microorganisms for the degradation of microplastics. This work provides as a better understanding of the occurrence, distribution and potential ecological risks of microplastics in terrestrial soil ecosystems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Emergence Of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci From Vancomycin-Susceptible Enterococci In Hospitalized Patients Under Antimicrobial Therapy,"Objectives: Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens with plastic genomes that evolve, acquire, and transmit antimicrobial-resistant determinants such as vancomycin resistance clusters. While vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as successful nosocomial pathogens, the mechanism by which vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) transform to VRE in hospitalized patients remains understudied. Methods: Genomes of Enterococcus faecium from two critically ill hospitalized patients subjected to multiple antibiotic therapies, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, were investigated. To identify mechanisms of resistance evolution, genomes of vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates were compared. Results: While VSE isolates were initially identified, VRE strains emerged post-vancomycin therapy. Comparative genomics revealed horizontal transmission of mobile genetic elements containing the Tn 1549 transposon, which harbours the vanB -type vancomycin resistance gene cluster. This suggests that broadspectrum antibiotic stress promoted the transfer of resistance-conferring elements, presumably from another gut inhabitant. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies investigating VSE and VRE isolates from the same patient. The mechanism of transmission and the within-patient evolution of vancomycin resistance via mobile genetic elements under antibiotic stress is illustrated. Our findings serve as a foundation for future studies building on this knowledge which can further elucidate the dynamics of antibiotic stress, resistance determinant transmission, and interactions within the gut microbiota.

Assessment Of Antimicrobial Effects Of Food Contact Materials Containing Silver On Growth Of Salmonella Typhimurium,"Food contact materials containing antibacterial properties are progressively appearing in the market. Items intended to provide antimicrobial effects such as increased shelf life and food safety are incorporating silver materials during the manufacture of such products. This study examined the total silver content, release capacity, and antibacterial activity of three different silver-containing food contact materials: plastic food storage containers, a plastic cutting board, and food wrapping paper. Silver content and release were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, and the results showed that, although the amount of silver in each product was similar, migration varied considerably with kind of material and simulant choice. Antimicrobial effect was tested by measuring the growth of Salmonella Typhirhurium during or after exposure to the different food contact materials. The results showed that the food storage containers and wrapping paper delayed the growth of S. Typhimurium under certain conditions, but that these effects were short-lived. The strain of S. Typhimurium used in this study was found to be negative for the presence of tested silver resistance genes. The results of this study suggest that a thorough investigation should be required to show/claim the efficacy of silver containing food contact materials for food safety purposes.

Impact Of Microplastics And Nanoplastics On Livestock Health: An Emerging Risk For Reproductive Efficiency,"Pollution due to microplastics and nanoplastics is one of the major environmental issues of the last decade and represents a growing threat to human and animal health. In aquatic species, there is a large amount of information regarding the perturbation of marine organisms; instead, there are only a few studies focusing on the pathophysiological consequences of an acute and chronic exposure to micro- and nanoplastics in mammalian systems, especially on the reproductive system. There are several studies that have described the damage caused by plastic particles, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammatory response, dysregulation of the endocrine system and accumulation in various organs. In addition to this, microplastics have recently been found to influence the evolution of microbial communities and increase the gene exchange, including antibiotic and metal resistance genes. Special attention must be paid to farm animals, because they produce food such as milk, eggs and meat, with the consequent risk of biological amplification along the food chain. The results of several studies indicate that there is an accumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics in human and animal tissues, with several negative effects, but all the effects in the body have not been ascertained, especially considering the long-term consequences. This review provides an overview of the possible adverse effects of the exposure of livestock to micro- and nanoplastics and assesses the potential risks for the disruption of reproductive physiological functions.","Urli, S; Pause, Fc; Crociati, M; Baufeld, A; Monaci, M; Stradaioli, G",10.3390/ani13071132,Animals
Potential Routes Of Plastics Biotransformation Involving Novel Plastizymes Revealed By Global Multi-Omic Analysis Of Plastic Associated Microbes,"Despite increasing efforts across various disciplines, the fate, transport, and impact of synthetic plastics on the environment and public health remain poorly understood. To better elucidate the microbial ecology of plastic waste and its potential for biotransformation, we conducted a large-scale analysis of all publicly available meta-omic studies investigating plastics (n = 27) in the environment. Notably, we observed low prevalence of known plastic degraders throughout most environments, except for substantial enrichment in riverine systems. This indicates rivers may be a highly promising environment for discovery of novel plastic bioremediation products. Ocean samples associated with degrading plastics showed clear differentiation from non-degrading polymers, showing enrichment of novel putative biodegrading taxa in the degraded samples. Regarding plastisphere pathogenicity, we observed significant enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes on plastics but not of virulence factors. Additionally, we report a co-occurrence network analysis of 10 + million proteins associated with the plastisphere. This analysis revealed a localized sub-region enriched with known and putative plastizymes-these may be useful for deeper investigation of nature's ability to biodegrade man-made plastics. Finally, the combined data from our meta-analysis was used to construct a publicly available database, the Plastics Meta-omic Database (PMDB)-accessible at plasticmdb.org. These data should aid in the integrated exploration of the microbial plastisphere and facilitate research efforts investigating the fate and bioremediation potential of environmental plastic waste.","Ridley, Rs Jr; Conrad, Re; Lindner, Bg; Woo, S; Konstantinidis, Kt",10.1038/s41598-024-59279-x,Scientific Reports
"Occurrence And Fate Of Cecs (Omps, Args And Pathogens) During Decentralised Treatment Of Black Water And Grey Water","Decentralised wastewater treatment is becoming a suitable strategy to reduce cost and environmental impact. In this research, the performance of two technologies treating black water (BW) and grey water (GW) fractions of urban sewage is carried out in a decentralised treatment of the wastewater produced in three office buildings. An Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) treating BW and a Hybrid preanoxic Membrane Bioreactor (H-MBR) containing small plastic carrier elements, treating GW were operated at pilot scale. Their potential on reducing the release of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as Organic Micropollutants (OMPs), Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) and pathogens was studied. After 226 d of operation, a stable operation was achieved in both systems: the AnMBR removed 92.4 +/- 2.5 % of influent COD, and H-MBR removed 89.7 +/- 3.5 %. Regarding OMPs, the profile of compounds differed between BW and GW, being BW the matrix with more compounds detected at higher concentrations (up to mu g L-- 1 ). For example, in the case of ibuprofen the concentrations in BW were 23.63 +/- 3.97 mu g L- 1 , 3 orders of magnitude higher than those detected in GW. The most abundant ARGs were sulfonamide resistant genes ( sul1) and integron class 1 ( intl1) in both BW and GW. Pathogenic bacteria counts were reduced between 1 and 3 log units in the AnMBR. Bacterial loads in GW were much lower than in BW, being no bacterial re-growth observed for the GW effluents after treatment in the H-MBR. None of the selected enteric viruses was detected in GW treatment line.","Rivadulla, M; Lois, M; Elena, Ax; Balboa, S; Suarez, S; Berendonk, Tu; Romalde, Jl; Garrido, Jm; Omil, F",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169863,Science Of The Total Environment
Accumulation Of Antibiotics In The Environment: Have Appropriate Measures Been Taken To Protect Canadian Human And Ecological Health?,"In Canada, every day, contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) are discharged from waste treatment facilities into freshwaters. CECs such as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal care products (PCPs), perand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and microplastics are legally discharged from sewage treatment plants (STPs), water reclamation plants (WRPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs), or other forms of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). In 2006, the Government of Canada established the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) to classify chemicals based on a risk-priority assessment, which ranked many CECs such as PhACs as being of low urgency, therefore permitting these substances to continue being released into the environment at unmonitored rates. The problem with ranking PhACs as a low priority is that CMP's risk management assessment overlooks the long-term environmental and synergistic effects of PhAC accumulation, such as the long-term risk of antibiotic CEC accumulation in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The goal of this review is to specifically investigate antibiotic CEC accumulation and associated environmental risks to human and environmental health, as well as to determine whether appropriate legislative strategies are in place within Canada's governance framework. In this research, secondary data on antibiotic CEC levels in Canadian and international wastewaters, their potential to promote antibiotic-resistant residues, associated environmental short- and long-term risks, and synergistic effects were all considered. Unlike similar past reviews, this review employed an interdisciplinary approach to propose new strategies from the perspectives of science, engineering, and law.","Aladekoyi, O; Siddiqui, S; Hania, P; Hamza, R; Gilbride, K",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116513,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Klebsiella Pneumoniae Lipopolysaccharides Serotype O2Afg Induce Poor Inflammatory Immune Responses Ex Vivo,"Currently, Klebsiella pneumoniae is a pathogen of clinical relevance due to its plastic ability of acquiring resistance genes to multiple antibiotics. During K. pneumoniae infections, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play an ambiguous role as they both activate immune responses but can also play a role in immune evasion. The LPS O2a and LPS O2afg serotypes are prevalent in most multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae strains. Thus, we sought to understand if those two particular LPS serotypes were involved in a mechanism of immune evasion. We have extracted LPS (serotypes O1, O2a and O2afg) from K. pneumoniae strains and, using human monocytes ex vivo, we assessed the ability of those LPS antigens to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We observed that, when human monocytes are incubated with LPS serotypes O1, O2a or O2afg strains, O2afg and, to a lesser extent, O2a but not O1 failed to elicit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which suggests a role in immune evasion. Our preliminary data also shows that nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, a process which regulates an immune response against infections, occurs in monocytes incubated with LPS O1 and, to a smaller extent, with LPS O2a, but not with the LPS serotype O2afg. Our results indicate that multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae expressing LPS O2afg serotypes avoid an initial inflammatory immune response and, consequently, are able to systematically spread inside the host unharmed, which results in the several pathologies associated with this bacterium.","Bulati, M; Busà, R; Carcione, C; Iannolo, G; Di Mento, G; Cuscino, N; Di Gesù, R; Piccionello, Ap; Buscemi, S; Carreca, Ap; Barbera, F; Monaco, F; Cardinale, F; Conaldi, Pg; Douradinha, B",10.3390/microorganisms9061317,Microorganisms
Pathogenic Characteristics And Risk Factors For Eskape Pathogens Infection In Burn Patients,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the clinical manifestations, antimicrobial resistance, molecular characteristics, and risk factors for ESKAPE pathogens infection in burn patients. Methods: A retrospective study of 187 burn patients infected with ESKAPE pathogens was conducted at the Department of Plastic and Burn Surgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (Luzhou, China) from October 2018 to June 2021. All strains were identified using a MicroScan WalkAway 96 Plus System, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the VITEK system or the disk diffusion method. The antimicrobial resistance genes of multi-drug resistant ESKAPE (MDR-ESKAPE) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk factors for ESKAPE infection and MDR-ESKAPE infection. Results: A total of 255 strains were isolated in various types of clinical specimens from 187 burn patients, of which 47.5% were ESKAPE pathogens (121/255). Among these, MDRESKAPE pathogens accounted for 55% (67/121). Additionally, aph3MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEIII, mecA, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaPDC, and blaSHV were the most prevalent genes detected in Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., respectively. The independent risk factors for ESKAPE infection were total body surface area (TBSA) >30-50% (odds ratio [OR] = 10.428; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.047 to 53.108), TBSA >50% (OR = 15.534; 95% CI, 1.489 to 162.021), and parenteral nutrition (OR = 3.597; 95% CI, 1.098 to 11.787). No independent risk factors were found for MDR-ESKAPE infection. Conclusion: Clinical staff should be alert to the risk of nosocomial infection with ESKAPE pathogens in burn patients receiving parenteral nutrition and under TBSA >30%. Full attention should also be paid to the ESKAPE resistance, strict adherence to infection control protocols for the rational use of antimicrobial agents, and enhanced clinical standardization of antimicrobial agents management.","Li, Zy; Yang, Jx; Liu, Sy; Ding, Zx; Hao, Jc; Ding, Yh; Zeng, Zr; Liu, Jb",10.2147/IDR.S338627,Infection And Drug Resistance
Potential Effects Of Micro- And Nanoplastics On Phyllosphere Microorganisms And Their Evolutionary And Ecological Responses,"Plastic pollution is among the most urgent environmental and social challenges of the 21st century, and their influxes in the environment have altered critical growth drivers in all biomes, attracting global concerns. In particular, the consequences of microplastics on plants and their associated soil microorganisms have gained a large audience. On the contrary, how microplastics and nanoplastics (M/NPs) may influence the plant-associated microorganisms in the phyllosphere (i.e., the aboveground portion of plants) is nearly unknown. We, therefore, summarize evidence that may potentially connect M/NPs, plants, and phyllosphere microorganisms based on studies on other analogous contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and nanoparticles. We show seven pathways that may link M/NPs into the phyllosphere environment, and provide a conceptual framework explaining the direct and indirect (soil legacy) effects of M/NPs on phyllosphere microbial communities. We also discuss the adaptive evolutionary and ecological responses, such as acquiring novel resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer and microbial degradation of plastics of the phyllosphere microbial communities, to M/NPs-induced threats. Finally, we highlight the global consequences (e.g., disruption of ecosystem biogeochemical cycling and impaired host-pathogen defense chemistry that can lead to reduced agricultural productivity) of altered plant-microbiome interactions in the phyllosphere in the context of a predicted surge of plastic production and conclude with pending questions for future research priorities. In conclusion, M/NPs are very likely to produce significant effects on phyllosphere microorganisms and mediate their evolutionary and ecological responses.","Adomako, Mo; Yu, Fh",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163760,Science Of The Total Environment
A Fully Sealed Plastic Chip For Multiplex Pcr And Its Application In Bacteria Identification,"Multiplex PCR is an effective tool for simultaneous multiple target detection but is limited by the intrinsic interference and competition among primer pairs when it is performed in one reaction tube. Dividing a multiplex PCR into many single PCRs is a simple strategy to overcome this issue. Here, we constructed a plastic, easy-to-use, fully sealed multiplex PCR chip based on reversible centrifugation for the simultaneous detection of 63 target DNA sequences. The structure of the chip is quite simple, which contains sine-shaped infusing channels and a number of reaction chambers connecting to one side of these channels. Primer pairs for multiplex PCR were sequentially preloaded in the different reaction chambers, and the chip was enclosed with PCR-compatible adhesive tape. For usage, the PCR master mix containing a DNA template is pipetted into the infusing channels and centrifuged into the reaction chambers, leaving the infusing channels filled with air to avoid cross-contamination of the different chambers. Then, the chip is sealed and placed on a flat thermal cycler for PCR. Finally, amplification products can be detected in situ using a fluorescence scanner or recovered by reverse centrifugation for further analyses. Therefore, our chip possesses two functions: 1) it can be used for multi-target detection based on end-point in situ fluorescence detection; and 2) it can work as a sample preparation unit for analyses that need multiplex PCR such as hybridization and target sequencing. The performance of this chip was carefully examined and further illustrated in the identification of 8 pathogenic bacterial genomic DNA samples and 13 drug-resistance genes. Due to simplicity of its structure and operation, accuracy and generality, high-throughput capacity, and versatile functions (i.e., for in situ detection and sample preparation), our multiplex PCR chip has great potential in clinical diagnostics and nucleic acid-based point-of-care testing.","Xu, Yc; Yan, H; Zhang, Y; Jiang, Kw; Lu, Y; Ren, Yh; Wang, H; Wang, S; Xing, Wl",10.1039/c5lc00244c,Lab On A Chip
Interactions Of Microplastics And Soil Pollutants In Soil-Plant Systems,"In recent years, increasing studies have been reported on characterization and detection of microplastics (MPs), and their interactions with organic pollutants (OPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in soils. However, a comprehensive review on the characteristics and factors that influence MPs distribution in soils, the sorption characteristics and mechanisms of soil contaminants by MPs, especially the interactions of MPs and their complexes with pollutants in the soil-plant systems remains rarely available at present. This review focuses on the sorption features and mechanisms of pollutants by MPs in soil and discussed the effects of MPs and their complexing with pollutants on soil properties, microbe and plants. The polarity of MPs significantly influenced the sorption of OPs, and different sorption mechanisms are involved for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic OPs. The sorption of OPs on MPs in soils is different from that in water. Aging of MPs can promote the sorption and migration of contaminants. The enhanced effects of biofilm in microplastisphere on the sorption of pollutants by MPs are critical, and interactions of soil environment-MPs-microbe-HMs-antibiotics increase the potential pathogens and larger release of resistance genes. The coexistence of HMs and MPs affected the growth of plants and the uptake of HMs and MPs by the plants. Moreover, the type, dose, shape and particle size of MPs have important influences on their interactions with pollutants and subsequent effects on soil properties, microbial activities and plant growth. This review also pointed out some knowledge gaps and constructive countermeasures to promote future research in this field.","He, Sy; Wei, Yf; Yang, Cp; He, Zl",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120357,Environmental Pollution
Ecotoxicological And Health Implications Of Microplastic-Associated Biofilms: A Recent Review And Prospect For Turning The Hazards Into Benefits,"Microplastics (MPs), over the years, have been regarded as a severe environmental nuisance with adverse effects on our ecosystem as well as human health globally. In recent times, microplastics have been reported to support biofouling by genetically diverse organisms resulting in the formation of biofilms. Biofilms, however, could result in changes in the physicochemical properties of microplastics, such as their buoyancy and roughness. Many scholars perceived the microplastic-biofilm association as having more severe consequences, providing evidence of its effects on the environment, aquatic life, and nutrient cycles. Furthermore, other researchers have shown that microplastic-associated biofilms have severe consequences on human health as they serve as vectors of heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite what is already known about their adverse effects, other interesting avenues are yet to be fully explored or developed to turn the perceived negative microplastic-biofilm association to our advantage. The major inclusion criteria for relevant literature were that it must focus on microplastic association biofilms, while we excluded papers solely on biofilms or microplastics. A total of 242 scientific records were obtained. More than 90% focused on explaining the environmental and health impacts of microplastic-biofilm association, whereas only very few studies have reported the possibilities and opportunities in turning the microplastic biofilms association into benefits. In summary, this paper concisely reviews the current knowledge of microplastic-associated biofilms and their adverse consequences and further proposes some approaches that can be developed to turn the negative association into positive.","Okeke, Es; Ezeorba, Tpc; Chen, Y; Mao, Gh; Feng, Ww; Wu, Xy",10.1007/s11356-022-22612-w,Environmental Science And Pollution Research
"Advanced Oxidation Processes For The Elimination Of Microplastics From Aqueous Systems: Assessment Of Efficiency, Perspectives And Limitations","Microplastics act as a vector of heavy metals, organic pollutants, pathogens and resistance genes in the environment further aggravate the pollution of plastics. The conventional wastewater/water treatment processes can physically capture and remove most of microplastics, but the success rates varies. How to quickly remove a large amount of microplastics from aqueous system is a key research topic at present. Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as a green elimination strategy has attracted attention because of its effective elimination, strong destruction and safety. The molecular chain of microplastics can be gradually degraded into small molecular organics until H2O and CO2 by strong oxidizing free radical produced by AOPs. Unfortunately, problematically, the elimination of microplastics in aqueous system by AOPs is recently carried out on a laboratory scale. The application and implementation of this strategy are restricted by long reaction time, low liquid phase degradation efficiency and the formation of nanoplastics. Generally, the technology is still in its infancy, and most studies are carried out under laboratory conditions. The degradation of microplastics in aqueous system also needs appropriate conditions, but it is not always feasible under field conditions in AOPs. Although AOPs can be used as a green degradation technology to eliminate microplastics in aqueous systems in theory, it still needs to be furtherly explored in practical application. Consequently, before AOPs as a green elimination strategy is successfully applied to the effective remove microplastics, more in-depth research is still required, such as the setting from single condition to complex environment, the transfer from laboratory scale to field scale, and systematic toxicity evaluation of corresponding products.","Shen, Mc; Song, B; Zhou, Cy; Hu, T; Zeng, Gm; Zhang, Yx",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156723,Science Of The Total Environment
"Biofilm Formation, Virulence And Antimicrobial Resistance Of Different Campylobacter Jejuni Isolates From A Poultry Slaughterhouse","The fastidious requirement of the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni contrasts with its ability to overcome harsh conditions. Different strategies might be involved in the survival and persistence of C. jejuni through the poultry food chain. Therefore, the aims of this study were to get insights in the survival strategies in the poultry slaughterhouse environment by (i) characterizing factors such as biofilm formation, virulence and antimicrobial resistance in environmental isolates and (ii) understanding the possible link between the phenotypic and genetic characterization using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results have shown that three STs: ST 443 (PFGE A), ST 904 (PFGE C) and ST 3769 (PFGE G), out of the six studied, formed biofilms with variable intensity according to different conditions (temperatures - 37 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 25 degrees C- and materials -stainless steel and plastic-). High levels of antimicrobial resistance were found in isolates to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline as well as to two common detergents used in the slaughterhouse. A combination of several changes in the genome of ST 904 (PFGE C) including mutations, insertions in antimicrobial resistance genes, the presence of T6SS and a set of genes related to virulence factors might explain its ability to form biofilm and persist longer in the environment. However, the complexity of the survival strategies adopted by the different strains of C. jejuni suggests that multiple mechanisms may exist that allow these organisms to persist and ultimately cause disease in humans.","García-Sánchez, L; Melero, B; Jaime, I; Rossi, M; Ortega, I; Rovira, J",10.1016/j.fm.2019.05.016,Food Microbiology
Phytotoxic Effects Of Polyethylene Microplastics Combined With Cadmium On The Photosynthetic Performance Of Maize (Zea Mays L.),"Microplastics (MPs) and cadmium (Cd) has attracted increasing attention due to their combined toxicity to terrestrial vegetation. Photosynthesis which utilizes light energy to synthesize organic substances is crucial for crop production. However, the plant photosynthetic response to the joint toxicity of MPs and Cd is still unknown. Here, we studied the effects of polyethylene (PE) MPs on the photosynthetic performance of two maize cultivars Xianyu 335 (XY) and Zhengdan 958 (ZD) grown in a Cd contaminated soil. Results showed that the leaf Cd concentration in XY and ZD reached 26.1 and 31.9 mu g g-1, respectively. PE-MPs did not influence the leaf Cd content, but posed direct and negative effects on photosynthesis by increasing the malondialdehyde content, reducing the chlorophyll content, inhibiting photosynthetic capacity, disrupting the PSII donor side, blocking electron transfer in different photosystems, and suppressing the oxidation and reduction states of PSI. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect of combined PE-MPs and Cd on maize photosynthesis was attributed to suppressed expression of the genes encoding PSII, PSI, F-type ATPase, cytochrome b6/f complex, and electron transport between PSII and PSI. Using WGCNA, we identified a MEturquoise module highly correlated with photosynthetic traits. Hub genes bridging carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and translation provided the molecular mechanisms of PE-MPs and Cd tolerance in maize plants. The comprehensive information on the phytotoxicity mechanisms of Cd stress in the presence or absence of PE-MPs on the photosynthesis of maize is helpful for cloning Cd and PE-MP resistance genes in the future.","Li, Y; Feng, Hy; Xian, St; Wang, Jw; Zheng, Xb; Song, Xl",10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.108065,Plant Physiology And Biochemistry
Immunity Priming And Biostimulation By Airborne Nonanal Increase Yield Of Field-Grown Common Bean Plants,"Introduction Stress-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that induce plant immunity bear potential for biocontrol. Here, we explore the potential of nonanal to enhance the seed yield of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) under open field conditions that are realistic for smallholder farmers.Methods and results Using plastic cups with a nonanal-containing lanolin paste as low-cost dispensers, we observed that exposure of Flor de Junio Marcela (FJM) plants over 48h to airborne nonanal was followed by a 3-fold higher expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR1 and PR4. Both genes further increased their expression in response to subsequent challenge with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Therefore, we conclude that nonanal causes resistance gene priming. This effect was associated with ca. 2.5-fold lower infection rates and a 2-fold higher seed yield. Offspring of nonanal-exposed FJM plants exhibited a 10% higher emergence rate and a priming of PR1- and PR4-expression, which was associated with decreased infection by C. lindemuthianum and, ultimately, a ca. 3-fold increase in seed yield by anthracnose-infected offspring of nonanal-exposed plants. Seeds of nonanal-exposed and of challenged plants contained significantly more phenolic compounds (increase by ca 40%) and increased antioxidant and radical scavenging activity. Comparative studies including five widely used bean cultivars revealed 2-fold to 3-fold higher seed yield for nonanal-exposed plants. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis indicated a potential economic net profit of nonanal exposure for some, but not all cultivars.Outlook We consider nonanal as a promising candidate for an affordable tool that allows low-income smallholder farmers to increase the yield of an important staple-crop without using pesticides","Elizarraraz-Martínez, Ij; Rojas-Raya, Ma; Feregrino-Pérez, Aa; Partida-Martínez, Lp; Heil, M",10.3389/fpls.2024.1451864,Frontiers In Plant Science
Effect Of Human Fat Graft On Breast Cancer Metastasis In A Murine Model,"Background: Isolated adipose stem cells have been reported to encourage migration and early metastasis of breast cancer. Mimicking a surgical situation, the authors developed a human breast cancer model to evaluate in vivo whether human adipose tissue promotes tumor growth and invasion. Methods: Human adipose tissue was obtained from four patients. The MDAMB- 468 cell line was cultured with a lentiviral vector encoding a puromycin resistance gene and mCherry fluorescent protein. Virus-infected cells were selected. Animals were injected in the left renal capsule and divided into three experimental groups: group A, MDA-MB-468 cells (n = 4); group B, MDAMB- 468 cells/human adipose tissue (n = 4); and group C, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/ F-12 medium (negative control, n = 4). Metastatic development was monitored using an in vivo imaging system. Small breast epithelial mucin (SBEM), human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRTh), and murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRTm) expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect multifocal metastases in right/left renal capsule, liver, spleen, and pancreas. Results: Metastasis was observed between postinjection days 37 and 44. No significant differences were found in survival rates between groups (group A, 157 +/- 42.60 days; group B, 169 +/- 40.17 days). All samples expressed HPRTm. HPRTh and SBEM were expressed in left renal capsules from all group A and B mice, whereas in spleen, liver, pancreas, and right renal capsule the HPRTm and SBEM expression was not constant in all samples of group A and B mice. Differences were found between groups in HPRTh and SBEM expression but were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Human adipose tissue used to restore breast defects after oncologic resection did not increase metastasis development risk when there were residual breast cancer cells in proximity.","Moltó-García, R; González-Alonso, V; Villaverde-Doménech, Me; Novella-Maestre, E",10.1097/PRS.0000000000003274,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Covid-19'S Environmental Impacts: Challenges And Implications For The Future,"Strict measures have curbed the spread of COVID-19, but waste generation and movement limitations have had an unintended impact on the environment over the past 3 years (2020-2022). Many studies have summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main environmental topic (i.e., CO2 emissions) across the 3 years remains unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention than the negative ones (50.6 % versus 35.7 %), especially in emissions reduction (34 % of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 %) received the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global emission reduction, especially in terms of CO2, has received significant attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in 2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant effect on CO2 emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international aviation related CO2 emissions dropped by 59 %, 49 %, and 25 % in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped by only 3.16 % in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix, medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world.","Ang, L; Hernández-Rodríguez, E; Cyriaque, V; Yin, Xb",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165581,Science Of The Total Environment
"Under Flooding Conditions, Controlled-Release Fertiliser Coated Microplastics Affect The Growth And Accumulation Of Cadmium In Rice By Increasing The Fluidity Of Cadmium And Interfering With Metabolic Pathways","The combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and Cd can affect plant growth and development and Cd accumulation, with most studies focusing on dryland soil. However, the effects of polyurethane (PU) controlled-release fertiliser coated MPs (PU MPs), which widely exist in rice systems, coupled with Cd on plant growth and Cd accumulation under flooding conditions are still unknown. Therefore, in the present study, in situ techniques were used to systematically study the effects of PU MPs and Cd coupling on the physiological and biochemical performance, metabolomics characteristics, rhizosphere bacterial community, and Cd bioavailability of rice in different soil types (red soil/cinnamon soil). The results showed that the effects of PU MPs on rice growth and Cd accumulation were concentration-dependent, especially in red soil. High PU concentration (1 %) inhibited rice root growth significantly (44 %). The addition of PU MPs inhibited photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthesis, and transpiration rate of rice, mainly with low concentration (0.1 %) in red soil and high concentration (1 %) in cinnamon soil. PU MPs can enhance the expression of Cd resistance genes (cadC and copA) in soil, enhance the mobility of Cd, and affect the metabolic pathways of metabolites in the rhizosphere soil (red soil: fatty acid metabolism; cinnamon soil: amino acid degradation, heterobiodegradation, and nucleotide metabolism) to promote Cd absorption in rice. Especially in red soil, Cd accumulation in the root and aboveground parts of rice after the addition of high concentration PU (1 %) was 1.7 times and 1.3 times, respectively, that of the control (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, microorganisms can affect rice growth and Cd bioavailability by affecting functional bacteria related to carbon, iron, sulfur, and manganese. The results of the present study provide novel insights into the potential effects of PU MPs coupled with Cd on plants, rhizosphere bacterial communities, and Cd bioavailability","Zhao, M; Li, Cp; Zhang, C; Zhao, Yj; Wang, Xx; Cao, B; Xu, L; Zhang, Jj; Wang, Jc; Zuo, Q; Chen, Yh; Zou, Gy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166434,Science Of The Total Environment
Hidden Threats In The Plastisphere: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales Colonizing Microplastics In River Water,"Carbapenem resistance poses a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as potential contributors to antibiotic resistance spread in the environment. However, the link between MPs and carbapenem resistance remains unexplored. We investigated the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria colonizing MPs placed in a river. Three replicates of a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and of PET alone were placed both upstream and downstream a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) were further characterized by phenotypic tests and whole-genome sequencing. The abundance of carbapenem-resistant bacteria on MPs increased significantly downstream the WWTP. Their prevalence was higher in the MPs mixture compared to PET alone. CRE strains colonizing MPs included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Klebsiella quasipneumoniae (n = 3), Raoultella ornithinolytica (n = 2), Enterobacter kobei (n = 1) and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), most (n = 8) recovered after the WWTP discharge. All strains exhibited at least one of the tested virulence traits (biofilm formation at 37 degrees C, haemolytic activity and siderophore production), were multi -drug resistant and carried carbapenemase-encoding genes [blaKPC-3 (n = 5), blaGES-5 (n = 2) or blaKPC-3 + blaGES-5 (n = 3)]. Uncommon phenotypes of resistance to imipenem/relebactam (n = 3) and ceftazidime/avibactam (n = 2) were observed. Two blaKPC_ 3-positive K. pneumoniae successfully transfer this gene trough conjugation. Genome analysis predicted all strains as human pathogens. The blaKPC_ 3 was associated with the Tn4401d transposon on a pBK30683-like plasmid in most of the isolates (n = 7). The blaGES-5 was mostly linked to class 3 integrons. A K. pneumoniae strain belonging to the outbreak -causing high -risk clone ST15 carried both blaKPC-3 and blaCTX-M-15. Two K. quasipneumoniae isolates carried the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-9. Our results underscore the role of MPs as vectors for CRE dissemination, particularly following WWTPs discharges. MPs may act as carriers, facilitating the dissemination of carbapenemase-encoding genes and potentially contributing to increased CRE incidence in the environment.","Silva, I; Tacao, M; Henriques, I",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171268,Science Of The Total Environment
Biodegradation Of Polyethylene And Polystyrene By Zophobas Atratus Larvae From Bangladeshi Source And Isolation Of Two Plastic-Degrading Gut Bacteria,"Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern globally, and novel and eco-friendly approaches like bioremediation are essential to mitigate the impact. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and expanded polystyrene (EPS) are three of the most frequently used plastic types. This study examined biodegradation of these using Zophobas atratus larvae, followed by isolation and whole genome sequencing of gut bacteria collected from larvae frass. Over 36 days, 24.04 % LDPE, 20.01 % EPS, and 15.12 % LLDPE were consumed on average by the larvae, with survival rates of 85 %, 90 %, and 87 %, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of fresh plastic types, consumed plastics, and larvae frass showed proof of plastic oxidation in the gut. Frass bacteria were isolated and cultured in minimal salt media supplemented with plastics as the sole carbon source. Two isolates of bacteria were sampled from these cultures, designated PDB-1 and PDB-2. PDB-1 could survive on LDPE and LLDPE as carbon sources, whereas PDB-2 could survive on EPS. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) provided proof of degradation in both cases. Both isolates were identified as strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by sequencing, assembly, and annotation of their genomes. LDPE- and LLDPE-degrading enzymes e.g., P450 monooxygenase, alkane monooxygenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, etc. were identified in PDB-1. Similarly, phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes involved in EPS degradation were identified in PDB-2. Genes of both isolates were compared with genomes of known plastic-degrading P. aeruginosa strains. Virulence factors, antibiotic-resistance genes, and rhamnolipid biosurfactant biosynthesis genes were also identified in both isolates. This study indicated Zophobas atratus larvae as potential LDPE, LLDPE, and EPS biodegradation agent. Additionally, the isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provide a more direct and eco-friendly solution for plastic degradation. Confirmation and modification of the plastic-degrading pathways in the bacteria may create scope for metabolic engineering in the future.","Zaman, I; Turjya, Rr; Shakil, Ms; Al Shahariar, M; Emu, Mrrh; Ahmed, A; Hossain, Mm",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123446,Environmental Pollution
High-Level Recombinant Protein Production By The Basidiomycetous Yeast Pseudozyma Antarctica Under A Xylose-Inducible Xylanase Promoter,"Yeast host-vector systems are useful tools for the production of recombinant proteins. Here, we report the construction of a new high-level expression plasmid pPAX1-neo for the basidiomycetous yeast, Pseudozyma antarctica. pPAX1-neo harbours a xylose-inducible expression cassette under control of the xylanase promoter and terminator of P. antarctica T-34, a selection cassette of neomycin/G418 with an Escherichia coli neomycin resistance gene under control of the homocitrate synthase promoter of strain T-34, and an autonomously replicating sequence fragment of Ustilago maydis (UARS). Biodegradable plastic (BP)-degrading enzymes of P. antarctica JCM10317 (PaE) and Paraphoma-related fungal strain B47-9 (PCLE) were used as reporter proteins and inserted into pPAX1-neo, resulting in pPAX1-neo::PaCLE1 and pPAX1-neo::PCLE, respectively. Homologous and heterologous BP-degrading enzyme production of transformants of P. antarctica T-34 were detected on agar plates containing xylose and emulsified BP. Recombinant PaE were also produced by transformants of other Pseudozyma strains including Pseudozyma aphidis, Pseudozyma rugulosa, and Pseudozyma tsukubaensis. To improve the stability of transformed genes in cells, the UARS fragment was removed from linearized pPAX1-neo::PaCLE1 and integrated into the chromosome of the P. antarctica strain, GB-4(0), which was selected as a PaE producer in xylose media. Two transformants, GB-4(0)-X14 and X49, had an 11-fold higher activity compared with the wild type strain in xylose-containing liquid media. By xylose fed-batch cultivation using a 3-L jar fermentor, GB-4(0)-X14 produced 73.5 U mL(-1) of PaE, which is 13.4-fold higher than that of the wild type strain GB-4(0), which produced 5.5 U mL(-1) of PaE.","Watanabe, T; Morita, T; Koike, H; Yarimizu, T; Shinozaki, Y; Sameshima-Yamashita, Y; Yoshida, S; Koitabashi, M; Kitamoto, H",10.1007/s00253-015-7232-7,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
Cytological Observation And Transcriptome Analysis Reveal Dynamic Changes Of Rhizoctonia Solani Colonization On Leaf Sheath And Different Genes Recruited Between The Resistant And Susceptible Genotypes In Rice,"Sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is a big threat to the global rice production. To characterize the early development of R. solani on rice leaf and leaf sheath, two genotypes, GD66 (a resistant genotype) and Lemont (a susceptible genotype), were observed using four cytological techniques: the whole-mount eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy (WE-CLSM), stereoscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and plastic semi-thin sectioning after in vitro inoculation. WE-CLSM observation showed that, at 12 h post-inoculation (hpi), the amount of hyphae increased dramatically on leaf and sheath surface, the infection cushions occurred and maintained at a huge number from about 18 to 36 hpi, and then the infection cushions disappeared gradually from about 42 to 72 hpi. Interestingly, R. solani could not only colonize on the abaxial surfaces of leaf sheath but also invade the paraxial side of the leaf sheath, which shows a different behavior from that of leaf. RNA sequencing detected 6,234 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for Lemont and 7,784 DEGs for GD66 at 24 hpi, and 2,523 DEGs for Lemont and 2,719 DEGs for GD66 at 48 hpi, suggesting that GD66 is recruiting more genes in fighting against the pathogen. Among DEGs, resistant genes, such as OsRLCK5, Xa21, and Pid2, displayed higher expression in the resistant genotype than the susceptible genotype at both 24 and 48 hpi, which were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Our results indicated that the resistance phenotype of GD66 was the consequence of recruiting a series of resistance genes involved in different regulatory pathways. WE-CLSM is a powerful technique for uncovering the mechanism of R. solani invading rice and for detecting rice sheath blight-resistant germplasm.","Liu, Sl; Wang, Ty; Meng, Gx; Liu, Jh; Lu, Db; Liu, Xd; Zeng, Yx",10.3389/fpls.2022.1055277,Frontiers In Plant Science
Continuous Generation And Release Of Microplastics And Nanoplastics From Polystyrene By Plastic-Degrading Marine Bacteria,"Plastic waste released into the environments breaks down into microplastics due to weathering, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mechanical abrasion, and animal grazing. However, little is known about the plastic fragmentation mediated by microbial degradation. Marine plastic-degrading bacteria may have a double-edged effect in removing plastics. In this study, two ubiquitous marine bacteria, Alcanivorax xenomutans and Halomonas titanicae, were confirmed to degrade polystyrene (PS) and lead to microplastic and nanoplastic generation. Biodegradation occurred during bacterial growth with PS as the sole energy source, and the formation of carboxyl and carboxylic acid groups, decreased heat resistance, generation of PS metabolic intermediates in cultures, and plastic weight loss were observed. The generation of microplastics was dynamic alongside PS biodegradation. The size of the released microplastics gradually changed from microsized plastics on the first day (1344 nm and 1480 nm, respectively) to nanoplastics on the 30th day (614 nm and 496 nm, respectively) by the two tested strains. The peak release from PS films reached 6.29 x 106 particles/L and 7.64 x 106 particles/L from degra-dation by A. xenomutans (Day 10) and H. titanicae (Day 5), respectively. Quantification revealed that 1.3% and 1.9% of PS was retained in the form of micro-and nanoplastics, while 4.5% and 1.9% were mineralized by A. xenomutans and H. titanicae at the end of incubation, respectively. This highlights the negative effects of microbial degradation, which results in the continuous release of numerous microplastics, especially nano -plastics, as a notable secondary pollution into marine ecosystems. Their fates in the vast aquatic system and their impact on marine lives are noted for further study.","Lv, Sw; Cui, Kx; Zhao, Sf; Li, Yf; Liu, Rj; Hu, Rx; Zhi, B; Gu, L; Wang, L; Wang, Qf; Shao, Zz",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133339,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics Accumulate Priority Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens: Evidence From The Riverine Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) might accumulate and transport antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in aquatic systems. We determined the abundance and diversity of culturable ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria in biofilms covering MPs placed in river water, and characterized priority pathogens from these biofilms. Our results showed that the abundance of ARB colonizing MPs tends to be higher compared to sand particles. Also, higher numbers were cultivated from a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), compared to PP and PET alone. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas isolates were the most frequently retrieved from MPs placed before a WWTP discharge while Enterobacteriaceae dominated the culturable plastisphere 200 m after the WWTP discharge. Ciprofloxacin- and/or cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 54 unique isolates) were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 9), Enterobacter spp. (n = 4) and Shigella sp. (n = 1). All isolates presented at least one of the virulence features tested (i.e. biofilm formation, haemolytic activity and production of siderophores), 70% carried the intI1 gene and 85% exhibited a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in ciprofloxacinresistant Enterobacteriaceae [aacA4-cr (40% of the isolates), qnrS (30%), qnrB (25%), and qnrVC (8%)], along with mutations in gyrA (70%) and parC (72%). Cefotaxime-resistant strains (n = 23) harbored blaCTX-M (70%), blaTEM (61%) and blaSHV (39%). Among CTX-M producers, high-risk clones of E. coli (e.g. ST10 or ST131) and K. pneumoniae (ST17) were identified, most of which carrying blaCTX-M-15. Ten out of 16 CTX-M producers were able to transfer blaCTX-M to a recipient strain. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the riverine plastisphere, harboring ARGs of clinical concern and exhibiting virulence traits, suggesting a contribution of MPs to the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens. The type of MPs and especially water contamination (e.g. by WWTPs discharges) seem to determine the resistome of the riverine plastisphere.","Silva, I; Rodrigues, Et; Taca, M; Henriques, I",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121995,Environmental Pollution
Press Perturbations Of Microplastics And Antibiotics On Freshwater Micro-Ecosystem: Case Study For The Ecological Restoration Of Submerged Plants,"Microplastics (MPs) can adsorb antibiotics to form complex pollutants, which seriously threatens the health of freshwater ecosystems. Few studies have examined the combined pollution characteristics of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics in restored freshwater ecosystems and their effects on the growth traits of the aquatic primary producers. We studied both the ecotoxicological effects of polyethylene (PE) MPs and the antibiotics sulfanil-amide (sulfa, SA) on the structural (diversity etc.,) and functional (nutrient cycling etc.,) properties of water--plant-sediment ecosystems. The synergistic toxic effects of PE and SA resulted in a reduction in the chlorophyll content and chloroplast fluorescence. Meanwhile, PE and SA single/combined pollution stress inhibits the radial oxygen loss in roots, and activates the antioxidant defense system in leaves. The change in the growth response characteristics of Vallisneria natans (V. natans) under oxidative stress induced by single/combined pollution showed a dosage effect. The microbial compositions of the overlying water and sediment were significantly changed by the pollution exposure, as evidenced by the increased microbial diversity and altered microbial taxa distribution. An increase in the total concentrations of sulfa in the overlying water was accompanied by an in-crease in the relative abundances of resistance genes. PE-MPs significantly affected the removal of total nitrogen and antibiotics from the overlying water. The interaction between PE and SA affects ammonia and nitrite ni-trogen exchange in water-sediment systems. Thus, this study investigated the effects of combined MP and an-tibiotics pollution on the growth state, metabolic function, microbial community structure and microbial diversity of the freshwater ecosystems. The mechanism underlying of the combined polyethylene-sulfanilamide (PE-SA) effect on the V. natans was revealed. In addition, the correlation between different environmental factors was analyzed, and a structural equation model was constructed. This study provides primary data for evaluating the ecological and environmental effects of combined PE-SA pollution and its possible risks. Moreover, it pro-vides a reference index for the study of ecological wetland environments and phytoremediation.","Zhang, Sy; Wang, H; Liu, Mm; Yu, Hw; Peng, Jf; Cao, Xf; Wang, Cr; Liu, Rp; Kamali, M; Qu, Jh",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119248,Water Research
Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Promote Bacterial Conjugative Plasmid Transfer,"Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) regularly enter aquatic environments due to their ubiquity in consumer products and engineering applications. However, the effects of MWCNT pollution on the environmental microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether these carbon nanopartides can elevate the spread of antimicrobial resistance by promoting bacterial plasmid transfer, which has previously been observed for copper nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties as well as for microplastics. Through a combination of experimental liquid mating assays between Pseudomonas putida donor and recipient strains with plasmid plOKS:gfpmut3b and mathematical modeling, we here demonstrate that the presence of MWCNTs leads to increased plasmid transfer rates in a concentration-dependent manner. The percentage of transconjugants per recipient significantly increased from 0.21 +/- 0.04% in absence to 0.41 +/- 0.09% at 10 mg L-1 MWCNTs. Similar trends were observed when using an Eschenthia coil donor hosting plasmid pB10. The identified mechanism underlying the observed dynamics was the agglomeration of MWCNTs. A significantly increased number of particles with >6 mu m diameter was detected in the presence of MWCNTs, which can in turn provide novel surfaces for bacterial interactions between donor and recipient cells after colonization. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that MWCNT agglomerates were indeed covered in biofilms that contained donor bacteria as well as elevated numbers of green fluorescent transconjugant cells containing the plasmid. Consequently, MWCNTs provide bacteria with novel surfaces for intense cell-to-cell interactions in biofilms and can promote bacterial plasmid transfer, hence potentially elevating the spread of antimicrobial resistance. IMPORTANCE In recent decades, the use of carbon nanoparticles, especially multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), in a variety of products and engineering applications has been growing exponentially. As a result, MWCNT pollution into environmental compartments has been increasing. We here demonstrate that the exposure to MWCNTs can affect bacterial plasmid transfer rates in aquatic environments, an important process connected to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in microbial communities. This is mechanistically explained by the ability of MWCNTs to form bigger agglomerates, hence providing novel surfaces for bacterial interactions. Consequently, increasing pollution with MWCNTs has the potential to elevate the ongoing spread of antimicrobial resistance, a major threat to human health in the 21st century.","Weise, K; Winter, L; Fischer, E; Kneis, D; Barron, Md; Kunze, S; Berendonk, Tu; Jungmann, D; Klümper, U",10.1128/spectrum.00410-22,Microbiology Spectrum
Which Micropollutants In Water Environments Deserve More Attention Globally?,"Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as micropollutants due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer.","Yang, Y; Zhang, Xr; Jiang, Jy; Han, Jr; Li, Wx; Li, Xy; Leung, Kmy; Snyder, Sa; Alvarez, Pjj",10.1021/acs.est.1c04250,Environmental Science & Technology
Differential Genetic Responses To The Stress Revealed The Mutation-Order Adaptive Divergence Between Two Sympatric Ginger Species,"Background: Divergent genetic responses to the same environmental pressures may lead sympatric ecological speciation possible. Such speciation process possibly explains rapid sympatric speciation of island species. Two island endemic ginger species Zingiber kawagoii and Z. shuanglongensis was suggested to be independently originated from inland ancestors, but their island endemism and similar morphologies and habitats lead another hypothesis of in situ ecological speciation. For understanding when and how these two species diverged, intraspecific variation was estimated from three chloroplast DNA fragments (cpDNA) and interspecific genome-wide SNPs and expression differences after saline treatment were examined by transcriptomic analyses. Results: Extremely low intraspecific genetic variation was estimated by cpDNA sequences in both species: nucleotide diversity pi = 0.00002 in Z. kawagoii and no nucleotide substitution but only indels found in Z. shuanglongensis. Nonsignificant inter-population genetic differentiation suggests homogenized genetic variation within species. Based on 53,683 SNPs from 13,842 polymorphic transcripts, in which 10,693 SNPs are fixed between species, Z. kawagoii and Z. shuanglongensis were estimated to be diverged since 218 similar to 238 thousand generations ago (complete divergence since 41.5 similar to 43.5 thousand generations ago). This time is more recent than the time of Taiwan Island formation. In addition, high proportion of differential expression genes (DEGs) is non-polymorphic or non-positively selected, suggesting key roles of plastic genetic divergence in broaden the selectability in incipient speciation. While some positive selected DEGs were mainly the biotic and abiotic stress-resistance genes, emphasizing the importance of adaptive divergence of stress-related genes in sympatric ecological speciation. Furthermore, the higher proportional expression of functional classes in Z. kawagoii than in Z. shuanglongensis explains the more widespread distribution of Z. kawagoii in Taiwan. Conclusions: Our results contradict the previous hypothesis of independent origination of these two island endemic ginger species from SE China and SW China. Adaptive divergent responses to the stress explain how these gingers maintain genetic differentiation in sympatry. However, the recent speciation and rapid expansion make extremely low intraspecific genetic variation in these two species. This study arise a more probable speciation hypothesis of sympatric speciation within an island via the mutation-order mechanism underlying the same environmental pressure.","Huang, Bh; Lin, Yc; Huang, Cw; Lu, Hp; Luo, Mx; Liao, Pc",10.1186/s12864-018-5081-3,Bmc Genomics
Size-Dependent Enhancement On Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes By Micro/Nanoplastics,"Recently micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) have raised intensive concerns due to their possible enhancement effect on the dissemination of antibiotic genes. Unfortunately, data is still lacking to verify the effect. In the study, the influence of polystyrene MNPs on the conjugative gene transfer was studied by using E. coli DH5alpha with RP4 plasmid as the donor bacteria and E. coli K12 MG1655 as the recipient bacteria. We found that influence of MNPs on gene transfer was size-dependent. Small MNPs (10 nm in radius) caused an increase and then a decrease in gene transfer efficiency with their concentration increasing. Moderate-sized MNPs (50 nm in radius) caused an increase in gene transfer efficiency. Large MNPs (500 nm in radius) had almost no influence on gene transfer. The gene transfer could be further enhanced by optimizing mating time and mating ratio. Scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) production did not affect the cell membrane permeability, indicating that the increase in cell membrane permeability was not related to ROS production. The mechanism of the enhanced gene transfer efficiency was attributed to a combined effect of the increased ROS production and the increased cell membrane permeability, which ultimately regulated the expression of corresponding genes.","Zha, Yy; Li, Zw; Zhong, Z; Ruan, Ym; Sun, Ll; Zuo, Ff; Li, Lz; Hou, S",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128561,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Rapid Detection Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Lactic Acid Bacteria Using Pmma-Based Microreactor Arrays,"The emergence of lactic acid bacteria (LABs) resistant to existing antimicrobial drugs is a growing health crisis. To decrease the overuse of antibiotics, molecular diagnostic systems that can rapidly determine the presence of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in LABs from yogurt samples are needed. This paper describes a fully integrated, miniaturized plastic chip and closed-tube detection chemistry that performs multiplex nucleic acid amplification. High-throughput identification of AR genes was achieved through this approach, and six AR genes were analyzed simultaneously in < 2 h. This time-to-result included the time required for the extraction of DNA. The detection limit of the chip was 10(3) CFU mL(-1), which was consistent with that of tube LAMP. We detected and identified multiple DNAs, including streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin resistance-associated genes, with complete concordance to the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.","Jin, Zj; Ding, Gt; Yan, Gx; Li, Gy; Zhang, W; Yang, Lx; Li, Wh",10.1007/s00253-020-10699-5,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
Co-Occurrence Of Microplastics And Triclosan Inhibited Nitrification Function And Enriched Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Nitrifying Sludge,"As more and more microplastics (MPs) and triclosan (TCS), which are added in consumer products, enter wastewater treatment plants with sewage, there are concerns about the impacts of the co-occurrence of MPs and TCS on biological wastewater treatment. In this study, the co-effects of four 1 mg/L MPs (polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (PA)) and 0.5 mg/L TCS on nitrification were investigated in lab-scale nitrifying sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) (SBR-PE, SBR-PS, SBR-PVC and SBR-PA) relative to control which received no MPs (SBR-CK). The removal rates of NH4+-N and TCS in SBR-CK were around 100% and 92%, respectively. Compared with SBR-CK, no measurable inhibition was observed on nitrification in SBR-PE and SBR-PS, however, SBR-PVC and SBR-PA rapidly lost nitrification function during 14 days, which might be due to the reducing of MLSS caused by PVC, PA and TCS co-loading. Furthermore, PS, PVC and PA decreased the removal of TCS. The co-occurrence of TCS and PS, PVC, PA increased extracellular polymeric substances, reduced microbial diversity and shifted microbial communities. Notably, the acrA-03, mexF, fabI, intI1, intI3 and IS613 genes were enriched by MPs and TCS co-loading. Therefore, the removal of MPs and TCS from wastewater should be prioritized.","Wang, Zq; Gao, Jf; Li, Dc; Dai, Hh; Zhao, Yf",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123049,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics Pollution In The Ocean: Potential Carrier Of Resistant Bacteria And Resistance Genes,"Microplastics pollution in marine environments is concerning. Microplastics persist and accumulate in various sections of the ocean where they present opportunity for micropollutant accumulation and microbial colonisation. Even though biofilm formation on plastics was first reported in the 1970's, it is only in recent years were plastic associated biofilms have gained research attention. Plastic surfaces pose a problem as they are a niche ready for colonisation by diverse biofilm assemblages, composed of specific bacterial communities and putative pathogens prone to acquiring ARGs and resistance in the biofilm. However, the nature of antibiotic resistance on aquatic plastic debris is not yet fully understood and remains a concern. Given the inevitable increase of plastic production and waste generation, microplastics released into the environment may prove to be problematic. This review explores microplastic waste in the ocean and possible concerns that may arise from the presence of microplastics in conjunction with favourable conditions for the development and dispersal of antibiotic resistance in the ocean and food web.","Stenger, Ks; Wikmark, Og; Bezuidenhout, Cc; Molale-Tom, Lg",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118130,Environmental Pollution
Effects Of Microplastics On Dissipation Of Oxytetracycline And Its Relevant Resistance Genes In Soil Without And With Serratia Marcescens: Comparison Between Biodegradable And Conventional Microplastics,"The biodegradable (polybutylene adipate terephthalate: PBAT) and conventional (polyethylene: PE) microplastics (MPs) at 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % dosages (w/w) were added into soils with and without Serratia marcescens ZY01 (ZY01, a tet-host strain) to understand their different effects on the dissipation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and tet. The results showed that the dosages of PBAT MP exhibited different inhibition degrees of OTC biodegradation in soils regardless of ZY01, while the dosages of PE MP did not change the enhancement degree of OTC biodegradation in soils without ZY01. These differences were due to the higher adsorption capacity of OTC on PBAT MP and the stronger toxicity of PBAT MP to microorganisms. Besides soil organic matter, pH and total phosphorus were important factors regulating specific tet-host bacteria in soils with MPs (e.g., the nitrogencycling bacteria Steroidobacter and Nitrospira) and MPs + ZY01 (e.g., the phosphorus-cycling bacteria Saccharimonadales and Haliangium), respectively. Regardless of ZY01, a stronger selective harboring of tet-host bacteria in PE MP treatments than PBAT MP treatments was observed at the MP dosage of 1 % (w/w), while the opposite trend was true at the MP dosages of 0.5 % and 2 % (w/w). Some specific genera belonging to Actinobacteriota strongly associated with the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), playing a critical role in the horizontal gene transfer of tet in soils especially for the co-existence of MPs and ZY01. This study will be helpful for understanding on how biodegradable and conventional MPs as hotspots affect the environmental behavior of antibiotics and ARGs in soil.","Zhang, Gx; Ren, R; Yan, Xr; Zhang, Hy; Zhu, Y",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117235,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Shallow Shotgun Sequencing Of Healthcare Waste Reveals Plastic-Eating Bacteria With Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"The burgeoning crises of antimicrobial resistance and plastic pollution are converging in healthcare settings, presenting a complex challenge to global health. This study investigates the microbial populations in healthcare waste to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance and the potential for plastic degradation by bacteria. Our metagenomic analysis, using both amplicon and shallow shotgun sequencing, provided a comprehensive view of the taxonomic diversity and functional capacity of the microbial consortia. The viable bacteria in healthcare waste samples were analyzed employing full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, revealing a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Notably, Proteus mirabilis VFC3/3 and Pseudomonas sp. VFA2/3 were detected, while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VFV3/2 surfaced as the predominant species, holding implications for the spread of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multidrug-resistant strains conferring antimicrobial genes, including the broad-spectrum antibiotic carbapenem, underscoring the critical need for improved waste management and infection control measures. Remarkably, we found genes linked to the breakdown of plastic that encoded for enzymes of the esterase, depolymerase, and oxidoreductase classes. This suggests that specific bacteria found in medical waste may be able to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that comes from biological and medical waste. The information is helpful in formulating strategies to counter the combined problems of environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring microbial communities in hospital waste in order to influence waste management procedures and public health policy. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance and plastic waste, especially in hospital settings where they intersect most acutely.","Siew, Sw; Khairi, Mhf; Hamid, Na; Asras, Mff; Ahmad, Hf",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125330,Environmental Pollution
Performance Of Sewage Sludge Treatment For The Removal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Status And Prospects,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) receive wastewater containing antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), which are predominant contributors to environmental pollution in water and soil. Of these sources, sludge is a more significant contributor than effluent. Knowing how sludge treatment affects the fate of ARGs is vital for managing the risk of these genes in both human and natural environments. This review therefore discusses the sources and transmission of ARGs in the environment and highlights the risks of ARGs in sludge. The effects of co-existing constituents (heavy metals, microplastics, etc.) on sludge and ARGs during treatment are collated to highlight the difficulty of treating sludge with complex constituents in ARGs. The effects of various sludge treatment methods on the abundances of ARGs in sludge and in soil from land application of treated sludge are discussed, pointing out that the choice of sludge treatment method should take into account various potential factors, such as soil and soil biology in subsequent land application. This review offers significant insights and explores the abundances of ARGs throughout the process of sludge treatment and disposal. Unintentional addition of antibiotic residues, heavy metals, microplastics and organic matter in sludge could significantly increase the abundance and reduce the removal efficiency of ARGs during treatment, which undoubtedly adds a barrier to the removal of ARGs from sludge treatment. The complexity of the sludge composition and the diversities of ARGs have led to the fact that no effective sludge treatment method has so far been able to completely eliminate the ecological risk of ARGs. In order to reduce risks resulting by transmission of ARGs, technical and management measures need to be implemented.","Yin, Sy; Gao, L; Fan, Xm; Gao, Sh; Zhou, X; Jin, Wb; He, Zq; Wang, Ql",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167862,Science Of The Total Environment
Impact Of The Surrounding Environment On Antibiotic Resistance Genes Carried By Microplastics In Mangroves,"located at the intersection of land and sea and are seriously affected by MP pollution. However, few studies have systematic research evaluating the transmission risk of ARGs carried by MPs in mangroves. We conducted in situ experiments by burying five different MPs (polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, polystyrene, polyethylene glycol terephthalate, and polycaprolactone particles) in mangroves with different surrounding environments. A total of 10 genes in the MPs of mangroves were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, including eight ARGs and two mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The abundance of ARGs in Guanhai park mangroves in living areas (GH) was higher than that of Gaoqiao mangroves in protected areas (GQ) and Beiyue dike mangroves in aquaculture pond areas (BY). Pathogenic bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Vibrio were found on the MP surfaces of the mangroves. The number of ARGs carried by multiple drug-resistant bacteria in the GH mangroves was greater than that in the GQ and BY mangroves. Moreover, the ARGs carried by MPs in GH mangroves had the highest potential transmission risk by horizontal gene transfer. Sociometric and environmental factors were the main drivers shaping the distribution characteristics of ARGs and MGEs. Polypropylene and high-density polyethylene particles are preferred substrates for obtaining diffuse ARGs. This study investigated the drivers of ARGs in the MPs of mangroves and provided essential guidance on the use and handling of plastics.","Sun, Rk; He, L; Li, T; Dai, Zq; Sun, Sl; Ren, L; Liang, Yq; Zhang, Yq; Li, Cy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155771,Science Of The Total Environment
Cucumis Metuliferus Reduces Meloidogyne Incognita Virulence Against The Mi1.2 Resistance Gene In A Tomato-Melon Rotation Sequence,"BACKGROUND Susceptible tomato cv. Durinta, ungrafted or grafted onto cv. Aligator resistant rootstock, both followed by the susceptible melon cv. Paloma, ungrafted or grafted onto Cucumis metuliferus BGV11135, and in the reverse order, were cultivated from 2015 to 2017 in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse, infested or not with Meloidogyne incognita. For each crop, soil nematode densities, galling index, number of eggs per plant and crop yield were determined. Virulence selection was evaluated in pot experiments. RESULTS In the tomato-melon rotation, nematode densities increased progressively for the grafted tomato, being higher than for ungrafted plants at the end of the study; this was not the case in the melon-tomato rotation. Grafted crops yielded more than ungrafted crops in the infested plots. Virulence against the Mi1.2 gene was detected, but not against C. metuliferus. Reproduction of M. incognita on the resistant tomato was similar to 120% that on the susceptible cultivar after the first grafted tomato crop, but this decreased to just 25% at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION Alternating different resistant plant species suppresses nematode population growth rate and yield losses. Although this strategy does not prevent virulence selection, the level was reduced.

Knowledge Gaps In The Assessment Of Antimicrobial Resistance In Surface Waters,"The spread of antibiotic resistance in the water environment has been widely described. However, still many knowledge gaps exist regarding the selection pressure from antibiotics, heavy metals and other substances present in surface waters as a result of anthropogenic activities, as well as the extent and impact of this phenomenon on aquatic organisms and humans. In particular, the relationship between environmental concentrations of antibiotics and the acquisition of ARGs by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria as well as the impact of heavy metals and other selective agents on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) need to be defined. Currently, established safety values are based on the effects of antibiotic toxicity neglecting the question of AMR spread. In turn, risk assessment of antibiotics in waterbodies remains a complex question implicating multiple variables and unknowns reinforced by the lack of harmonized protocols and official guidelines. In the present review, we discussed current state-of-the-art and the knowledge gaps related to pressure exerted by antibiotics and heavy metals on aquatic environments and their relationship to the spread of AMR. Along with this latter, we reflected on (i) the risk assessment in surface waters, (ii) selective pressures contributing to its transfer and propagation and (iii) the advantages of metagenomics in investigating AMR. Furthermore, the role of microplastics in co-selection for metal and antibiotic resistance, together with the need for more studies in freshwater are highlighted.","Niegowska, M; Sanseverino, I; Navarro, A; Lettieri, T",10.1093/femsec/fiab140,Fems Microbiology Ecology
Uv-Aging Reduces The Effects Of Biodegradable Microplastics On Soil Sulfamethoxazole Degradation And Sul Genes Development,"In recent years, the biodegradable plastics has extensively used in industry, agriculture, and daily life. Herein, the effects of two biodegradable microplastics (BMPs), poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), on soil sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation and sul genes development were comparatively studied based on the type, dosage, and state. The addition of virgin BMPs significantly increased soil DOC following a sequential order PBAT > PHA and high dose > low dose. Meanwhile virgin PBAT significantly reduced soil pH. In general, the addition of BMPs not only promoted soil SMX degradation but also increased the abundance of sul genes, with an exception that pH reduction in virgin PBAT inhibited the proliferation of sul genes. The driving effects of BMPs on soil microbial diversity following the same order as that on DOC. Specific bacteria stimulated by BMPs, such as Arthrobacter and two genera affiliated with phylum TM7, accounted for the accelerated degradation of SMX. Intriguingly, UV -aging hindered the release of DOC from BMPs and the reduction in pH, mitigated the stimulation of microbial communities, and ultimately reduced the promotion effect of BMPs on SMX degradation and sul genes proliferation. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to the proliferation risk of ARGs in the environment affected by BMPs and UV -aging can be employed sometimes to reduce this risk.

Bpa And Its Analogues (Bps And Bpf) Modify The Expression Of Genes Involved In The Endocrine Pathway And Apoptosis And A Multi Drug Resistance Gene Of The Aquatic Midge Chironomus Riparius (Diptera),"Many countries are limiting the use of bisphenol A (BPA) because evidence shows it is dangerous to human health and wildlife. For the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are proposed as safer alternatives. They have already been released into the aquatic environment without previously available information about their potential adverse effects. In this study, we compared the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF exposure to the expression profile of genes involved in the endocrine pathway (EcR and E74), ecdysone metabolism (Cyp18a1 and Shadow), apoptosis (DRONC) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 gene (MRP1) in the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera). The three toxicants increased Shadow expression, which is involved in ecdysone synthesis, but only BPF significantly altered Cyp18a1, which is implicated in ecdysone degradation. BPS and BPF modified EcR and E74 expression; BPF upregulated the effector caspase DRONC. Furthermore, BPA significantly increased MRP1 expression. This study provides insights into the action of bisphenols at the molecular level and highlights the potential risks of BPS and BPF as BPA alternatives. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Microplastic Biodegradability Dependent Responses Of Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistance To Simulated Freshwater-Seawater Shift In Onshore Marine Aquaculture Zones,"MPs carrying ARGs can travel between freshwater and seawater due to intensive land-sea interaction in onshore marine aquaculture zones (OMAZ). However, the response of ARGs in plastisphere with different biodegrad-ability to freshwater-seawater shift is still unknown. In this study, ARG dynamics and associated microbiota on biodegradable poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and non-biodegradable polyethylene tere-phthalate (PET) MPs were investigated through a simulated freshwater-seawater shift. The results exhibited that freshwater-seawater shift significantly influenced ARG abundance in plastisphere. The relative abundance of most studied ARGs decreased rapidly in plastisphere after they entered seawater from freshwater but increased on PBAT after MPs entered freshwater from seawater. Besides, the high relative abundance of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes occurred in plastisphere, and the co-change between most ARGs and mobile genetic elements indicated the role of horizontal gene transfer on ARG regulation. Proteobacteria was dominant phylum in plastisphere and the dominant genera, such as Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Afipia, Gemmobacter and Enhydrobacter, were significantly associated with qnrS, tet and MDR genes in plastisphere. Moreover, after MPs entered new water environment, the ARGs and microbiota genera in plastisphere changed significantly and tended to converge with those in receiving water. These results indicated that MP biodegrad-ability and freshwater-seawater interaction influenced potential hosts and distributions of ARGs, of which biodegradable PBAT posed a high risk in ARG dissemination. This study would be helpful for understanding the impact of biodegradable MP pollution on spread of antibiotic resistance in OMAZ.","Zhou, Q; Zhang, J; Fang, Qk; Zhang, M; Wang, Xa; Zhang, Dy; Pan, Xl",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121828,Environmental Pollution
Changes In Tetracycline Partitioning And Bacteria/Phage-Comediated Args In Microplastic-Contaminated Greenhouse Soil Facilitated By Sophorolipid,"The emerging mixed contamination of antibiotics and microplastics in greenhouse soil has made the control of antibiotic resistant gene (ARG) transmission a novel challenge. In this work, surfactant sophorolipid was applied to enhance the dissipation of tetracycline (TC) and tet genes in the presence of microplastics in greenhouse soil. During 49 days of incubation, soil bacteria and phages were both found to be the crucial reservoirs of ARGs. Meanwhile, microplastic's presence significantly inhibited the dissipation of TC and ARGs in the soil. However, sophorolipid application was proved to outweigh the negative impact caused by microplastic existence, and lead to the highest dissipation of soil TC and ARGs. Significant positive correlation was detected between the dissipation rate of watersoluble and exchangeable TC content and bacteria/phage co-mediated ARG levels. This also held true between the-two fractions of soil TC and the ratio of ARG level in the bacteria to that in the phages (BARcs/PARcs). The opposite impacts of microplastic presence and sophorolipid amendment on the TC/ARG dissipation found in this work provides new information for understanding ARG transmission between bacteria and phages in the mixed contaminated greenhouse soil.

Growth And Prevalence Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Microplastic Biofilm From Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluents,"It is accepted that Microplastic (MP) biofilms accumulates antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in water. ARB/ARGs and MPs are emerging pollutants of concern due to various associated health risks. The objective of this study was to 1) investigate the ARB community in a pilot-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, 2) to study and visualize the ARB/ARGs in MP biofilm grown in WWTP effluent and tap water, and 3) to analyze microplastic adherent ARB/ARGs in the biofilm and planktonic ARB/ARGs in the filtrate under controlled conditions. Results indicated the dominance of Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Bacillus among isolated ARB in WWTP effluent. Representative resistance strains were incubated in 300 mL water containing commercial poly-styrene beads of 300550 mu m diameter (MP) in a series of batch experiments. Microbiological, molecular, and micro-scopic analyses were performed by enumeration, 16srRNA, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM) techniques. The analyzed viable ARB indicated an increasing trend in MP biofilms between days 3 and 5. It further decreased on days 7 and 9. The prevalence of ARB in the filtrate and MP biofilm varied as a function of time and TOC level, while no significant impacts were observed for minor temperature variation, low antibiotic pressure, and increased MP mass with few exceptions. Relative abundance of ARGs (vanA, sul1) and integron integrase gene (intl1) in MP biofilm were significantly different across different TOC levels, time, and antibiotic pressure.

Microplastic-Associated Pathogens And Antimicrobial Resistance In Environment,"The ubiquitous use of microplastics and their release into the environment especially the water bodies by anthropogenic/industrial activities are the major resources for microplastic contamination. The widespread and often injudicious use of antimicrobial drugs or antibiotics in various sectors including human health and hygiene, agriculture, animal husbandry and food industries are leading to the release of antibiotics into the wastewater/ sewage and other water bodies, particularly in urban setups and thus leads to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the microbes. Microplastics are emerging as the hubs as well as effective carriers of these microbial pathogens beside their AMR-genes (ARGs) in marine, freshwater, sewage/wastewater, and urban river ecosystems. These drug resistant bacteria interact with microplastics forming synthetic plastispheres, the ideal niche for biofilm formations which in turn facilitates the transfer of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer and further escalates the occurrence and levels of AMR. Microplastic-associated AMR is an emerging threat for human health and healthcare besides being a challenge for the research community for effective management/address of this menace. In this review, we encompass the increasing prevalence of microplastics in environment, emphasizing mainly on water environments, how they act as centers and vectors of microbial pathogens with their associated bacterial assemblage compositions and ultimately lead to AMR. It further discusses the mechanistic insights on how microplastics act as hosts of biofilms (creating the plastisphere). We have also presented the modern toolbox used for microplastic-biofilm analyses.

Connecting The Dots: Livestock Animals As Missing Links In The Chain Of Microplastic Contamination And Human Health,"Simple Summary The environmental issue posed by the distribution of plastic is largely due to their fragmentation into micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), which are spread across aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial ecosystems. The discovery that these particles can easily accumulate in aquatic organisms and edible plants has rapidly drawn global attention to their potential impact on human health. Therefore, based on the One Health approach, this paper will first provide an overview of soil contamination as well as human exposure routes and toxicity pathways of MNPs. It then describes the significant role of livestock animals as a critical link between soil and human exposure, focusing on the lack of the available literature and on the role of livestock animals as reservoirs and carriers of MNP contamination along the food chain. The lack of a standardized method to detect, quantify, and characterize plastic particles in different matrices prevents the determination of their realistic load. For this reason, the development of a database where researchers can document data, both on MNP characteristics and assessment procedures, is also suggested with the perspective of training, in the future, artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of predicting the most abundant/dangerous polymer(s) and help in guiding decisions to reduce risks to global health.Abstract Plastic pollution is a global diffuse threat, especially considering its fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). Since the contamination of the aquatic environment is already well studied, most studies have now focused on the soil. Moreover, the number of studies on the exposure routes and toxic effects of MNPs in humans is continuously increasing. Although MNPs can cause inflammation, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and immune toxicity in livestock animals, which can accumulate ingested/inhaled plastic particles and transfer them to humans through the food chain, research on this topic is still lacking. In considering farm animals as the missing link between soil/plant contamination and human health effects, this paper aims to describe their importance as carriers and vectors of MNP contamination. As research on this topic is in its early stages, there is no standard method to quantify the amount and the characteristics of MNPs in different matrices. Therefore, the creation of a common database where researchers can report data on MNP characteristics and quantification methods could be helpful for both method standardization and the future training of an AI tool for predicting the most abundant/dangerous polymer(s), thus supporting policy decisions to reduce plastic pollution and perfectly fitting with One Health principles.","Pause, Fc; Urli, S; Crociati, M; Stradaioli, G; Baufeld, A",10.3390/ani14020350,Animals
Microplastics Can Selectively Enrich Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistant Genes And Shape Different Microbial Communities In Aquatic Systems,"Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminants, are posing potential risks to environment, and animal and human health. The ubiquitous presence of MPs in natural ecosystems provides favorable platform to selectively adsorb antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacteria (ARB) and bacterial assemblages, especially in wastewater which is hotspot for MPs, ARGs and ARB. In this study, the selective capture of intracellular ARGs (iARGs), extracellular ARGs (eARGs), and bacterial assemblages by MPs with different materials (i.e. polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, and polyethylene terephthalate) and sizes (200 mu m and 100 mu m) was investigated. The results showed that iARGs (i.e. i-TetA, i-TetC, iTetO, i-sul1), integron-integrase gene (intI1), and eARGs (i.e. e-TetA and e-bla(TEM)) were selectively enriched on MPs. Relative abundances of i-sul1, i-TetA, and intI1 were generally higher than that of i-TetC and i-TetO on all MPs. Moreover, MPs also have strong effects on the formation of microflora in wastewater, which resulted in different bacterial communities and functions in the wastewater and on the MPs. These findings suggested that MPs could affect the selective enrichment of ARB and ARGs in water environment.","Zhang, S; Liu, Xx; Qiu, Px; Chen, B; Xu, Cm; Dong, Wl; Liu, T",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153488,Science Of The Total Environment

The anammox process, which plays a crucial role in nitrogen removal from wastewater, is particularly sensitive to external pollutants. This paper endeavors to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the inhibition mechanisms of multi-antibiotic on anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, along with insights into their recovery processes. The paper dives deeply into the various ways antibiotics interact with anammox bacteria, focusing specifically on their interference with the bacteria's extracellular polymers (EPS) - crucial components that maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the cells. Additionally, it explores how anammox bacteria utilize quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms to regulate their community structure and respond to antibiotic stress. Moreover, the paper summarizes effective removal methods for these antibiotics from wastewater systems, which is crucial for mitigating their inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria. Finally, the paper offers valuable insights into how anammox communities can recuperate from multi-antibiotic stress. This includes strategies for reintroducing healthy bacteria, optimizing operational conditions, and using bioaugmentation techniques to enhance the resilience of anammox communities. In summary, this paper not only enriches our understanding of the complex interactions between antibiotics and anammox bacteria but also provides theoretical and practical guidance for the treatment of antibiotic pollution in sewage, ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes.","Ji, X; Zhang, Xn; Ju, T; Zhou, L; Jin, D; Wu, P",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122754,Journal Of Environmental Management
Emerging Issues On Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Colonizing Plastic Waste In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) adhesion onto plastic substrates is a potential threat to environmental and human health. This current research investigates the prevalence of two relevant human pathogens, Staphylococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp., and their sophisticated equipment of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), retrieved from plastic substrates submerged into an inland water body. The results of microbiological analysis on selective and chromogenic media revealed the presence of colonies with distinctive phenotypes, which were identified using biochemical and molecular methods. 16S rDNA sequencing and BLAST analysis confirmed the presence of Klebsiella spp., while in the case of Staphylococcus spp., 63.6% of strains were found to be members of Lysinibacillus spp., and the remaining 36.3% were identified as Exiguobacterium acetylicum. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay was performed to test the susceptibility of the isolates to nine commercially available antibiotics, while the genotypic resistant profile was determined for two genes of class 1 integrons and eighteen ARGs belonging to different classes of antibiotics. All isolated bacteria displayed a high prevalence of resistance against all tested antibiotics. These findings provide insights into the emerging risks linked to colonization by potential human opportunistic pathogens on plastic waste commonly found in aquatic ecosystems.","Ferheen, I; Spurio, R; Marcheggiani, S",10.3390/antibiotics13040339,Antibiotics-Basel
"Metagenomic Insights Into Taxonomic, Functional Diversity And Inhibitors Of Microbial Biofilms","Microbial cells attached to inert or living surfaces adopt biofilm mode with self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix containing polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, for protection from adverse external stimuli. Biofilms in hospitals and industries serve as a breeding ground for drug-resistant pathogens and ARG enrichment that are linked to pathogenicity and also impede industrial production process. Biofilm formation, including virulence and pathogenicity, is regulated through quorum sensing (QS), a means of bacterial cell to cell communication for cooperative physiological processes. Hence, QS inhibition through quorum quenching (QQ) is a feasible approach to inhibit biofilm formation. In contrast, biofilms have beneficial roles in promoting plant growth, biocontrol, and wastewater treatment. Furthermore, polymicrobial biofilms can harbour novel com-pounds and species of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. Hence, surveillance of biofilm microbiome structure and functional attributes is crucial to determine the extent of the risk it poses and to harness its bioactive potential. One of the most preferred approaches to delineate the microbiome is culture-independent metagenomics. In this context, this review article explores the biofilm microbiome in built and natural set-tings such as agriculture, household appliances, wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, microplastics, and dental biofilm. We have also discussed the recent reports on discoveries of novel QS and biofilm inhibitors through conventional, metagenomics, and machine learning approaches. Finally, we present biofilm-derived novel metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), genomes, and taxa of medical and industrial interest.","Imchen, M; Anju, Vt; Busi, S; Mohan, Ms; Subhaswaraj, P; Dyavaiah, M; Kumavath, R",10.1016/j.micres.2022.127207,Microbiological Research

"Metagenomic Insights Into The Functional Potential Of Non-Sanitary Landfill Microbiomes In The Indian Himalayan Region, Highlighting Key Plastic Degrading Genes","Solid waste management in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is a growing challenge, intensified by increasing population and tourism, which strain non-sanitary landfills. This study investigates microbial diversity and functional capabilities within these landfills using a high-throughput shotgun metagenomic approach. Physicochemical analysis revealed that the Manali and Mandi landfill sites were under heavy metal contamination and thermal stress. Taxonomic annotation identified a dominance of bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, with genera like Pseudomonas and Bacillus prevalent. Squeezemeta analysis generated 9,216,983 open reading frames (ORFs) across the sampling sites, highlighting diverse metabolic potentials for heavy metal resistance and degrading organic, xenobiotics and plastic wastes. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) identified distinct gene clusters in Manali and Mandi landfill sites, reflecting differences in pollution profiles. Functional redundancy of landfill microbiome was observed with notable xenobiotic and plastic degradation pathways. This is the first comprehensive metagenomic assessment of non-sanitary landfills in the IHR, providing valuable insights into the microbial roles in degrading persistent pollutants, plastic waste, and other contaminants in these stressed environments.","Lepcha, A; Kumar, R; Dindhoria, K; Bhargava, B; Pati, Am; Kumar, R",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136642,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastic Leachate Exposure Drives Antibiotic Resistance And Virulence In Marine Bacterial Communities,"Plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. Plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. However, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assem-blages on plastic surfaces. It is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. Here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and AMR within a seawater microcosm community. We show that PVC leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in AMR and virulence genes. In particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches AMR genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. Additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. This study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health.","Vlaanderen, Ej; Ghaly, Tm; Moore, Lr; Focardi, A; Paulsen, It; Tetu, Sg",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121558,Environmental Pollution
Dissemination Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Associated With Microplastics Collected From Monastir And Mahdia Coasts (Tunisia),"The exponential use of plastics and their recalcitrant nature leads to their significant accumulation in the environment. The occurrence of plastic wastes is considered as a serious environmental problem. Additionally, plastic wastes can break down into smaller pieces called microplastics (MPs), leading to further interactions with the environment and living organisms. In this study, sixty-six strains were isolated from microplastic particles collected on different coastal areas of Monastir and Mahdia (Tunisia). The different bacterial isolates were identified according to some biochemical tests such as catalase, oxidase, and were subjected to molecular characterization. Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) revealed the presence of 31 ITS haplotypes. The partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA of representative strains was analyzed. The majority of bacterial isolates (84.31 %) belonged to Gamma-proteobacteria (84.78 %), while the remaining isolates were affiliated to Firmicutes (15.21 %). The microplastic-associated bacterial isolates belonged to 10 genera, namely Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Shewanella, Aeromonas, Vibrio, Stutzerimonas, Exiguobacterium, Enterobacter. Among the well-represented Acinetobacter genus, the most common species identified was Acinetobacter johnsonii. Susceptibility patterns of these strains were studied against 21 antibiotics commonly used in Tunisia. A high level of antibiotic resistance was observed for Penicillin G (97.82 %) and Temocillin (86.95 %). S26 strain presented the highest multidrug resistance with a multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.71.","Hassen, W; Danioux, A; Oueslati, A; Santana-Rodríguez, Jj; Sire, O; Sedrati, M; Ben Mansour, H",10.1016/j.micpath.2024.107193,Microbial Pathogenesis
Role Of Microplastics In Microbial Community Structure And Functions In Urban Soils,"Evidence from the laboratory suggests that microplastics (MPs) can harm soil microorganisms, affecting the structures and functions of microbial communities. The impact of soil MPs on microbes in actual urban environments with high human activity levels, however, has not been well reported. To investigate the MP effect on urban soil microorganisms under complex scenarios, we analyzed 42 soil samples from standardized plots of 7 urban functional zones. We report that urban green spaces are important for studying microbial diversity in the study area, and they also contribute to the global homogenization of soil microbes and genes. Bacterial communities in soils enriched with various MPs showed greater differences in OTUs than fungi. Compared to low-MP soils, most ARGs and nutrient cycling genes had similar or slightly lower abundances in soils with high levels of MPs. The coupling of pollutant factors with MPs as independent variables had significant explanatory power for both positive and negative correlations in PLS-PM analysis. Specifically, PET and PP MPs explained 3.54% and 6.03%, respectively, of the microbial community and functional genes. This study fills knowledge gaps on the effects of MPs on urban soil microbial communities in real environments, facilitating better management of urban green spaces.","Zhou, Yj; Zhou, Sl",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132141,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastic Polymers And Antibiotic Resistance In An Antarctic Environment (Ross Sea): Are We Revealing The Tip Of An Iceberg?,"Microbial colonization of plastic polymers in Antarctic environments is an under-investigated issue. While several studies are documenting the spread of plastic pollution in the Ross Sea, whether the formation of a plastisphere (namely the complex microbial assemblage colonizing plastics) may favor the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in this marine environment is unknown yet. A colonization experiment was performed in this ecosystem, aiming at exploring the potential role of plastic polymers as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance. To this end, the biofilm-producing activity and the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of bacterial strains isolated from biofilms colonizing submerged polyvinylchloride and polyethylene panels were screened. The colonization experiment was carried out at two different sites of the Ross Sea, namely Road Bay and Tethys Bay. Most of bacterial isolates were able to produce biofilm; several multidrug resistances were detected in the bacterial members of biofilms associated to PVC and PE (also named as the plastisphere), as well as in the bacterial strains isolated from the surrounding water. The lowest percentage of ARB was found in the PE-associated plastisphere from the not-impacted (control) Punta Stocchino station, whereas the highest one was detected in the PVC-associated plastisphere from the Tethys Bay station. However, no selective enrichment of ARB in relation to the study sites or to either type of plastic material was observed, suggesting that resistance to antibiotics was a generalized widespread phenomenon. Resistance against to all the three classes of antibiotics assayed in this study (i.e., cell wall antibiotics, nucleic acids, and protein synthesis inhibitors) was observed. The high percentage of bacterial isolates showing resistance in remote environments like Antarctic ones, suffering increasing anthropic pressure, points out an emerging threat with a potential pathogenic risk that needs further deepening studies.","Caruso, G; Azzaro, M; Dell'Acqua, O; Papale, M; Lo Giudice, A; Laganà, P",10.3390/microorganisms12102083,Microorganisms
Covid-19 And Antimicrobial Resistance: A Cross-Study,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as a severe concern due to the escalating instances of resistant human pathogens encountered by health workers. Consequently, there is a shortage of antibiotics to treat Multidrug Resistance (MDR) and Extensively Drug Resistance (XDR) patients. The primary cause of AMR is the vast array of anthropogenic disturbances in natural microfauna brought about by the extensive use of antibiotics. Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has crashed antibiotic stewardship and single-handedly increased the global usage of antibiotics, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and biocide, causing a ripple effect in the existing global AMR problem. This surge in antibiotic usage has escalated the residual antibiotics reaching Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) from pharmaceutical companies, health care centers, and domestic settings. Ultimately the natural water bodies receiving their effluents will have higher concentrations of emerging contaminants as the WWTPs cannot remove the Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) completely. Furthermore, increased biocides usage will increase AMR by co-resistance, and increasing plastics will turn into microplastics and get converted to plastisphere, which will further enhance its propagation. Therefore, it is crucial to curb antibiotic usage, implement antibiotic stewardship dynamically; and, ameliorate the present condition of WWTPs to remove residual PPCPs efficiently. The need of the hour is to address the grave threat of AMR, which is loitering silently; if not the mankind will endure more affliction hereafter.

Deciphering The Mechanisms Shaping The Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistome On Riverine Microplastics,"Microplastics in urban rivers provide bacterial niches and serve as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) dissemination, which may exacerbate risks in the aquatic systems. However, whether MPs in the river would also selectively enrich ARGs and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on MPs remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the occurrence of ARGs, bacterial communities, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) on MPs and in waters from the Huangpu River in China. Microplastics were widely distributed in the river (1.78 +/- 0.84 items/L), with overwhelming percentages of polyethylene terephthalate fibers. Although reduced ARG abundances were observed on MPs than in waters, MPs selectively enriched the ARGs resistant to Rifamycin and Vancomycin. A clear variation for ARG profiles was elucidated between water and MPs samples. Network analysis suggested that MPs created a unique niche for the genus Afipia to colonize, potentially contributing to the vertical dissemination of ARGs. Additionally, the co-occurrence between ARGs and MGEs revealed that the MPs favor the propagation of some plasmid-associated ARGs mediated by horizontal gene transfer. The null model-based stochasticity ratio and the neutral community model suggested that the ARG assembly on MPs was dominantly driven by stochastic process. The results further indicated that microbial communities and MGEs played significant roles in shaping ARG profiles and dynamics on MPs. Our findings provided new insights into the ecological processes of antibiotic resistome of the aquatic plastisphere.","Xu, Cy; Lu, Jw; Shen, Cs; Wang, J; Li, F",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119192,Water Research
"Plastisphere Characterization In Habitat Of The Highly Endangered Shinisaurus Crocodilurus: Bacterial Composition, Assembly, Function And The Comparison With Surrounding Environment","Plastisphere is a new niche for microorganisms that complicate the ecological effects of plastics, and may profoundly influence biodiversity and habitat conservation. The DaGuishan National Nature Reserve, one of the largest habitats of the highly endangered crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus), is experiencing plastic pollution without sufficient attention. Here, plastisphere collected from captive tanks of crocodile lizards in this nature reserve was characterized for the first time. Three types of plastic (PE-PP, PE1, and PE2) together with the surrounding water and soil samples, were collected, and 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to characterize the bacterial composition. The results demonstrated that plastisphere was driven by stochastic process and had a distinct bacterial community with higher diversity than that in surrounding water (p < 0.05). Bacteria related to nitrogen and carbon cycles (Pseudomonas psychrotolerans, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum) were more abundant in plastisphere than in water or soil (p < 0.05). More importantly, plastics recruited pathogens and those bacteria function in antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) coding. Bacteria related to polymer degradation also proliferated in plastisphere, especially Bacillus subtilis with a fold change of 42.01. The PE2 plastisphere, which had the lowest diversity and was dominated by Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum differed from PE 1 and PE-PP plastispheres totally. Plastics' morphology and aquatic nutrient levels contributed to the heterogeneity of different plastispheres. Overall, this study demonstrated that plastispheres diversify in composition and function, affecting ecosystem services directly or indirectly. Pathogens and bacteria related to ARGs expression enriched in the plastisphere should not be ignored because they may threaten the health of crocodile lizards by increasing the risk of infection. Plastic pollution control should be included in conservation efforts for crocodile lizards. This study provides new insights into the potential impacts of plastisphere, which is important for ecological risk assessments of plastic pollution in the habitats of endangered species.","Xie, Mj; Lv, M; Zhao, Zw; Li, Lm; Jiang, Hy; Yu, Yp; Zhang, Xj; Liu, P; Chen, Jp",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165807,Science Of The Total Environment

"Do Contaminants Compromise The Use Of Recycled Nutrients In Organic Agriculture? A Review And Synthesis Of Current Knowledge On Contaminant Concentrations, Fate In The Environment And Risk Assessment","Use of nutrients recycled from societal waste streams in agriculture is part of the circular economy, and in with organic farming principles. Nevertheless, diverse contaminants in waste streams create doubts among organic farmers about potential risks for soil health. Here, we gather the current knowledge on contaminant levels in waste streams and recycled nutrient sources, and discuss associated risks. For potentially toxic elements (PTEs), the input of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) from mineral feed supplements remains of concern, while con- centrations of PTEs in many waste streams have decreased substantially in Europe. The same applies to organic contaminants, although new chemical groups such as flame retardants are of emerging concern and globally contamination levels differ strongly. Compared to inorganic fertilizers, application of organic fertilizers derived from human or animal feces is associated with an increased risk for environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance. The risk depends on the quality of the organic fertilizers, which varies between geographical regions, but farmland application of sewage sludge appears to be a safe practice as shown by some studies (e.g. from Sweden). Microplastic concentrations in agricultural soils show a wide spread and our understanding of its toxicity is limited, hampering a sound risk assessment. Methods for assessing public health risks for organic contaminants must include emerging contaminants and potential interactions of multiple compounds. Evidence from long-term field experiments suggests that soils may be more resilient and capable to degrade or stabilize pollutants than often assumed. In view of the need to source nutrients for expanding areas under organic farming, we discuss inputs originating from conventional farms vs. non-agricultural (i.e. societal) inputs. Closing nutrient cycles between agriculture and society is feasible in many cases, without being compromised by con- taminants, and should be enhanced, aided by improved source control, waste treatment and sound risk assessments.","Bünemann, Ek; Reimer, M; Smolders, E; Smith, Sr; Bigalke, M; Palmqvist, A; Brandt, Kk; Möller, K; Harder, R; Hermann, L; Speiser, B; Oudshoorn, F; Loes, Ak; Magid, J",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168901,Science Of The Total Environment
"The Acinetobacter Baumannii Two-Component System Aders Regulates Genes Required For Multidrug Efflux, Biofilm Formation, And Virulence In A Strain-Specific Manner","The opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is able to persist in the environment and is often multidrug resistant (MDR), causing difficulties in the treatment of infections. Here, we show that the two-component system AdeRS, which regulates the production of the AdeABC multidrug resistance efflux pump, is required for the formation of a protective biofilm in an ex vivo porcine mucosal model, which mimics a natural infection of the human epithelium. Interestingly, deletion of adeB impacted only on the ability of strain AYE to form a biofilm on plastic and only on the virulence of strain Singapore 1 for Galleria mellonella. RNA-Seq revealed that loss of AdeRS or AdeB significantly altered the transcriptional landscape, resulting in the changed expression of many genes, notably those associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence interactions. For example, A. baumannii lacking AdeRS displayed decreased expression of adeABC, pil genes, com genes, and a pgaC-like gene, whereas loss of AdeB resulted in increased expression of pil and com genes and decreased expression of ferric acinetobactin transport system genes. These data define the scope of AdeRS-mediated regulation, show that changes in the production of AdeABC mediate important phenotypes controlled by AdeRS, and suggest that AdeABC is a viable target for antimicrobial drug and antibiofilm discovery. IMPORTANCE Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen and is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide. This organism is often multidrug resistant, can persist in the environment, and forms a biofilm on environmental surfaces and wounds. Overproduction of efflux pumps can allow specific toxic compounds to be pumped out of the cell and can lead to multidrug resistance. This study demonstrates the role of the A. baumannii efflux pump AdeB, and its regulator AdeRS, in multidrug resistance, epithelial cell killing, and biofilm formation. Deletion of the genes encoding these systems led to increased susceptibility to antibiotics, decreased biofilm formation on biotic and abiotic surfaces, and decreased virulence. Our data suggest that inhibition of AdeB could prevent biofilm formation or colonization in patients by A. baumannii and provides a good target for drug discovery.","Richmond, Ge; Evans, Lp; Anderson, Mj; Wand, Me; Bonney, Lc; Ivens, A; Chua, Kl; Webber, Ma; Sutton, Jm; Peterson, Ml; Piddock, Ljv",10.1128/mBio.00430-16,Mbio
"Selectively Enrichment Of Antibiotics And Args By Microplastics In River, Estuary And Marine Waters","The partition of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between the microplastics (MPs) and the surrounding water with various salinity are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that adsorption of antibiotics on MPs might cause a significant change of the structure of microbial communities, diversity and abundance of ARGs on MPs and this might be further affected by change of salinity. In this study, we investigated adsorption of four common antibiotics (sulfamerazine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and tylosin) to polyethylene (PE) MPs in river, estuary and marine waters, and the differences of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities on MPs and in the three waters. The results showed that MPs can enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbes from the surrounding water. Elevated salinity could reduce adsorption of antibiotics to MPs and the abundance of ARGs. For example, MPs can concentrate more antibiotics and ARGs in the fresh river water than in the estuary and the marine waters. In addition, ARGs and bacterial communities on MPs at various salinity were significantly different under the pressure of four antibiotics. On MPs, sull, sulA/folP-01, tetA, tetC, tetX and ermE increased significantly but a few new ARGs such as sulA/folP-01 and tetA appeared. The structure of the bacterial communities on MPs was different from the surrounding water since some bacteria species found on MPs were barely detected in the surrounding water while some genera on MPs vanished after exposure to antibiotics. As the antibiotics adsorbed and the ARGs on MPs decreased with the water salinity, the structure of the communities on MPs thus varied with salinity change. These findings are important to understand the effects of MPs on the transport, fate and ecological risk of antibiotics and ARGs in different aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study is significant as it highlights a new potential route of dispersal of such antibiotic-resistance in the environment, which may act as carriers of such bacteria by introducing them into new marine ecosystems, as well as potential pathways having impacts on animal and human health, until their final interaction with the human foodchain.","Moore, Re; Millar, Bc; Moore, Je",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110702,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Distribution Patterns And Antibiotic Resistance Profiles Of Bacterial Pathogens Among Patients With Wound Infections In The Jiaxing Region From 2021 To 2023,"Purpose: To systematically assess the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens in wound infections, and analyze risk factors associated with multidrug resistance (MDR). Patients and Methods: Retrospectively analyzing Jiaxing-region medical records between January 2021 and December 2023, we identified a cohort of 461 wound infection patients. Cultures were grown on various agars, with bacteria identified via Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms were conducted by VITEK 2 system, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and Epsilometer test. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for statistical analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to pinpoint risk factors for multidrugresistant organism (MDRO) infections and predict occurrences. Results: From 461 patients, 549 bacterial pathogens were isolated, predominantly consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae , and Enterococcus faecalis . Vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline maintained their efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species , while Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated sensitivity to aminoglycosides. Conversely, Escherichia coli exhibited high amoxicillin resistance (85.4%). More than half of the isolates were resistant to levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, and gentamicin, with Acinetobacter baumannii strains showing considerable resistance (65.8-68.4%) to advanced cephalosporins and carbapenems. Within this group, 58 MDROs were detected, primarily originating from Burn Plastic Surgery, Emergency, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) departments. Multivariate logistic regression identified hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgery, extended hospitalization, and exposure to multiple antibiotic classes as independent risk factors for MDRO wound infections. Based on these findings, a predictive model for MDRO occurrence in wounds was constructed, which had a sensitivity of 0.627, specificity of 0.933, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.838. Conclusion: Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in wound infections with differential antibiotic resistance. Independent risk factors included hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgery, extended hospitalization, and polyantibiotic use. We urge prioritizing culture, susceptibility tests, and personalized antibiotic strategies to address MDRO risks and improve wound infection management specificity and efficacy.","Wang, C; Niu, Xq; Bao, Sw; Shen, Wf; Jiang, Cy",10.2147/IDR.S470401,Infection And Drug Resistance
Two New Sgi1-Lk Variants Found In Proteus Mirabilis And Evolution Of The Sgi1-Hkl Group Of Salmonella Genomic Islands,"Integrative mobilizable elements belonging to the SGI1-H, -K, and -L Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) variant groups are distinguished by the presence of an alteration in the backbone (IS1359 replaces 2.8 kb of the backbone extending from within traN [S005] to within S009). Members of this SGI1-HKL group have been found in Salmonella enterica serovars and in Proteus mirabilis. Two novel variants from this group, designated SGI1-LK1 and SGI1-LK2, were found in the draft genomes of antibiotic-resistant P. mirabilis isolates from two French hospitals. Both variants can be derived from SGI1-PmGUE, a configuration found previously in another P. mirabilis isolate from France. SGI1-LK1 could arise via an IS26-mediated inversion in the complex class 1 integron that duplicated the IS26 element and the target site in IS6100. SGI1-LK1 also has a larger 8.59-kb backbone deletion extending from traN to within S013 and removing traG and traH. However, SGI1-LK1 was mobilized by an IncC plasmid. SGI1- LK2 can be derived from a hypothetical progenitor, SGI1-LK0, that is related to SGI1-PmGUE but lacks the aphA1 gene and one copy of IS26. The integron of SGI1-LK2 could arise via deletion of DNA adjacent to an IS26 and a deletion occurring via homologous recombination between duplicated copies of part of the integron 3'-conserved segment. SGI1-K can also be derived from SGI1- LK0. This would involve an IS26-mediated deletion and an inversion via homologous recombination of a segment between inversely oriented IS26s. Similar events can explain the configuration of the integrons in other SGI1-LK variants. IMPORTANCE Members of the SGI1-HKL subgroup of SGI1-type integrative mobilizable elements have a characteristic alteration in their backbone. They are widely distributed among multiply antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovars and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The SGI1-K type, found in the globally disseminated multiply antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky clone ST198 (sequence type 198), and various configurations in the original SGI1-LK group, found in other multiresistant S. enterica serovars and Proteus mirabilis isolates, have complex and highly plastic resistance regions due to the presence of IS26. However, how these complex forms arose and the relationships between them had not been analyzed. Here, a hypothetical progenitor, SGI1-LK0, that can be formed from the simpler SGI1-H is proposed, and the pathways to the formation of new variants, SGI1-LK1 and SGI1-LK2, found in P. mirabilis and other reported configurations via homologous recombination and IS26-mediated events are proposed. This led to a better understanding of the evolution of the SGI1-HKL group.","De Curraize, C; Siebor, E; Varin, V; Neuwirth, C; Hall, Rm",10.1128/mSphere.00875-19,Msphere
Co-Selection Of Multi-Antibiotic Resistance In Bacterial Pathogens In Metal And Microplastic Contaminated Environments: An Emerging Health Threat,"Misuse/over use of antibiotics increases the threats to human health since this is a main reason behind evolution of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. However, metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, copper and cadmium are accumulating to critical concentration in the environment and triggering co-selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The co-selection of metal driven antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved through co-resistance or cross resistance. Metal driven antibiotic resistant determinants evolved in bacteria and present on same mobile genetic elements are horizontally transferred to distantly related bacterial human pathogens. Additionally, in marine environment persistent pollutants like microplastics is recognized as a vector for the proliferation of metal/antibiotics and human pathogens. Recently published research confirmed that horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distinct microbes present on microplastics is much faster than free living microbes. Therefore, micro plastics act as an emerging hotspot for metal driven co-selection of multidrug resistant human pathogens and pose serious threat to humans which do recreational activities in marine environment and ingest marine derived foods. Therefore, marine environment co-polluted with metal, antibiotics, human pathogens and microplastics pose an emerging health threat globally. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Microplastics Accumulation In Mangroves Increasing The Resistance Of Its Colonization Vibrio And Shewanella,"The enrichment of various pollutants in mangrove has attracted widespread attention. Especially, microplastics accumulation in mangrove may provide a more challenging ecological colonization site by enriching pollutants, thus affecting the change of microplastics antibiotic resistance and increasing the risk of antibiotic failure. Herein, the antibiotic-resistant of microplastics and sediment from mangrove were investigated. The results show that isolates are mainly colonized by Vibrio parahemolyticus (V. parahemolyticus), Vibrio alginolyticus (V. alginolyticus), and Shewanella. 100% mangrove microplastics isolates are resistant to chloramphenicol, cefazolin, and tetracycline, especially amoxicillin clavulanate and ampicillin. Meanwhile, the multiple antibiotics resistance (MAR) indexes of V. parahaemolyticus, Shewanella, and V. alginolyticus in mangrove microplastics are 0.72, 0.77, and 0.77, respectively, which are far higher than the MAR index standard (0.2) and that of mangrove sediment isolates. Furthermore, compared with V. parahaemolyticus isolated from the same mangrove microplastics, Shewanella and V. alginolyticus show stronger drug resistance. It should be noted that there is a closely related relationship between the type of microplastics and the antibiotics resistance of isolated bacteria. For the antibiotics sensitivity test of norfloxacin, streptomycin, amoxicillin, and chloramphenicol, V. parahaemolyticus have the lower antibiotics resistance than that of V. alginolyticus isolated from the same mangrove microplastics. However, Vibrio isolated from PE has stronger antibiotics resistance.

Global Performance And Trends Of Research On Emerging Contaminants In Sewage Sludge: A Bibliometric Analysis From 1990 To 2023,"The pervasive occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in sewage sludge (SWS) poses significant safety challenges concerning the processing, disposal, and secure application, ultimately jeopardizing both human health and the ecological environment. To comprehensively comprehend the evolutionary trajectories, present state, and research advancements in the field of ECs in SWS, a systematic was conducted, scrutinizing the annual publication quantity, disciplinary distribution, core authors, involved nations/regions, pertinent keywords, and citation status of 2082 research publications related to ECs in SWS from 1990 to 2023. The results indicate a substantial upward trajectory in the research literature pertaining to ECs in SWS. The study of ECs in SWS encompasses 78 disciplines, including Environmental Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Water Resources. China, Spain, and the USA ranked among the top three countries in terms of both total publications and citation frequency. The majority of publications were published in reputable high-impact journals such as Science of the Total Environment, Chemosphere, and Bioresource Technology. Based on high-frequency keywords, co-occurrence networks of keywords, and keywords burst analysis, it is found that the occurrence and environment behavior of ECs in SWS (ARGs, microplastics, PPCPs, and POPs), the detection and analytical methods, the impact on SWS treatment and disposal processes, and the accumulation and ecological risks in plants and soil during SWS land utilization, are the main research directions and hot topics in this field.

"Carriage Rate Of Neisseria Meningitidis, Antibiotic Susceptibility Pattern And Associated Risk Factors Among Primary School Children In Gondar Town, Northwest Ethiopia","Background Globally, in 2012, about 1.2 million estimated cases were reported with similar to 135,000 deaths annually. In Ethiopia, specifically in our study area, limited information is found on the oropharyngeal carriage, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and associated risk factors for N. meningitidis among school children. So, the aim of this study was to assess oropharyngeal carriage rate of N. meningitidis, antibiotic susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors among primary school children in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted from January to April, 2019 in Gondar town. Multi stage simple random sampling technique was used. A total of 524 oropharyngeal swabs were collected using sterile plastic cotton swabs. Modified Thayer Martin media was used for primary isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was done based on Kirby-Bauer method on Muller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance of an isolate to two or more antimicrobial classes tested. Logistic regression model was used to see the association between dependent variables (Carriage rate of Neisseria meningitidis, Serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis and Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns) and independent variables (Socio-demographic data and risk factors). Variables with a P- value <= 0.2 during bivariable analysis was taken to multivariable analysis to check significant association of meningococcal carriage with risk factors. Finally, a P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data was summarized using numbers, percentages and tables. Results A total of 53(10.1%) (CI: 7.6-12.8) N. meningitidis isolates were identified. Serogroup A 13 (24.5%) was the most prevalent followed by Y/W135 11(20.7%) whereas serogroup B 4(7.6%) was the least identified serotype. Meningococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (45.3%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.6%). Overall, most of meningococcal isolates showed about 32(60.4%) multidrug resistance. Meningococcal carriage rate was significantly associated with family size, tonsillectomy, passive smoking, number of students per class, sharing utensils, history of visiting healthcare institutions, and indoor kitchen. Conclusion This study highlights the need for reinforcement of case-based, laboratory confirmed surveillance of N. meningitidis carriage in Ethiopian elementary school students to enable mapping of distribution of serotypes of the causative organisms across the country and determine the current potential necessity of vaccination.","Tefera, Z; Mekonnen, F; Tiruneh, M; Belachew, T",10.1186/s12879-020-05080-w,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Drug Resistance In Cancers: A Free Pass For Bullying,"The cancer burden continues to grow globally, and drug resistance remains a substantial challenge in cancer therapy. It is well established that cancerous cells with clonal dysplasia generate the same carcinogenic lesions. Tumor cells pass on genetic templates to subsequent generations in evolutionary terms and exhibit drug resistance simply by accumulating genetic alterations. However, recent evidence has implied that tumor cells accumulate genetic alterations by progressively adapting. As a result, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is generated due to genetically distinct subclonal populations of cells coexisting. The genetic adaptive mechanisms of action of ITH include activating cellular plasticity, through which tumor cells create a tumor-supportive microenvironment in which they can proliferate and cause increased damage. These highly plastic cells are located in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and undergo extreme changes to resist therapeutic drugs. Accordingly, the underlying mechanisms involved in drug resistance have been re-evaluated. Herein, we will reveal new themes emerging from initial studies of drug resistance and outline the findings regarding drug resistance from the perspective of the TME; the themes include exosomes, metabolic reprogramming, protein glycosylation and autophagy, and the relates studies aim to provide new targets and strategies for reversing drug resistance in cancers.","Li, J; Li, X; Guo, Q",10.3390/cells11213383,Cells
Impact Of Antibiotics On Microbial Community In Aquatic Environment And Biodegradation Mechanism: A Review And Bibliometric Analysis,"Antibiotic residues in aquatic environments pose a potential hazard, and microbes, which play important roles in aquatic ecosystems, are vulnerable to the impacts of antibiotics. This study aimed to analyze the research progress, trends, and hot topics of the impact of antibiotics on microbial community and biodegradation mechanism using bibliometric analysis. An in-depth analysis of the publication characteristics of 6143 articles published between 1990 and 2021 revealed that the number of articles published increased exponentially. The research sites have been mainly concentrated in the Yamuna River, Pearl River, Lake Taihu, Lake Michigan, Danjiangkou Reservoir, etc., illustrating that research around the world is not even. Antibiotics could change the diversity, structure, and ecological functions of bacterial communities, stimulate a widespread abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes, and increase the diversity of eukaryotes, thus triggering the shift of food web structure to predatory and pathogenic. Latent Dirichlet allocation theme model analysis showed three clusters, and the research hotspots mainly included the effect of antibiotics on the denitrification process, microplastics combined with antibiotics, and methods for removing antibiotics. Furthermore, the mechanisms of microbe-mediated antibiotic degradation were unraveled, and importantly, we provided bottlenecks and future research perspectives on antibiotics and microbial diversity research.","Mu, Xy; Huang, Zh; Ohore, Oe; Yang, Jj; Peng, K; Li, Sk; Li, X",10.1007/s11356-023-27018-w,Environmental Science And Pollution Research
"The Risk Factors, Etiology, And Drug Resistance Of Infection After Plastic Surgery, And Corresponding Measures","BACKGROUND: Explore the risk factors, etiology, and drug resistance of infection after plastic surgery, and present corresponding measures. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 980 patients who underwent head and facial plastic surgery from January 2013 to December 2015. Postoperative infection occurred in 169 patients. We analyzed the distribution of pathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing plastic surgery, reviewed the drug resistance of Gram negative (G(-)) bacteria and Gram positive (G(+)) bacteria, and analyzed the effects of surgical duration, prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, length of stay (LOS), and preoperative hair removal on infection after plastic surgery. RESULTS: G(+) bacteria (mainly Staphylococcus aureus) accounted for 45.6%, while G(-) bacteria (mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) accounted for 54.4% of total pathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing plastic surgery. The most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefotaxime; the most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Klebsiella pneumoniae were sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. The most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Staphylococcus aureus were penicillin G, ampicillin, and sulfamethoxazole; for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, the most commonly resistant antibacterial agents were also penicillin G, ampicillin, and sulfamethoxazole. Both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Multi-factor logistic regression analysis showed that surgical duration >3 hours, no prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, and LOS>7 days were independent risk factors for postoperative infection. CONCLUSIONS: G(-) bacteria were more prevalent in infections after plastic surgery, and most bacteria were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Strict control of surgical duration, short LOS, intraoperative prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, and no preoperative hair removal were important for reducing postoperative infection.","Wang, Gn; Zhang, Sh",10.23736/S0026-4733.17.07295-9,Minerva Chirurgica
Plastic Debris In The Aquatic Environment: An Emerging Substratum For Antimicrobial Resistant (Amr) Biofilms,"Plastic pollution has quadrupled over the past years and has become a global concern due to its direct impact on life forms. The present study analysed whether the plastic debris in aquatic environments could act as the substratum for the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria to form biofilm for survival. We have collected various plastic debris (n = 32) from six sites of the Periyar River, the drinking water source for the entire city and one of the most polluted rivers in Kerala (India). The chemical composition of plastics was screened via FTIR analysis and found that they comprised two types, viz., polyethylene and polypropylene. Bacteria isolated from the samples were screened for the AMR characteristics towards eight different classes of antibiotics. All isolates showed 100% resistance towards colistin and obtained the MAR index value of 0.1-0.4 range. Six representative bacterial isolates with high multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index were selected and identified by 16sRNA sequencing as Lysinibacillus mangiferihumi, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus altitudins and Bacillus pumilus. In vitro biofilm formation was experimented on the purchased plastic samples in artificial media and river water using two selected strains, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus cereus. Significant variations were observed in biofilm growth in different media (P < 0.05) regardless of plastic types (P > 0.05). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the characteristic holes on the surface morphology were visualized in SEM analysis, thus indicating the conditioning of the plastics by the isolates for biofilm formation.","Suresh, S; Ambily, Ska; Chandran, P",10.1007/s00244-024-01086-6,Archives Of Environmental Contamination And Toxicology
"Wastewater Plastisphere Enhances Antibiotic Resistant Elements, Bacterial Pathogens, And Toxicological Impacts In The Environment","Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles with a size <5 mm that have raised alarming concerns owing to their ecological and human health impacts. They are largely released into the environment through the dumping of plastic waste and wastewater from treatment plants, domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial sources. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are unable to remove micro and nano-sized plastic particles, which end up in the natural aquatic and terrestrial environment, causing multifaceted toxic impacts. Moreover, plastics in wastewater generate biofilm that potentially enriches antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs), antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), and bacterial pathogens, which can largely impact antibiotic resistance development among organisms in the environment and transfer to humans through the food chain. Therefore, the current review aims to highlight the potential role of wastewater plastisphere in the enrichment and dissemination of ARBs, ARGs, and potential bacterial pathogens through mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the environment. Further, the interaction of wastewater MPs with organic and inorganic contaminants and the associated ecological and human health impacts have been presented. Last but not the least, control strategies and future research perspectives on wastewater plastisphere are also highlighted.","Junaid, M; Liu, Sl; Liao, Hp; Liu, Xy; Wu, Y; Wang, J",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156805,Science Of The Total Environment
"Sewage-Associated Plastic Waste Washed Up On Beaches Can Act As A Reservoir For Faecal Bacteria, Potential Human Pathogens, And Genes For Antimicrobial Resistance","Sewage-associated plastic wastes, such as wet wipes and cotton bud sticks, commonly wash up on beaches; however, it is unclear whether this represents a public health risk. In this study, sewage-associated plastic waste, and naturally occurring substrates (seaweed and sand), were collected from ten beaches along the Firth of Forth estuary (Scotland, UK) and analysed using selective media for the faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) E. coli and intestinal enterococci (IE), and potential human pathogens (Vibrio spp.). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis was used to determine antibiotic resistance in selected strains. FIOs and Vibrio were more often associated with wet wipes and cotton bud sticks than with seaweed, and there was evidence of resistance to several antibiotics. This work demonstrates that plastics associated with sewage pollution can facilitate the survival and dissemination of FIOs and Vibrio and thus, could present an as yet unquantified potential risk to human health at the beach.","Metcalf, R; White, Hl; Moresco, V; Ormsby, Mj; Oliver, Dm; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113766,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Microenvironment-Driven Dynamic Heterogeneity And Phenotypic Plasticity As A Mechanism Of Melanoma Therapy Resistance,"Drug resistance constitutes a major challenge in designing melanoma therapies. Microenvironment-driven tumor heterogeneity and plasticity play a key role in this phenomenon. Melanoma is highly heterogeneous with diverse genomic alterations and expression of different biological markers. In addition, melanoma cells are highly plastic and capable of adapting quickly to changing microenvironmental conditions. These contribute to variations in therapy response and durability between individual melanoma patients. In response to changing microenvironmental conditions, like hypoxia and nutrient starvation, proliferative melanoma cells can switch to an invasive slow-cycling state. Cells in this state are more aggressive and metastatic, and show increased intrinsic drug resistance. During continuous treatment, slow-cycling cells are enriched within the tumor and give rise to a new proliferative subpopulation with increased drug resistance, by exerting their stem cell-like behavior and phenotypic plasticity. In melanoma, the proliferative and invasive states are defined by high and low microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression, respectively. It has been observed that in MITF-high melanomas, inhibition of MITF increases the efficacy of targeted therapies and delays the acquisition of drug resistance. Contrarily, MITF is downregulated in melanomas with acquired drug resistance. According to the phenotype switching theory, the gene expression profile of the MITF-low state is predominantly regulated by WNT5A, AXL, and NF-kappa B signaling. Thus, different combinations of therapies should be effective in treating different phases of melanoma, such as the combination of targeted therapies with inhibitors of MITF expression during the initial treatment phase, but with inhibitors of WNT5A/AXL/NF-kappa B signaling during relapse.","Ahmed, F; Haass, Nk",10.3389/fonc.2018.00173,Frontiers In Oncology
Identifying Macroplastic Pathobiomes And Antibiotic Resistance In A Subtropical Fish Farm,"Macroplastics are ubiquitous in aquaculture ecosystems. However, to date the potential role of plastics as a support for bacterial biofilm that can include potential human pathogenic bacteria (PHPB) and antibioticresistant bacteria (ARB) has been largely overlooked. In this study, we used a combination of metabarcoding and standard antibiotic susceptibility testing to study the pathobiome and resistome of macroplastics, fish guts and the environment in a marine aquaculture farm in Mauritius. Aquaculture macroplastics were found to be higher in PHPB, dominated by the Vibrionaceae family (0.34 % of the total community), compared with environmental samples. Moreover, isolates from aquaculture plastics showed higher significant multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) compared to non-plastic samples of seawater, sediment and fish guts. These results suggest that plastics act as a reservoir and fomite of PHPB and ARB in aquaculture, potentially threatening the health of farmed fish and human consumers.","Naudet, J; D'Orbcastel, Er; Bouvier, T; Godreuil, S; Dyall, S; Bouvy, S; Rieuvilleneuve, F; Restrepo-Ortiz, Cx; Bettarel, Y; Auguet, Jc",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115267,Marine Pollution Bulletin
The Role Of Rna Modification In The Generation Of Acquired Drug Resistance In Glioma,"Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous system. The clinical treatment strategy is mainly surgery combined with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy, but patients can develop drug resistance during treatment, which severely limits its therapeutic efficacy. Epigenetic regulation at the RNA level is plastic and adaptable, and it can induce a variety of tumor responses to drugs. The regulators of RNA modification include methyltransferases, demethylases, and methylation binding proteins; these are also considered to play an important role in the development, prognosis, and therapeutic response of gliomas, which provides a basis for finding new targets of epigenetic drugs and resetting the sensitivity of tumor cells to temozolomide. This review discusses the relationship between the development of adaptive drug resistance and RNA modification in glioma and summarizes the progress of several major RNA modification strategies in this field, especially RNA m6A modification, m5C modification, and adenosine-to-inosine editing.","Yan, Y; Wei, W; Long, Sr; Ye, Sd; Yang, B; Jiang, Jz; Li, X; Chen, Jc",10.3389/fgene.2022.1032286,Frontiers In Genetics
Loggerhead Sea Turtles As Sentinels In The Western Mediterranean: Antibiotic Resistance And Environment-Related Modifications Of Gram-Negative Bacteria,"Sea turtles possess relevant characteristics to serve as sentinel species for monitoring the health of marine ecosystems, which is currently threatened. This study examined 35 loggerhead turtles from the western Mediterranean, focusing on the oral and cloacal prevalence of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, their antibiotic resistance and the influence of several variables linked both to the animal and the environment (i.e. estimated life stage; area, season and cause of recovery; plastic ingestion). Conventional bacteriology methods led to the isolation of bacterial families commonly regarded as opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Aeromonadaceae; Enterobacteriaceae; Pseudomonadaceae; Shewanellaceae; Vibrionaceae), but pointing out sea turtles as carriers of potential zoonotic agents. The high rates of antibiotic resistance, here detected, raise important concerns on the dissemination of this phenomenon in marine environments. Moreover, several of the examined variables showed a significant influence on the prevalence of bacterial families, strengthening the role of sea turtles as mirrors of their ecosystems.","Pace, A; Dipineto, L; Fioretti, A; Hochscheid, S",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110575,Marine Pollution Bulletin
A High-Throughput Screening Model Of The Tumor Microenvironment For Ovarian Cancer Cell Growth,"The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the processes of tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. We have used a multilayered 3D primary cell culture model that reproduces the human ovarian cancer metastatic microenvironment to study the effect of the microenvironment on the pharmacological responses of different classes of drugs on cancer cell proliferation. A collection of oncology drugs was screened to identify compounds that inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells growing as monolayers or forming spheroids, on plastic and on a 3D microenvironment culture model of the omentum metastatic site, and also cells already in preformed spheroids. Target-based analysis of the pharmacological responses revealed that several classes of targets were more efficacious in cancer cells growing in the absence of the metastatic microenvironment, and other target classes were less efficacious in cancer cells in preformed spheres compared to forming spheroid cultures. These findings show that both the cellular context of the tumor microenvironment and cell adhesion mode have an essential role in cancer cell drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to perform screens for new drugs using model systems that more faithfully recapitulate the tissue composition at the site of tumor growth and metastasis.","Lal-Nag, M; Mcgee, L; Guha, R; Lengyel, E; Kenny, Ha; Ferrer, M",10.1177/2472555216687082,Slas Discovery
Drug Resistance And Evolvability In An Emerging Human Fungal Pathogen,"Over the past decade, Candida auris has emerged as a highly transmissible human fungal pathogen. Because of its ability to transmit between patients in hospitals and its ability to rapidly develop drug resistance, C. auris presents unique challenges. However, at a genetic and genomic level we still understand relatively little about how drug resistance develops in this pathogen. Burrack et al. use experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations correlated with fluconazole resistance in C. auris. They identify interesting genomic features, including highly plastic subtelomeric regions and whole chromosomal and segmental aneuploidies. Excitingly, they also identify the first example of a hypermutator strain in C. auris. In comparison with the model human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, C. auris is more likely to undergo mutation and less likely to undergo copy number variation in response to drug selection, which may be linked to differences in base ploidy level.","Billmyre, Rb",10.1128/mbio.01876-22,Mbio
Platinum Sensitivity Of Ovarian Cancer Cells Does Not Influence Their Ability To Induce M2-Type Macrophage Polarization,"ProblemDevelopment of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer is mediated by both cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition program in cancer cells may lead to enrichment for resistant clones. These processes can be affected by tumor-associated macrophages, a highly plastic population of cells that participate in tumor progression and response to treatment by shaping the microenvironment. We aimed to study how platinum resistance influences the crosstalk between macrophages and ovarian cancer cells. Method of studyUsing cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line A2780, we developed and characterized cisplatin-resistant A2780Cis and cisplatin and doxorubicin co-resistant A2780Dox cell lines. Next, we set up an indirect coculture system with THP-1 cell line-derived M0-type-, M1-type- and M2-type-like polarized macrophages. We monitored the expression of genes associated with cellular stemness, multidrug resistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, and expression profile of M1/M2 markers in macrophages. ResultsDevelopment of drug resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines was accompanied by increased migration, clonogenicity, and upregulated expression of transcription factors, associated with cellular stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Upon coculture, we noted that the most relevant changes in gene expression profile occurred in A2780 cells. Moreover, M0- and M1-type macrophages, but not M2-type macrophages, showed significant transcriptional alterations. ConclusionOur results provide the evidence for bidirectional interplay between cancer cells and macrophages. Independent of platinum resistance status, ovarian cancer cells polarize macrophages toward M2-like type, whereas macrophages induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness-related gene expression profile in cisplatin-sensitive, but not cisplatin-resistant cancer cells.","Mlynska, A; Povilaityte, E; Zemleckaite, I; Zilionyte, K; Strioga, M; Krasko, J; Dobrovolskiene, N; Peng, Mw; Intaite, B; Pasukoniene, V",10.1111/aji.12996,American Journal Of Reproductive Immunology
Isolation And Characterization Of Human Pathogenic Multidrug Resistant Bacteria Associated With Plastic Litter Collected In Zanzibar,"Plastic pollution is a growing problem, not at least in areas where poor waste management results in direct pollution of coastal zones, such as South Asia and regions in Africa. In addition to the effect on ecosystems and their related services, plastic pollution may also affect human health indirectly as vectors for infectious disease. As plastic offers a suitable surface for the attachment of biofilm forming bacteria, it may contribute to disease outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance. To investigate the role of plastic litter as potential vectors for pathogenic bacteria, we collected plastic litter from four rural sites in Zanzibar, and isolated adhered bacteria. Isolates were short-read sequenced for further molecular analysis. This revealed that collected plastic litter was associated with diverse bacterial species, including human pathogens Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, most isolates were found to be multidrug resistant. Our findings confirm that plastic litter, serve as novel reservoir for human multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria that combined with poor sanitation and waste handling, may lead to transmission of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. These findings add a new level to the environmental challenges with plastic pollution; the potential health risk associated with exposure to plastic litter.","Rasool, Fn; Saavedra, Ma; Pamba, S; Perold, V; Mmochi, Aj; Maalim, M; Simonsen, L; Buur, L; Pedersen, Rh; Syberg, K; Jelsbak, L",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124591,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics In Urban Waters And Its Effects On Microbial Communities: A Critical Review,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is one of the emerging threats to the water and terrestrial environment, forcing a new environmental challenge due to the growing trend of plastic released into the environment. Synthetic and non-synthetic plastic components can be found in rivers, lakes/reservoirs, oceans, mountains, and even remote areas, such as the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. MPs' main challenge is identifying, measuring, and evaluating their impacts on environmental behaviors, such as carbon and nutrient cycles, water and wastewater microbiome, and the associated side effects. However, until now, no standardized methodical protocols have been proposed for comparing the results of studies in different environments, especially in urban water and wastewater. This review briefly discusses MPs' sources, fate, and transport in urban waters and explains methodological uncertainty. The effects of MPs on urban water microbiomes, including urban runoff, sewage wastewater, stagnant water in plumbing networks, etc., are also examined in depth. Furthermore, this study highlights the pathway of MPs and their transport vectors to different parts of ecosystems and human life, particularly through mediating microbial communities, antibiotic-resistant genes, and biogeochemical cycles. Overall, we have briefly highlighted the present research gaps, the lack of appropriate policy for evaluating microplastics and their interactions with urban water microbiomes, and possible future initiatives.","Entezari, S; Al, Ma; Mostashari, A; Ganjidoust, H; Ayati, B; Yang, J",10.1007/s11356-022-23810-2,Environmental Science And Pollution Research

Gauze Impregnated With Quaternary Ammonium Salt Reduces Bacterial Colonization Of Surgical Drains After Breast Reconstruction,"Surgical site infection after breast reconstruction is associated with increased length of hospital stay, readmission rates, cost, morbidity, and mortality. Identifyingmethods to reduce surgical site infectionwithout the use of antibiotics may be beneficial at reducing antimicrobial resistance, reserving the use of antibiotics for more severe cases. Quaternary ammonium salts have previously been shown to be a safe and effective antimicrobial agent in the setting of in vitro and in vivo animal experiments. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial properties of a quaternary ammonium salt, 3-trimethoxysilyl propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (QAS-3PAC; Bio-spear), at reducing surgical drain site colonization and infection after breast reconstruction (deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstruction or tissue expander placement). Twenty patients were enrolled, with 14 surgical drains covered with nonimpregnated gauze and 17 surgical drains covered with QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze, for the purposes of investigating bacterial colonization. Antibiotic sensitivity analysis was also conducted when bacterial cultures were positive. The overall incidence of bacterial colonization of surgical drains was lower in the treatment group compared with the control group (17.6% vs 64.3%, respectively; P = 0.008). QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze reduced the incidence of bacterial colonization of surgical drains during the first (0.0% vs 33.3%) and second (33.3% vs 87.5%; P = 0.04) postoperative week. Furthermore, no enhanced antibiotic resistance was noted on drains treated with QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze. The results of this study suggest that QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze applied over surgical drains may be an effective method for reducing the incidence of bacterial colonization.","Strong, Al; Wolfe, Et; Shank, N; Chaffin, Ae; Jansen, Da",10.1097/SAP.0000000000001420,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
High-Resolution Nmr Studies Of Antibiotics In Cellular Membranes,"The alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance requires antibiotics with unexploited mechanisms. Ideal templates could be antibiotics that target the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II, known as the bacterial Achilles heel, at an irreplaceable pyrophosphate group. Such antibiotics would kill multidrug-resistant pathogens at nanomolecular concentrations without causing antimicrobial resistance. However, due to the challenge of studying small membraneembedded drug-receptor complexes in native conditions, the structural correlates of the pharmaceutically relevant binding modes are unknown. Here, using advanced highly sensitive solid-state NMR setups, we present a high-resolution approach to study lipid II-binding antibiotics directly in cell membranes. On the example of nisin, the preeminent lantibiotic, we show that the native antibiotic-binding mode strongly differs from previously published structures, and we demonstrate that functional hotspots correspond to plastic drug domains that are critical for the cellular adaptability of nisin. Thereby, our approach provides a foundation for an improved understanding of powerful antibiotics.","Medeiros-Silva, J; Jekhmane, S; Paioni, Al; Gawarecka, K; Baldus, M; Swiezewska, E; Breukink, E; Weingarth, M",10.1038/s41467-018-06314-x,Nature Communications
Modelling Bistable Tumour Population Dynamics To Design Effective Treatment Strategies,"Despite recent advances in targeted drugs and immunotherapy, cancer remains the emperor of all maladies due to almost inevitable emergence of resistance. Drug resistance is thought to be driven by genetic alterations and/or dynamic plasticity that deregulate pathway activities and regulatory programs of a highly heterogeneous tumour. In this study, we propose a modelling framework to simulate population dynamics of heterogeneous tumour cells with reversible drug resistance. Drug sensitivity of a tumour cell is determined by its internal states, which are demarcated by coordinated activities of multiple interconnected oncogenic pathways. Transitions between cellular states depend on the effects of targeted drugs and regulatory relations between the pathways. Under this framework, we build a simple model to capture drug resistance characteristics of BRAF-mutant melanoma, where two cell states are determined by two mutually inhibitory - main and alternative - pathways. We assume that cells with an activated main pathway are proliferative yet sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor, and cells with an activated alternative pathway are quiescent but resistant to the drug. We describe a dynamical process of tumour growth under various drug regimens using the explicit solutions of mean-field equations. Based on these solutions, we compare efficacy of three treatment strategies from simulated data: static treatments with continuous and constant dosages, periodic treatments with regular intermittent active phases and drug holidays, and treatments derived from optimal control theory (OCT). Periodic treatments outperform static treatments with a considerable margin, while treatments based on OCT outperform the best periodic treatment. Our results provide insights regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for heterogeneous tumours, and may guide the development of optimal therapeutic strategies to circumvent plastic drug resistance. They can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of suboptimal treatments that may account for side effects of the treatment and the cost of its application. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Analysis Of Pathogen Distribution And Antimicrobial Resistance At Infected Sites In Plastic Surgery,"ObjectiveBy analyzing the distribution and drug resistance of common pathogen in different sites in plastic surgery to provide reference for clinicians to choose the best antibacterial treatment plan. MethodsPathogens of postoperative infection in plastic surgery from January 2011 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed to determine the species and quantity, and to access the trend of each pathogen's detection rate. The antibiotic sensitivity and distribution characteristics of common pathogens were studied in conjunction with the site of infection. ResultsA total of 1709 bacterial strains were detected, including 1244 gram-positive bacterial strains and 465 gram-negative bacterial strains. The main pathogen of perineum was Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the most common pathogen in the other infected sites. The detection rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (MRCNS) was on the rise from 2011 to 2021. No S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) strains were resistant to vancomycin. The sensitive rate of S. aureus from all parts and CoNS from all sites except lower limbs and mandible was higher than 80% to linezolid. The resistance rate of S. aureus and CoNS in all parts to penicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin was high. The susceptibility rate of CoNS in lower mandible was high to gentamicin. ConclusionsStaphylococcus aureus was the primary pathogen of gram-positive bacteria in all site of plastic surgery except perineum, followed by CoNS. The distribution and drug resistance of pathogen in different infection sites were different. We should formulate more accurate and reasonable antibacterial programs according to drug resistance results of various parts to reduce the emergence of resistant strains and effectively prevent and control infection.","Jiang, Fl; Su, Xs; Dai, Yd; Shen, H; Hu, Jt; Wu, Ls; Wu, Yy; Zhan, S",10.1111/jocd.15600,Journal Of Cosmetic Dermatology
Antimicrobial Resistance In Bacterial Pathogens Among Hospitalised Patients With Severe Invasive Infections,"The most severe infections are invasive infections, due to the fact that the germs can accumulate in multiple sites and produce a body-wide infection known as sepsis. Septic shock has the highest mortality rate among non-traumatic medical conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of invasive infections in a hospital environment. Another second objective was to establish the aetiology of invasive infections in our hospital and the antibiotic resistance profile of the germs involved, which are both important for determining the therapeutic approach for the treatment of these infections. The study included 505 hospitalized patients from which we collected a total of 974 blood cultures. For the analysis of the blood cultures, we used an automated incubator. The bottles flagged as positive were subcultured on blood agar, and the grown colonies were identified using an identification system. Invasive infections had a prevalence rate of 27.72% in our hospital. From the 974 blood cultures, we isolated 170 bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 63 strains, 37.06%), Klebsiella spp. (27 strains, 15.88%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 18 strains, 10.59%), Enterococcus spp. (17 strains, 10.00%), Escherichia coli (12 strains, 7.06%), Streptococcus spp. (11 strains, 6.47%) and other bacterial species. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) in our study was 36.51% from the SA strains. The MRSA prevalence differed significantly according to age (37.50% in adults vs. 28.57% in children, P=0.047) and ICU admission (42.42% in ICU patients vs. 30.00% in non-ICU patients, P=0.018). We performed a multivariate analysis of the invasive infection risk which detected as significant predictors the admission into the cardiology ward and plastic surgery ward. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that the high prevalence of Gram-positive cocci in blood cultures, mostly SA, with multidrug resistance has important consequences for the management of invasive infections.","Zlatian, O; Balasoiu, At; Balasoiu, M; Cristea, O; Docea, Ao; Mitrut, R; Spandidos, Da; Tsatsakis, Am; Bancescu, G; Calina, D",10.3892/etm.2018.6737,Experimental And Therapeutic Medicine
Whole Community And Functional Gene Changes Of Biofilms On Marine Plastic Debris In Response To Ocean Acidification,"Plastics are accumulating in the world's oceans, while ocean waters are becoming acidified by increased CO2. We compared metagenome of biofilms on tethered plastic bottles in subtidal waters off Japan naturally enriched in CO2, compared to normal ambient CO2 levels. Extending from an earlier amplicon study of bacteria, we used metagenomics to provide direct insights into changes in the full range of functional genes and the entire taxonomic tree of life in the context of the changing plastisphere. We found changes in the taxonomic community composition of all branches of life. This included a large increase in diatom relative abundance across the treatments but a decrease in diatom diversity. Network complexity among families decreased with acidification, showing overall simplification of biofilm integration. With acidification, there was decreased prevalence of genes associated with cell-cell interactions and antibiotic resistance, decreased detoxification genes, and increased stress tolerance genes. There were few nutrient cycling gene changes, suggesting that the role of plastisphere biofilms in nutrient processes within an acidified ocean may not change greatly. Our results suggest that as ocean CO2 increases, the plastisphere will undergo broad-ranging changes in both functional and taxonomic composition, especially the ecologically important diatom group, with possible wider implications for ocean ecology.","Kerfahi, D; Harvey, B; Kim, H; Yang, Y; Adams, Jm; Hall-Spencer, Jm",10.1007/s00248-022-01987-w,Microbial Ecology
Rapid Bacterial Motility Monitoring Using Inexpensive 3D-Printed Openflexure Microscopy Allows Microfluidic Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing,"Antibiotic susceptibility testing is vital to tackle the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Inexpensive digital CMOS cameras can be converted into portable digital microscopes using 3D printed x-y-z stages. Microscopic examination of bacterial motility can rapidly detect the response of microbes to antibiotics to determine susceptibility. Here, we present a new simple microdevice-miniature microscope cell measurement system for multiplexed antibiotic susceptibility testing. The microdevice is made using melt-extruded plastic film strips containing ten parallel 0.2 mm diameter microcapillaries. Two different antibiotics, ceftazidime and gentamicin, were prepared in Mueller-Hinton agar (0.4%) to produce an antibiotic-loaded microdevice for simple sample addition. This combination was selected to closely match current standard methods for both antibiotic susceptibility testing and motility testing. Use of low agar concentration permits observation of motile bacteria responding to antibiotic exposure as they enter capillaries. This device fits onto the OpenFlexure 3D-printed digital microscope using a Raspberry Pi computer and v2 camera, avoiding need for expensive laboratory microscopes. This inexpensive and portable digital microscope platform had sufficient magnification to detect motile bacteria, yet wide enough field of view to monitor bacteria behavior as they entered antibiotic-loaded microcapillaries. The image quality was sufficient to detect how bacterial motility was inhibited by different concentrations of antibiotic. We conclude that a 3D-printed Raspberry Pi-based microscope combined with disposable microfluidic test strips permit rapid, easy-to-use bacterial motility detection, with potential for aiding detection of antibiotic resistance.","Diep, Tt; Needs, Sh; Bizley, S; Edwards, Ad",10.3390/mi13111974,Micromachines
"Taxonomic Variation, Plastic Degradation, And Antibiotic Resistance Traits Of Plastisphere Communities In The Maturation Pond Of A Wastewater Treatment Plant","Wastewater treatment facilities can filter out some plastics before they reach the open environment, yet microplastics often persist throughout these systems. As they age, microplastics in wastewater may both leach and sorb pollutants and fragment to provide an increased surface area for bacterial attachment and conjugation, possibly impacting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) traits. Despite this, little is known about the effects of persistent plastic pollution on microbial functioning. To address this knowledge gap, we deployed five different artificially weathered plastic types and a glass control into the final maturation pond of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in & Omacr;tautahi-Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand. We sampled the plastic-associated biofilms (plastisphere) at 2, 6, 26, and 52 weeks, along with the ambient pond water, at three different depths (20, 40, and 60 cm from the pond water surface). We investigated the changes in plastisphere microbial diversity and functional potential through metagenomic sequencing. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes composition did not vary among plastic types and glass controls (P = 0.997) but varied among sampling times [permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), P = 0.001] and depths (PERMANOVA, P = 0.011). Overall, there was no polymer-substrate specificity evident in the total composition of genes (PERMANOVA, P = 0.67), but sampling time (PERMANOVA, P = 0.002) and depth were significant factors (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001). The plastisphere housed diverse AMR gene families, potentially influenced by biofilm-meditated conjugation. The plastisphere also harbored an increased abundance of genes associated with the biodegradation of nylon, or nylon-associated substances, including nylon oligomer-degrading enzymes and hydrolases.IMPORTANCEPlastic pollution is pervasive and ubiquitous. Occurrences of plastics causing entanglement or ingestion, the leaching of toxic additives and persistent organic pollutants from environmental plastics, and their consequences for marine macrofauna are widely reported. However, little is known about the effects of persistent plastic pollution on microbial functioning. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing provides us with the necessary tools to examine broad-scale community functioning to further investigate how plastics influence microbial communities. This study provides insight into the functional consequence of continued exposure to waste plastic by comparing the prokaryotic functional potential of biofilms on five types of plastic [linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), nylon-6, polyethylene terephthalate, polylactic acid, and oxygen-degradable LLDPE], glass, and ambient pond water over 12 months and at different depths (20, 40, and 60 cm) within a tertiary maturation pond of a municipal wastewater treatment plant.

"Spatial Turnover Of Core And Occasional Bacterial Taxa In The Plastisphere From A Plateau River, China","Plastic surfaces surfaces in the environment are a comparatively new niche for microbial colonization, also known as the plastisphere. However, our understanding of the core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere is limited. Here, environmental plastic, water, and sediment samples were collected from 10 sites in a plateau river (Lhasa River, China) in September of 2019. The composition and spatial turnover of core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere were revealed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared with water and sediment. The results indicated that deterministic processes dominated the habitat specialization that shaped the formation of core and occasional taxa in the plastisphere, water, and sediment of the Lhasa River because the decline in zeta diversity in the plastisphere, water, and sediment was more fitted to a power-law form rather than an exponential form. Proteobacteria (65.9%), Bacteroidetes (16.0%), and Cyanobacreria (11.7%) dominated the plastic core taxa. Core taxa rather than occasional taxa in the plastisphere had a lower (21.7%) proportion of OTUs and a higher (81.7%) proportion of average relative abundance than water and sediment, which were dominant in plastic bacterial communities. The spatial turnover of core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere was governed by abiotic as well as biotic factors. Specifically, the spatial turnover of core taxa in the plastispherc with high connectivity but low functional redundancy was easily affected by geographical distance, altitude, and heavy metals. Furthermore, strong drug resistance was found in the spatially persistent core taxa in the plastisphere. This study provides empirical support for the spatial turnover (species variation) and potential ecological mechanisms of bacterial communities in the plastisphere from river ecosystems.","Zhang, Wh; Jiang, Cx; Chen, L; Bhagwat, G; Thava, P; Yang, Yy",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156179,Science Of The Total Environment
Cutaneous Serratia Marcescens Infections In Korea: A Retrospective Analysis Of 13 Patients,"Serratia marcescens is a Gram-negative bacillus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Because of increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance, this bacterium has received considerable attention and has emerged as an important pathogen. In order to reveal clinical and microbiological characteristics of S.marcescens cutaneous infection and to suggest appropriate antibiotic treatment, we retrospectively analyzed 17 strains isolated from wound swabs of Korean patients between November 2005 and March 2014. A total of 13 patients (five men and eight women) were included in our study, with a mean age of 46.3years (range, 21-82). Based on medical history, seven patients were classified as immunocompromised. Prior predisposing factors for infections were noted in 12 patients, including pre-existing leg ulcers or dermatitis (5/13), preceding cancer surgeries (2/13), plastic surgeries and filler injection (2/13), traumas (2/13) and medical procedures following cutaneous abscess (1/13). Cutaneous infections showed various clinical presentations, including spontaneous dermal abscess, fingernail change, painful nodules and papular erosions. We found that third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, levofloxacin and meropenem appeared active against all 17 strains invitro. Clinically, all patients treated with empirical first-generation cephalosporin showed treatment resistance, and oral quinolone monotherapy was the most preferred antibiotic regimen without treatment failure, with an average treatment duration of 25days (range, 14-42). This study demonstrates the various clinical presentations and treatment responses for cutaneous S.marcescens infection. Moreover, we suggest that initial antibiotic coverage should be broad enough to account for multidrug resistance in this rare pathogen.","Seo, J; Shin, D; Oh, Sh; Lee, Jh; Chung, Ky; Lee, Mg; Kim, Ds",10.1111/1346-8138.13059,Journal Of Dermatology
Fluvial Flooding And Plastic Pollution - The Delivery Of Potential Human Pathogenic Bacteria Into Agricultural Fields,"The frequency of plastic debris entering agricultural land is likely going to increase due to increased discharge into surface waters and more frequent flood events. Microbial biofilm on the surfaces of plastic pollution (known as the 'plastisphere') in freshwater environments often includes human pathogenic bacteria capable of causing disease. Pathogens have been detected on the surface of plastics in freshwater environments, but it is yet to be determined whether plastic debris can also transport pathogens into agricultural fields during flooding. Therefore, this study quantified the presence of viable pathogenic bacteria on the surface of plastic pollution at five agricultural fields along two rivers. All visible plastic debris, including sewage-associated plastic waste, were collected along a perpendicular 100 m transect from the riparian zone into each field. All plastic pieces were screened for five target bacteria (Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp.) using selective media, and positively identified colonies subsequently tested for antimicrobial resistance. In all five fields, there were higher volumes of plastic in the areas closer to the river, with 75% +/- 24% of plastic collected within 30 m from the riverbank. Overall, 49% of all plastic collected in agricultural fields was colonised by phenotypically positive colonies for at least one or more target bacteria, with resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics detected among several of these target bacteria. Therefore, the transport of contaminated plastic debris from fluvial floodwater into agricultural fields could pose an as yet unquantified risk of introducing potentially harmful bacteria into agricultural systems and the ultimately into the food chain.","Pow, Cj; Fellows, R; White, Hl; Woodford, L; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125518,Environmental Pollution
Plastic Transcriptomes Stabilize Immunity To Pathogen Diversity: The Jasmonic Acid And Salicylic Acid Networks Within The Arabidopsis/Botrytis Pathosystem,"To respond to pathogen attack, selection and associated evolution has led to the creation of plant immune system that are a highly effective and inducible defense system. Central to this system are the plant defense hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) and crosstalk between the two, which may play an important role in defense responses to specific pathogens or even genotypes. Here, we used the Arabidopsis thaliana-Botrytis cinerea pathosystem to test how the host's defense system functions against genetic variation in a pathogen. We measured defense-related phenotypes and transcriptomic responses in Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 and JA-and SA-signaling mutants, coi1-1 and npr1-1, individually challenged with 96 diverse B. cinerea isolates. Those data showed genetic variation in the pathogen influences on all components within the plant defense system at the transcriptional level. We identified four gene coexpression networks and two vectors of defense variation triggered by genetic variation in B. cinerea. This showed that the JA and SA signaling pathways functioned to constrain/canalize the range of virulence in the pathogen population, but the underlying transcriptomic response was highly plastic. These data showed that plants utilize major defense hormone pathways to buffer disease resistance, but not the metabolic or transcriptional responses to genetic variation within a pathogen.","Zhang, W; Corwin, Ja; Copeland, D; Feusier, J; Eshbaugh, R; Chen, F; Atwell, S; Kliebenstein, Dj",10.1105/tpc.17.00348,Plant Cell
Enhanced Bacterial Adhesion Force By Rifampicin Resistance Promotes Microbial Colonization On Pe Plastic Compared To Non-Resistant Biofilm Formation,"The microbial biofilm formed on plastics, is ubiquitous in the environment. However, the effects of antibiotic resistance on the development of the biofilm on plastics, especially with regard to initial cell attachment, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the initial bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth of a rifampin (Rif) resistant E. coli (RRE) and a normal gram-positive B. subtilis on a typical plastic (polyethylene, PE). The experiments were conducted in different antibiotic solutions, including Rif, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and kanamycin (KM), with concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 & mu;g/L to simulate different aquatic environments. The AFM-based single-cell adhesion force determination revealed that Rif resistance strengthened the adhesion force of RRE to PE in the environment rich in Rif rather than SMX and KM. The enhanced adhesion force may be due to the higher secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), particularly proteins, by RRE in the presence of Rif compared to the other two antibiotics. In addition, the higher ATP level of RRE would facilitate the initial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth. Transcriptome analysis of RRE separately cultured in Rif and SMX environments demonstrated a clear correlation between the expression of Rif resistance and the augmented bacterial adhesion and cellular activity. Biofilm biomass analysis confirmed the promotion effect of Rif resistance on biofilm growth when compared to non-resistant biofilms, establishing a novel association with the augmentation of microbial adhesion force. Our study highlights concerns related to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance during microbial colonization on plastic that may arise from antibiotic resistance.","Wu, Jy; Liu, Cc; Wang, R; Yan, St; Chen, Bl; Zhu, Xy",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120319,Water Research
Dynamic Phenotypic Transition Of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro Revealed By Self-Floating Cell Culture,"Background: Breast tumor heterogeneity leads to phenotypic diversity, such as tumor-initiating and metastatic properties and drug sensitivity. Materials and Methods: We found that a self-floating cell (SFC) culture enriches a drug-resistant subpopulation in a HER2-positive breast cancer cell line. SFCs were analyzed for cancer stem cell markers, gene expression profiles, and sensitivity for anticancer drugs. Results: SFCs expressed cancer stem cell markers, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and elevated HER2 autophosphorylation. Gene expression profiles of SFCs showed a dramatic difference compared to those of parental or forced floating cells. SFCs also expressed CD133, a marker of drug resistance, and resisted cytotoxic drugs by drug efflux transporters. In contrast, HER2 kinase inhibitors efficiently reduced SFC viability. Conclusion: SFCs enrich drug-resistant subpopulations even in vitro and might reflect the highly plastic nature of breast cancer cells even in vitro.","Oku, Y; Nishiya, N; Tsuda, K; Shibazaki, M; Maesawa, C; Uehara, Y",10.21873/anticanres.11513,Anticancer Research

"Microbiology Of Facial Skin Infections-Strains, Susceptibility, And Therapeutic Consequences","Background: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common conditions with severe and potentially life-threatening outcomes. However, the use of antibiotics to treat these infections is controversial. Purpose: This study was to identify the microorganisms responsible for facial SSTIs, their antibiotic sen-sitivities, and the therapeutic outcomes of treatment.Study design, setting, and sample: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study conducted at a single oral and maxillofacial plastic surgery department. The study sample included 103 patients with facial SSTIs (61 men, 42 women) with a mean age of 41.8 years (standard deviation +/- 20.4). Predictor/exposure/independent variables: The predictor variables included patient characteris-tics, antibiotic use before the clinic visit, and the infection's site and origin. Main outcome variable(s): The primary outcome variable was the presence of antibiotic resistance in the bacterial strains isolated from the infections. Methods: The data were collected by reviewing the results of microbiological swabs and patient records obtained from patients with facial SSTIs. Categorical variables were described using absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation. The association between antibiotic resistance and the predictor variables was analyzed using Pearson's c2 test and stu-dent's t test. Results: The most common cause of SSTI was an infected epidermal cyst (60.1%). Of all the microorgan-isms identified, 80.6% were Gram-positive, and 55.8% showed antibiotic resistance against one or more of the evaluated antibiotics, including several backup antibiotics. There were no identified risk factors that significantly influenced the probability of resistance, and there were no adverse events observed. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that surgery should be the primary approach for treating SSTIs, as antibiotic administration may not be effective due to the unknown susceptibility of the causative strains. Antibiotics should be reserved for severe cases and high-risk patients, and if deemed necessary for SSTI management, a broad-spectrum antibiotic should be administered to cover resistant organisms.

Stable Isotopes And Nanosims Single-Cell Imaging Reveals Soil Plastisphere Colonizers Able To Assimilate Sulfamethoxazole,"The presence and accumulation of both, plastics and antibiotics in soils may lead to the colonization, selection, and propagation of soil bacteria with certain metabolic traits, e.g., antibiotic resistance, in the plastisphere. However, the impact of plastic-antibiotic tandem on the soil ecosystem functioning, particularly on microbial function and metabolism remains currently unexplored. Herein, we investigated the competence of soil bacteria to colonize plastics and degrade C-13-labeled sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Using single-cell imaging, isotope tracers, soil respiration and SMX mineralization bulk measurements we show that microbial colonization of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces takes place within the first 30 days of incubation. Morphologically diverse microorganisms were colonizing both plastic types, with a slight preference for PE substrate. CARD-FISH bacterial cell counts on PE and PS surfaces formed under SMX amendment ranged from 5.36 x 10(3) to 2.06 x 10(4), and 2.06 x 10(3) to 3.43 x 10(3) hybridized cells mm(-2), respectively. Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry measurements show that C-13 enrichment was highest at 130 days with values up to 1.29 atom%, similar to those of the (CO2)-C-13 pool (up to 1.26 atom%, or 22.55 parts per thousand). Independent Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between the control plastisphere samples incubated without SMX and those in C-13-SMX incubations (P < 0.001). Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating, at single-cell level, the capacity of bacterial colonizers of plastics to assimilate C-13-SMX from contaminated soils.

Here, we demonstrate that nano-sized polystyrene modified with carboxyl groups (nPS) and background magnetite (nFe3O4) nanoparticles at environmentally relevant concentrations can collectively stimulate biofilm formation and prompt antibiotic resistance. Combined exposure of nPS and nFe3O4 by P. aeruginosa biofilm cells stimulated intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) production more significantly compared with individual exposure. The resultant upregulation of quorum sensing (QS) and c-di-GMP signaling pathways enhanced the biosynthesis of polysaccharides by 50 %- 66 % and increased biofilm biomass by 36 %- 40 % relative to unexposed control. Consistently, biofilm mechanical stability (measured as Young's modulus) increased by 7.2-9.1 folds, and chemical stress resistance (measured with chlorine disinfection) increased by 1.4-2.0 folds. For P. aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentration of different antibiotics also increased by 1.1-2.5 folds after combined exposure. Moreover, at a microbial community-wide level, metagenomic analysis revealed that the combined exposure enhanced the multi-species biofilm's resistance to chlorine, enriched the opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, and promoted their virulence and antibiotic resistance. Overall, the enhanced formation of biofilms (that may harbor opportunistic pathogens) by nanoplastics and background nanoparticles is an overlooked phenomenon, which may jeopardize the microbial safety of drinking water distribution systems.","Wang, Hb; Hu, Cs; Li, Yk; Shen, Y; Guo, Jh; Shi, By; Alvarez, Pjj; Yu, Pf",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134974,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antimicrobial Resistance And Biotechnological Potential Of Plastic-Associated Bacteria Isolated From An Urban Estuary,"Plastics have quickly become one of the major pollutants in aquatic environments worldwide and solving the plastic pollution crisis is considered a central goal of modern society. In this study, 10 different plastic samples, including high- and low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, were collected from a deeply polluted urban estuary in Brazil. By employing different isolation and analysis approaches to investigate plastic-associated bacteria, a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, and Vibrio was observed throughout all plastic samples. Bacteria typically found in the aquatic environment harboured clinically relevant genes encoding resistance to carbapenems (blaKPC) and colistin (such as mcr-3 and mcr-4), along with genetic determinants associated with potentially active gene mobilization. Whole genome sequencing and annotation of three plastic-associated Vibrio strains further demonstrated the carriage of mobile genetic elements and antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. On the other hand, bacteria isolated from the same samples were also able to produce esterases, lipases, and bioemulsifiers, thus highlighting that the plastisphere could also be of special interest from a biotechnological perspective. From a microbiological perspective, understanding the health risks posed by plastic-associated microorganisms and harnessing their biotechnological potential are two emerging fields of research. In this study, by using a culture-guided approach, pertinent information regarding public health and the functional characterization of the plastisphere was achieved.image","Canellas, Alb; Abdon, Bb; Diniz, Mn; Alves, Gdo; Lourenço, Mfd; Machado, Wtv; Giambiagi-Demarval, M; De Oliveira, Bfr; Laport, Ms",10.1111/1462-2920.16540,Environmental Microbiology
The Application Of Photodynamic Therapy In Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a modern clinical treatment paradigm with the advantages of high selectivity, non-invasiveness, rare side-effect, no obvious drug resistance and easy combination with other therapies. These features have endowed PDT with high focus and application prospects. Studies of photodynamic therapy have been expanded in a lot of biomedical and clinical fields, especially Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (PRS) the author major in. In this review, we emphasize the mechanism and advances in PDT related to the PRS applications including benign pigmented lesions, vascular malformations, inflammatory lesions, tumor and others. Besides, combined with clinical data analysis, the limitation of PDT and current issues that need to be addressed in the field of PRS have also been discussed. At last, a comprehensive discussion and outlooking represent future progress of PDT in PRS.","Wu, M; Huang, Xy; Gao, L; Zhou, Gy; Xie, F",10.3389/fchem.2022.967312,Frontiers In Chemistry
Well-Known And New Variants Of Pathogenic Escherichia Coli As A Consequence Of The Plastic Genome,"E. coli is a diverse bacterial species encompassing commensal as well as intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains. The ability to adapt to so many different niches in the host organism is determined by the extreme genomic plasticity of E. coli. The genetic diversity is due to a complex phylogenetic structure in which besides the well-known main groups A, B1, B2 and D, four new groups, C, E, F and Clad I, have been characterized recently. The mobile gene pool exchanged by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is another important driving force in the evolution of E. coli. Pathogenicity of strains is conditioned by a specific repertoire of virulence factors located on the mobile genetic elements and transmitted by HGT. The environment changing constantly stimulates the formation of new virulence gene combinations that generate the formation, not observed so far, of new pathogenic clones of higher capacity for virulence and greater expansiveness. The presence of very similar virulence plasmids carrying conserved combinations of the virulence genes (CVP) among extraintestinal pathogenic strains in humans and birds has been observed. It indicates a real possibility of occurrence of common virulence factors. The increase in drug resistance among pathogenic E. coli is also reflected in the prevalence of highly expansive clones exhibiting both high virulence and resistance. The presented data indicate that further studies are required to determine the interdependencies of resistance and virulence at the genetic level to help improve our management of the infectious diseases caused by these bacteria.","Baldy-Chudzik, K; Bok, E; Mazurek, J",10.5604/17322693.1145173,Postepy Higieny I Medycyny Doswiadczalnej
Single-Use Polyethylene Terephthalate Bottle-Derived Nanoplastics Propagate Antibiotic Resistance In Bacteria Via Transformation And Outer Membrane Vesicle Secretion,"Plastic pollution arising from single-use plastic bottles (SUPBs) and containers leads to the formation of micro/nanoplastics (NPs). These NPs raise concerns due to their potential toxicity and interactions with microorganisms. In various environments, including our digestive system, both microorganisms and plastics coexist. The interactions between these NPs and microorganisms can have far-reaching consequences, potentially affecting the ecosystems and human health. Therefore, understanding these interactions is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by plastic pollution. This study investigated the role of NPs in propagating antibiotic resistance (AR), specifically through outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which is a mechanism that has not been fully explored to date in terms of NPs' effects. To explore this, NPs were synthesized using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) SUPBs, mimicking the natural chemical composition of environmental nanoplastics, unlike previous studies, which used pure PET, polystyrene (PS) or other pure plastic materials. The resulting PET bottle-derived nanoplastics (PBNPs), which exhibited diverse shapes and sizes (50-850 nm), were found to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through transformation and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), enabling the transport of plasmids among bacteria. In transformation, PBNPs physically carried plasmids across the bacterial membrane. In another scenario, PBNPs induced oxidative stress and bacterial surface damage, which led to the upregulation of stress response-associated genes and the escalation of OMV secretion in E. coli. This novel pathway highlights how PBNPs contribute to AR gene dissemination, potentially exacerbating the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Furthermore, PBNPs mediate cross-species gene transfer from E. coli to Lactobacillus acidophilus, underscoring their impact on diverse microorganisms, including those in the human gut. Our findings suggest that nanoplastics may be an unrecognized contributor to the rising tide of antibiotic resistance, with significant consequences for human health and the environment. Molecular analyses revealed the upregulated expression of genes associated with stress response and OMV secretion, offering deeper insights into the biological mechanisms affected by PBNPs. This study offers crucial insights into the interactions of NPs and microorganisms for developing strategies to address the ecological and health implications of nanoplastic contamination.","Sharma, P; Kishore, A; Singh, M",10.1039/d4nr02613f,Nanoscale
"Environmental Pitfalls And Associated Human Health Risks And Ecological Impacts From Landfill Leachate Contaminants: Current Evidence, Recommended Interventions And Future Directions","The improper management of solid waste, particularly the dumping of untreated municipal solid waste, poses a growing global challenge in both developed and developing nations. The generation of leachate is one of the significant issues that arise from this practice, and it can have harmful impacts on both the environment and public health. This paper presents an overview of the primary waste types that generate landfill leachate and their characteristics. This includes examining the distribution of waste types in landfills globally and how they have changed over time, which can provide valuable insights into potential pollutants in a given area and their trends. With a lack of specific regulations and growing concerns regarding environmental and health impacts, the paper also focuses on emerging contaminants. Furthermore, the environmental and ecological impacts of leachate, along with associated health risks, are analyzed. The potential applications of landfill leachate, suggested interventions and future directions are also discussed in the manuscript. Finally, this work addresses future research directions in landfill leachate studies, with attention, for the first time to the potentialities that artificial intelligence can offer for landfill leachate management, studies, and applications.","Gunarathne, V; Phillips, Aj; Zanoletti, A; Rajapaksha, Au; Vithanage, M; Di Maria, F; Pivato, A; Korzeniewska, E; Bontempi, E",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169026,Science Of The Total Environment
Detection Of Eskape Bacterial Pathogens At The Point Of Care Using Isothermal Dna-Based Assays In A Portable Degas-Actuated Microfluidic Diagnostic Assay Platform,"An estimated 1.5 billion microbial infections occur globally each year and result in similar to 4.6 million deaths. A technology gap associated with commercially available diagnostic tests in remote and underdeveloped regions prevents timely pathogen identification for effective antibiotic chemotherapies for infected patients. The result is a trial-and-error approach that is limited in effectiveness, increases risk for patients while contributing to antimicrobial drug resistance, and reduces the lifetime of antibiotics. This paper addresses this important diagnostic technology gap by describing a low-cost, portable, rapid, and easy-to-use microfluidic cartridgebased system for detecting the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) bacterial pathogens that are most commonly associated with antibiotic resistance. The point-of-care molecular diagnostic system consists of a vacuumdegassed microfluidic cartridge preloaded with lyophilized recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays and a small portable battery-powered electronic incubator/reader. The isothermal RPA assays detect the targeted ESKAPE pathogens with high sensitivity (e.g., a limit of detection of similar to 10 nucleic acid molecules) that is comparable to that of current PCR-based assays, and they offer advantages in power consumption, engineering, and robustness, which are three critical elements required for the point-of-care setting. IMPORTANCE This paper describes a portable system for rapidly identifying bacteria in resource-limited environments; we highlight the capabilities of the technology by detecting different pathogens within the ESKAPE collection, which cause nosocomial infections. The system is designed around isothermal DNA-based assays housed within an autonomous plastic cartridge that are designed with the end user in mind, who may have limited technological training. Displaying excellent sensitivity and specificity, the assay systems that we demonstrate may enable future diagnoses of bacterial infection to guide the development of effective chemotherapies and may have a role in areas beyond health where rapid detection is valuable, including in industrial processing and manufacturing, food security, agriculture, and water quality testing.","Renner, Ld; Zan, Jd; Hu, Li; Martinez, M; Resto, Pj; Siegel, Ac; Torres, C; Hall, Sb; Slezak, Tr; Nguyen, Th; Weibel, Db",10.1128/AEM.02449-16,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Microbial Spectrum And Resistance Of Odontogenic Abscesses - Microbiological Analysis Using Next Generation Sequencing,"ObjectivesThis study aimed to map the microbiome of odontogenic abscesses using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify bacterial and fungal species, as well as antibiotic resistances.Materials and methodsWound swabs were taken from patients treated for odontogenic abscesses at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Bonn. NGS was used to analyze the swabs, and bioinformatic analysis assigned the genetic material to microorganism profiles and identified antibiotic resistances.ResultsBacteria were detected in all samples from 51 patients. Anaerobes were found in 50 swabs, while aerobic bacteria were detected in 30. Four of the five most common bacterial genera were anaerobes (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Porphyromonas). A median of eight genera were identified per swab. Infections were mostly polymicrobial; only one case was a monoinfection with Streptococcus. Aerobic bacteria were less frequent in patients who had prior antibiotic therapy (p = 0.015). Fungi were present in 52.9% of cases, with Malassezia (33.3%), Aspergillus (9.8%), and Candida (3.9%) being the most common. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 66.7% of patients, mainly against lincosamides, macrolides and tetracyclines. Fusobacterium showed a 25.9% resistance rate to clindamycin.ConclusionsThe microbiome of odontogenic abscesses is polymicrobial, dominated by anaerobic bacteria, and more extensive than indicated by traditional cultural diagnostics. NGS provides detailed pathogen diagnostics, aiding in precise and individualized antibiotic therapy.Clinical relevanceImproved understanding of the bacterial and fungal spectrum, along with current resistance patterns of odontogenic abscesses, is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. NGS offers rapid, accurate and detailed microbiome analysis, enhancing patient-specific therapeutic strategies.","Thol, F; Warwas, Fb; Spuck, N; Kramer, Fj; Heim, N",10.1007/s00784-024-06097-0,Clinical Oral Investigations
Microplastic Pollution Increases Gene Exchange In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Pollution by microplastics in aquatic ecosystems is accumulating at an unprecedented scale, emerging as a new surface for biofilm formation and gene exchange. In this study, we determined the permissiveness of aquatic bacteria towards a model antibiotic resistance plasmid, comparing communities that form biofilms on microplastics vs. those that are free-living. We used an exogenous and red-fluorescent E. coli donor strain to introduce the green-fluorescent broad-host-range plasmid pKJKS which encodes for trimethoprim resistance. We demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with microplastics compared to bacteria that are free-living or in natural aggregates. Moreover, comparison of communities grown on polycarbonate filters showed that increased gene exchange occurs in a broad range of phylogenetically-diverse bacteria. Our results indicate horizontal gene transfer in this habitat could distinctly affect the ecology of aquatic microbial communities on a global scale. The spread of antibiotic resistance through microplastics could also have profound consequences for the evolution of aquatic bacteria and poses a neglected hazard for human health.

Riverine Microplastic And Microbial Community Compositions: A Field Study In The Netherlands,"Plastic pollution in aquatic environments, particularly microplastics (<5 mm), is an emerging health threat. The buoyancy, hydrophobic hard surfaces, novel polymer carbon sources and long-distance transport make microplastics a unique substrate for biofilms, potentially harbouring pathogens and enabling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene exchange. Microplastic concentrations, their polymer types and the associated microbial communities were determined in paired, contemporaneous samples from the Dutch portion of the river Rhine. Microplastics were collected through a cascade of 500/100/10 mu m sieves; filtrates and surface water were also analysed. Microplastics were characterized with infrared spectroscopy. Microbial communities and selected virulence and AMR genes were determined with 16S rRNA-sequencing and qPCR. Average microplastic concentration was 213,147 particles/m(3); polyamide and polyvinylchloride were the most abundant polymers. Microbial composition on 10 0-500 mu m samples differed significantly from surface water and 10-100 mu m or smaller samples, with lower microbial diversity compared to surface water. An increasingly 'water-like' microbial community was observed as particles became smaller. Associations amongst specific microbial taxa, polymer types and particle sizes, as well as seasonal and methodological effects, were also observed. Known biofilm-forming and plastic-degrading taxa (e.g. Pseudomonas) and taxa harbouring potential pathogens (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Arcobacter) were enriched in certain sample types, and other risk-conferring signatures like the sul1 and erm(B) AMR genes were almost ubiquitous. Results were generally compatible with the existence of taxon-selecting mechanisms and reduced microbial diversity in the biofilms of plastic substrates, varying over seasons, polymer types and particle sizes. This study provided updated field data and insights on microplastic pollution in a major riverine environment. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

"Yokenella Regensburgei-Past, Present And Future","Yokenella regensburgei is a Gram-negative rod part of the Enterobacteriaceae family (order Enterobacterales) and a rare cause of human infections. Although improved diagnostic methods have led to an increase in reports of this elusive pathogen, information remains limited. In order to provide a better understanding of this bacterium, we developed the first comprehensive review of its biology, biochemical profile, antimicrobial resistance pattern, virulence factors, natural reservoir and involvement in various veterinary and human infections. Human infections with this bacterium are scarcely reported, most probably due to constraints regarding its identification and biochemical similarities to Hafnia alvei. Multiple systematic searches revealed 23 cases of human infection, with a seemingly worldwide distribution, mostly in middle-aged or elderly male patients, often associated with immunosuppression. To date, Y. regensburgei has been reported in skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and sepsis, osteoarticular infections and in others such as urinary tract and digestive infections. The unique ability of Y. regensburgei to degrade polystyrene presents a novel and promising avenue for addressing plastic pollution in the near future. However, large-scale applications of this bacterium will undoubtedly increase human exposure, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive research into its role in human and veterinary infections, pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance.","Toc, Da; Costache, C; Neculicioiu, Vs; Rusu, Im; Roznovan, Bv; Botan, A; Toc, Ag; Schiopu, P; Panaitescu, Ps; Pana, Ag; Colosi, Ia",10.3390/antibiotics13070589,Antibiotics-Basel
Microplastics Existence Intensified Bloom Of Antibiotic Resistance In Livestock Feces Transformed By Black Soldier Fly,"Efficient degradation of residual antibiotics in livestock and poultry feces by black soldier flies (BSFs) has been widely reported. Nevertheless, the effects of widely detected microplastics in feces on the dynamic reduction of antibiotics and the transfer of gut bacterial resistome remain unclear. In this study, red fluorescence-labeled microplastics are observed to be abundantly distributed in BSFs gut, which caused epithelial cell damage along with gut peristalsis and friction, thereby releasing reactive oxygen species and activating the antioxidant enzyme system. In addition, they result in not only in inflammatory cytokine release to induce gut inflammation, but fecal hardening because of mucus released from the BSFs, thereby hindering organic mineralization and antibiotic degradation. Besides, the gut pathogenic bacteria easily obtain growth energy and crowded out ecological niches by reducing nitrate produced by inflammatory host cells to nitrite with nitrate reductase. Consequently, linear discriminant analysis effect size and detrended correspondence analysis found that microplastic intake significantly reshape the microbial community structure and cause the significant reduction of several important organic-decomposing bacteria and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomonadales, Coriobacteriales, Lachnospirales, and Ruminococcaceae). In addition, a large number of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcaceae, Hungateiclostridiaceae, and Clostridia) are enriched in feces and BSFs gut. Weighted correlation network analysis and bubble diagram analysis indicate that microplastic intake intensified gut colonization of pathogenic bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes/mobile genetic elements, driving the bloom of antibiotic resistance in trans-formed fecal piles. Therefore, microplastics in feces should be isolated as much as possible before insect transformation.","Xu, Zm; Wu, Xy; Zhang, Jx; Cheng, P; Xu, Zh; Sun, Wm; Zhong, Ym; Wang, Yf; Yu, Gh; Liu, H",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120845,Environmental Pollution
"Bacterial Biofilms Colonizing Plastics In Estuarine Waters, With An Emphasis On Vibrio Spp. And Their Antibacterial Resistance","Since plastics degrade very slowly, they remain in the environment on much longer timescales than most natural organic substrates and provide a novel habitat for colonization by bacterial communities. The spectrum of relationships between plastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. The first objective of this study was to examine plastics as substrates for communities of Bacteria in estuarine surface waters. We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize communities from plastics collected in the field, and over the course of two colonization experiments, from biofilms that developed on plastic (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene) and glass substrates placed in the environment. Both field sampling and colonization experiments were conducted in estuarine tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. As a second objective, we concomitantly analyzed biofilms on plastic substrates to ascertain the presence and abundance ofVibriospp. bacteria, then isolated three human pathogens,V.cholerae,V.parahaemolyticus, andV.vulnificus, and determined their antibiotic-resistant profiles. In both components of this study, we compared our results with analyses conducted on paired samples of estuarine water. This research adds to a nascent literature that suggests environmental factors govern the development of bacterial communities on plastics, more so than the characteristics of the plastic substrates themselves. In addition, this study is the first to culture three pathogenic vibrios from plastics in estuaries, reinforcing and expanding upon earlier reports of plastic pollution as a habitat forVibriospecies. The antibiotic resistance detected among the isolates, coupled with the longevity of plastics in the aqueous environment, suggests biofilms on plastics have potential to persist and serve as focal points of potential pathogens and horizontal gene transfer.","Laverty, Al; Primpke, S; Lorenz, C; Gerdts, G; Dobbs, Fc",10.1371/journal.pone.0237704,Plos One
Potassium Ion Channels In Malignant Central Nervous System Cancers,"Simple Summary Malignant central nervous system (CNS) cancers are notoriously difficult to treat, with just one-third of patients surviving five years post-diagnosis. Their location within the brain and brainstem presents several challenges to successful treatment, including surgical inaccessibility and designing effective therapies that pass the brain's protective barrier. Furthermore, high-grade CNS cancer is also prone to recurrence, and the secondary tumours that arise are highly resistant to treatment. Potassium ion channels are a class of transmembrane proteins involved in maintaining the electrical microenvironment of cells. In cancers, these proteins are known to play a significant role in the development of cancer hallmarks like proliferation, invasion, and adaptive drug resistance. Our review explores the relationship between potassium ion channel function and the progression of malignant CNS cancers. Targeting these proteins presents a promising, novel treatment strategy, with several FDA-approved potassium ion channel-targeting drugs already in clinical use for various CNS disorders. Malignant central nervous system (CNS) cancers are among the most difficult to treat, with low rates of survival and a high likelihood of recurrence. This is primarily due to their location within the CNS, hindering adequate drug delivery and tumour access via surgery. Furthermore, CNS cancer cells are highly plastic, an adaptive property that enables them to bypass targeted treatment strategies and develop drug resistance. Potassium ion channels have long been implicated in the progression of many cancers due to their integral role in several hallmarks of the disease. Here, we will explore this relationship further, with a focus on malignant CNS cancers, including high-grade glioma (HGG). HGG is the most lethal form of primary brain tumour in adults, with the majority of patient mortality attributed to drug-resistant secondary tumours. Hence, targeting proteins that are integral to cellular plasticity could reduce tumour recurrence, improving survival. This review summarises the role of potassium ion channels in malignant CNS cancers, specifically how they contribute to proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and plasticity. We will also explore how specific modulation of these proteins may provide a novel way to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcomes.","Boyle, Y; Johns, Tg; Fletcher, E",10.3390/cancers14194767,Cancers
Investigating The Impact Of Nanoplastics In Altering The Efficacy Of Clarithromycin Antibiotics Through In Vitro Studies,"Plastics have significant global implications due to their environmental contamination from extensive use and improper disposal. Among plastic particles, nanoplastics (<1 mu m) pose notable risks to organisms and ecosystems due to their high surface area, reactivity, and potential to carry environmental pollutants. This study explores the interaction between polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and clarithromycin (CLA), a broad-spectrum antibiotic, focusing on their combined impact on insulin (INS) and antibiotic-resistant (AMR) bacteria. PSNPs can adsorb CLA, leading to structural changes in insulin and affecting its physiological functions, potentially causing insulin resistance. Additionally, PSNPs reduce CLA's inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria, facilitating antibiotic resistance. Our research utilized UV-Vis Spectroscopy, FTIR, Fluorescence spectroscopy, and Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to assess INS structural changes, alongside the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for microbiological examination. The findings highlight the synergistic and antagonistic effects of PSNPs and CLA, underscoring the enhanced toxicity of CLA when adsorbed onto PSNPs and the complex interactions affecting both human health and bacterial resistance. Further studies are essential to fully understand these mechanisms and their broader implications.","Pani, Bsul; Chandrasekaran, N",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125144,Environmental Pollution

Combined Effects Of Nanosized Polystyrene And Erythromycin On Bacterial Growth And Resistance Mutations In Escherichia Coli,"Toxicological effects of nanoplastics have been demonstrated in a variety of organisms, yet their impacts on bacteria, especially on the antibiotic resistance evolution remain under explored. Herein, we report individual and combined effects of nano-polystyrene (nano-PS) and erythromycin (ERY) on growth and resistance mutations of Escherichia coli. The toxicity of nano-PS was dependent on size and functional modifications, with 30 nm and amino-modified PS (PS-NH2, 200 nm) showing the greatest toxicity. Adsorption of nano-PS onto bacterial surface and the subsequent increase of intracellular ROS or the probable mechanical damage were considered as the primary toxic mechanisms. Furthermore, nano-PS increased the bacterial resistance mutations, which was due to the oxidative damage to DNA and the SOS response. In addition, PS-NH2 presented synergistic effects with ERY while non-modified PS had no impact, although both of them showed adsorption capacity to ERY. This was likely because the positively charged PS-NH2 acted as a carrier of ERY and enhanced the interactions between ERY and the bacteria. Our findings raised the concerns about the risk of nanoplastics in accelerating the bacterial resistance evolution, and highlighted the necessity of including combined effects of nanoplastics and cocontaminants in risk assessment.","Ning, Q; Wang, Dl; An, Jh; Ding, Q; Huang, Zy; Zou, Y; Wu, F; You, J",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126858,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Limited Evidence Of Spillover Of Antimicrobial-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae From Animal/Environmental Reservoirs To Humans In Vellore, India","BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae is a common opportunistic pathogen in humans, often associated with both virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes. K. pneumoniae have a highly plastic genome and can act as a vehicle for disseminating genetic information. Aiming to assess the impact of the human-animal-environment interface on AMR dissemination in K. pneumoniae we sampled and genome sequenced organisms from a range of environments and compared their genetic composition.MethodsRepresentative K. pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens (n = 59), livestock samples (n = 71), and hospital sewage samples (n = 16) during a two-year surveillance study were subjected to whole genome sequencing. We compared the taxonomic and genomic distribution of K. pneumoniae, AMR gene abundance, virulence gene composition, and mobile genetic elements between the three sources.ResultsThe K. pneumoniae isolates originating from livestock were clonally distinct from those derived from clinical/hospital effluent samples. Notably, the clinical and hospital sewage isolates typically possessed a greater number of resistance/virulence genes than those from animals. Overall, we observed a limited overlap of K. pneumoniae clones, AMR genes, virulence determinants, and plasmids between the different settings.ConclusionIn this setting, the spread of XDR and hypervirulent clones of K. pneumoniae appears to be restricted to humans with no obvious association with non-clinical sources. Emergent clones of K. pneumoniae carrying both resistance and virulence determinants are likely to have emerged in hospital settings rather than in animal or natural environments.

The Antibiotic Crisis: On The Search For Novel Antibiotics And Resistance Mechanisms,"In the relentless battle for human health, the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has emerged as an impending catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude, potentially driving humanity towards the brink of an unparalleled healthcare crisis. The unyielding advance of antibiotic resistance looms as the foremost threat of the 21st century in clinical, agricultural and environmental arenas. Antibiotic resistance is projected to be the genesis of the next global pandemic, with grim estimations of tens of millions of lives lost annually by 2050. Amidst this impending calamity, our capacity to unearth novel antibiotics has languished, with the past four decades marred by a disheartening 'antibiotic discovery void'. With nearly 80% of our current antibiotics originating from natural or semi-synthetic sources, our responsibility is to cast our investigative nets into uncharted ecological niches teeming with microbial strife, the so-called 'microbial oases of interactions'. Within these oases of interactions, where microorganisms intensively compete for space and nutrients, a dynamic and ever-evolving microbial 'arms race' is constantly in place. Such a continuous cycle of adaptation and counter-adaptation is a fundamental aspect of microbial ecology and evolution, as well as the secrets to unique, undiscovered antibiotics, our last bastion against the relentless tide of resistance. In this context, it is imperative to invest in research to explore the competitive realms, like the plant rhizosphere, biological soil crusts, deep sea hydrothermal vents, marine snow and the most modern plastisphere, in which competitive interactions are at the base of the microorganisms' struggle for survival and dominance in their ecosystems: identify novel antibiotic by targeting microbial oases of interactions could represent a 'missing piece of the puzzle' in our fight against antibiotic resistance. The looming threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is one of the major challenges of the 21st century across clinical, agricultural, and environmental domains. Despite this crisis, the antibiotic discovery has stagnated, emphasizing the urgent need to explore yet overlooked ecological niches teeming with microbial competition. For istance, by targeting 'microbial oases of interaction', such as the plant rhizosphere, biological soil crust, deep-sea and the more recent plastisphere, there is potential to uncover novel antibiotics. This approach represents a critical aspect of microbial ecology and evolution, offering a promising avenue in the battle against antibiotic resistance.image","Van Goethem, Mw; Marasco, R; Hong, Py; Daffonchio, D",10.1111/1751-7915.14430,Microbial Biotechnology

Pharmacotechnical Aspects Of A Stable Probiotic Formulation Toward Multidrug-Resistance Antibacterial Activity: Design And Quality Control,"As a well-known group of the probiotic family, the Lactobacillus has increasingly contributed to hindering the growth of pathogens, particularly resistant species, in the last decades. Since antibiotic resistance has become a severe problem in global healthcare systems and considerably increased the mortality and morbidity rate in infectious diseases, we aimed to obtain a new stable formulation of Lactobacillus to overcome resistant infections. For this purpose, we designed various gel formulations containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a water base and oil base gel, evaluated the probiotic stability in formulation to obtain an optimum formulation, and finally, investigated the antibacterial activities of that against two common hospital-associated multidrug-resistant pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Furthermore, the pharmaceutical aspects of the optimum formulation, including stability, homogeneity, spreadability, pH value, conductivity, and rheological behavior, were assessed.The results indicated that the optimum formulation based on glycerol exhibited desirable pharmaceutical properties, including long-term stability, a perfect level of homogeneity, an acceptable range of spreadability with pseudo-plastic thixotropic behavior, and a promising antibacterial potential against MRSA and VRE. Our findings indicate that this novel probiotic formulation could be an excellent candidate to cope with antibiotic-resistant species, representing a hopeful treatment potential for topical applications, particularly in incurable infections. However, further in vivo studies seem warranted to evaluate their bactericidal activity against multi-drug resistant microorganisms.","Karimi, F; Azadi, A; Omidifar, N; Najafabady, Nm; Mohammadi, F; Kazemi, R; Gholami, A",10.1186/s12906-023-04224-0,Bmc Complementary Medicine And Therapies
Ascl1 Is Activated Downstream Of The Ror2/Creb Signaling Pathway To Support Lineage Plasticity In Prostate Cancer,"Lineage plasticity is a form of therapy-induced drug resistance. In prostate cancer, androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors potentially lead to the accretion of tumor relapse with loss of AR signaling and a shift from a luminal state to an alternate program. However, the molecular and signaling mechanisms orchestrating the development of lineage plasticity under the pressure of AR-targeted therapies are not fully understood. Here, a survey of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) identifies ROR2 as the top upregulated RTK following AR pathway inhibition, which feeds into lineage plasticity by promoting stem-cell-like and neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ROR2 activates the ERK/CREB signaling pathway to modulate the expression of the lineage commitment transcription factor ASCL1. Collectively, our findings nominate ROR2 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the ENZ-induced plastic phenotype and potentially re-sensitize tumors to AR pathway inhibitors.","Tabrizian, N; Nouruzi, S; Cui, Cj; Kobelev, M; Namekawa, T; Lodhia, I; Talal, A; Sivak, O; Ganguli, D; Zoubeidi, A",10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112937,Cell Reports
Phenotypically Plastic Drug-Resistant Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Cell Line Displays Enhanced Cellular Dynamics In A Zebrafish Xenograft Model,"Understanding the mechanisms by which cancer cells switch between different adaptive states and evade therapeutic interventions is essential for clinical management. In this study, the in vivo cellular dynamics of a new chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line displaying altered phenotype and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors were investigated in correlation with their parental cells for invasiveness/metastasis, angiogenic potential and population kinetics. We showed that the cells exhibiting drug resistance and plastic phenotype possess an increased capacity for invasion compared to their parental cells, that exposure to imatinib mesylate has the potential to enhance cellular motility and that in a leukaemic cell population, even a minority of plastic cells exhibit improved migratory ability. Furthermore, we show that these plastic cells have angiogenic and extravasation potential. The present study provides significant insights into the cellular dynamics displayed by a TKI-resistant, phenotypically plastic CML cell line, using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) xenograft model.","Baykal, S; Yuce, Z; Ozhan, G",10.1111/jcmm.70105,Journal Of Cellular And Molecular Medicine
Acinetobacter Nosocomialis Utilizes A Unique Type Vi Secretion System To Promote Its Survival In Niches With Prey Bacteria,"Pathogenic bacteria of the Acinetobacter genus pose a severe threat to human health worldwide due to their strong adaptability, tolerance, and antibiotic resistance. Most isolates of these bacteria harbor a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that allows them to outcompete co-residing microorganisms, but whether this system is involved in acquiring nutrients from preys remains less studied. In this study, we found that Ab25, a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter nosocomialis, utilizes a T6SS to kill taxonomically diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. The T6SS of Ab25 is constitutively expressed, and among the three predicted effectors, T6e1, a member of the RHS effector family, contributes the most for its antimicrobial activity. T6e1 undergoes self-cleavage, and a short carboxyl fragment with nuclease activity is sufficient to kill target cells via T6SS injection. Interestingly, strain Ab25 encodes an orphan VgrG protein, which when overexpressed blocks the firing of its T6SS. In niches such as dry plastic surfaces, the T6SS promotes prey microorganism-dependent survival of Ab25. These results reveal that A. nosocomialis employs T6SSs that are highly diverse in their regulation and effector composition to gain a competitive advantage in environments with scarce nutrient supply and competing microbes. IMPORTANCE The type VI secretion system (T6SS) plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to environmental challenges. Members of the Acinetobacter genus, particularly A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis, are notorious for their multidrug resistance and their ability to survive in harsh environments. In contrast to A. baumannii, whose T6SS has been well-studied, few research works have focused on A. nosocomialis. In this study, we found that an A. nosocomialis strain utilizes a contitutively active T6SS to kill diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. Although T6SS structural proteins of A. nosocomialis are similar to those of A. baumannii, the effector repertoire differs greatly. Interestingly, the T6SS of the A. nosocomialis strain codes for an ophan VgrG protein, which blocks the firing of the system when overexpressed, suggesting the existence of a new regulatory mechanism for the T6SS. Importantly, although the T6SS does not provide an advantage when the bacterium is grown in nutrient-rich medium, it allows A. nosocomialis to survive better in dry surfaces that contain co-existing bacteria. Our results suggest that killing of co-residing microorganisms may increase the effectiveness of strategies designed to reduce the fitness of Acinetobacter bacteria by targeting their T6SS.","Sun, Y; Wang, Ld; Zhang, M; Jie, J; Guan, Qt; Fu, Jq; Chu, X; Chen, D; Li, C; Song, L; Luo, Zq",10.1128/mbio.01468-24,Mbio
The Impact Of Gene Dosage And Heterozygosity On The Diploid Pathobiont Candida Albicans,"Candida albicans is a fungal species that can colonize multiple niches in the human host where it can grow either as a commensal or as an opportunistic pathogen. The genome of C. albicans has long been of considerable interest, given that it is highly plastic and can undergo a wide variety of alterations. These changes play a fundamental role in determining C. albicans traits and have been shown to enable adaptation both to the host and to antifungal drugs. C. albicans isolates contain a heterozygous diploid genome that displays variation from the level of single nucleotides to largescale rearrangements and aneuploidy. The heterozygous nature of the genome is now increasingly recognized as being central to C. albicans biology, as the relative fitness of isolates has been shown to correlate with higher levels of overall heterozygosity. Moreover, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events can arise frequently, either at single polymorphisms or at a chromosomal level, and both can alter the behavior of C. albicans cells during infection or can modulate drug resistance. In this review, we examine genome plasticity in this pathobiont focusing on how gene dosage variation and loss of heterozygosity events can arise and how these modulate C. albicans behavior.","Liang, Sh; Bennett, Rj",10.3390/jof6010010,Journal Of Fungi
The Multixenobiotic Resistance System As A Possible Protective Response Triggered By Microplastic Ingestion In Mediterranean Mussels (Mytilus Galloprovincialis): Larvae And Adult Stages,"The emerging paradigm on plastic pollution in marine environments is that micronize particles (MPs) have far more subtle effects than bigger fragments, given their size range overlapping with that of particles ingested by filter-feeders. The impacts include gut blockage, altered feeding and energy allocation, with knock-on effects on widespread physiological processes. This study investigated whether ingestion of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) triggers protective processes in marine mussels. The Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) system is a cytoprotective mechanism acting as an active barrier against harmful xenobiotics and a route of metabolite detoxification. Both larvae and adults were employed in laboratory experiments with different concentrations of 3-mu m PS-MPs (larvae), and 3-mu m and 45-mu m PS-MPs (adults) matching size range of planktonic food through the mussel lifecycle. Embryos grown in the presence of 3-mu m PS-MPs showed significant reduction of MXR activity and down-regulation of ABCB and ABCC transcripts encoding the two main MXR-related transporters P-glycoprotein and the Multidrug resistance-related protein, respectively. In adults, effects of PS-MPs were assessed in haemocytes and gills, which showed different modulation of MXR activity and ABCB/ABCC expression according to MP size (haemocyte and gills) or particle concentration (haemocyte). These data showed that modulation of MXR activity is part of a generalized response triggered by particle ingestion.","Franzellitti, S; Capolupo, M; Wathsala, Rhgr; Valbonesi, P; Fabbri, E",10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.02.005,Comparative Biochemistry And Physiology C-Toxicology & Pharmacology
"Antibiotic Sorption Onto Microplastics In Water: A Critical Review Of The Factors, Mechanisms And Implications","Microplastics as vectors for contaminants in the environment is becoming a topic of public interest. Microplastics have been found to actively adsorb heavy metals, per-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated bi-phenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and polybrominated diethers (PBDs) onto their surface. Particular interest in microplastics capacity to adsorb antibiotics needs further attention due to the potential role this interaction plays on antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic sorption experiments have been documented in the literature, but the data has not yet been critically reviewed. This review aims to comprehensively assess the factors that affect antibiotic sorption onto microplastics. It is recognised that the physico- chemical properties of the polymers, the antibiotic chemical properties, and the properties of the solution all play a crucial role in the antibiotic sorption capacity of microplastics. Weathering of microplastics was found to increase the antibiotic sorption capacity by up to 171%. An increase in solution salinity was found to decrease the sorption of antibiotics onto microplastics, in some instances by 100%. pH also has a substantial effect on sorption capacity, illustrating the significance of electrostatic interactions on the sorption of antibiotics onto microplastics. The need for a uniform experimental design when testing antibiotic sorption is highlighted to remove inconsistencies in the data currently presented. Current literature examines the link between antibiotic sorption and antibiotic resistance, however, further studies are still required to fully understand this emerging global crisis.","Stapleton, Mj; Ansari, Aj; Hai, Fi",10.1016/j.watres.2023.119790,Water Research
Miniaturized Real-Time Pcr On A Q3 System For Rapid Kras Genotyping,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an aggressive human malignancy with a complex genomic landscape harboring KRAS mutations. In 40%-60% of patients with CRC, constantly active KRAS proteins affect the prognosis, surgical strategy, and clinical benefit from therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents. For this reason, there is a greater demand for minimally-invasive diagnostic devices to characterize the genetic pattern and prevent the acquired mechanism to drug resistance. The rapid developments in cutting-edge diagnostic techniques are expected to play a growing role in medicine and represent an attractive promise to identify potential responders to personalized medicine. Here we propose a new method to simultaneously detect the main KRAS mutations on the portable real-time PCR Q3 platform. This platform is based on hybrid silicon-plastic technology implemented in a miniaturized chip able to achieve a sample-in answer-out rapid analysis, allowing a new approach to genetic counseling and testing.","Guarnaccia, M; Iemmolo, R; Petralia, S; Conoci, S; Cavallaro, S",10.3390/s17040831,Sensors
The Microbial Etiology And Resistance Patterns Of Cosmetic Tourism-Related Infections In Ireland,"BackgroundCosmetic tourism is an increasingly common phenomenon, both in Ireland and internationally. Complications associated with procedures performed abroad may manifest after the patient has traveled back to their home country with patients often presenting to local health services. Such complications can be infectious in nature requiring either antimicrobial therapy and/or source control in the form of wound debridement or radiologically guided interventional procedures.MethodsPatients who had presented to a regional plastic surgery unit between September 2021 and December 2022 with complications related to aesthetic procedures performed outside Ireland were identified in this retrospective-prospective design. Medical records were reviewed to ascertain what procedures were performed, where the procedure had taken place, the nature of complications, and microbial culture and sensitivity results.ResultsThirty patients were identified during the study timeframe, predominantly female (n = 28) with a mean age of 40.27 years (SD 10.6). Abdominoplasty was the most common procedure (n = 17), and Turkey was the most frequently cited destination (70%). Wound dehiscence accounted for the majority of complications (n = 18). Wound cultures were obtained in 80% (n = 24) of patients and a causative organism was isolated in 85% (n = 34) of cultures. Eighteen species of bacteria were identified and antimicrobial sensitivities were obtained for 16 of these. Antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed empiric antibiotics was noted in several isolates.ConclusionPost-operative infections related to cosmetic tourism are a growing concern in plastic surgery. The bacterial etiology is varied, and antimicrobial resistance poses significant challenges, highlighting the need for early intervention and wound cultures to guide effective management.","Keane, A; Feeley, Aa; Chee, Sy; Sheil, F; O'Gorman, J; O'Neill, E; Cahill, Kc",10.1007/s11845-024-03800-8,Irish Journal Of Medical Science
Determination Of The Relationship Between Expression And Functional Activity Of Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 1 Using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy,"Cancer cells can develop multidrug resistance (MDR) after prolonged exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, which is a severe impediment to successful treatment. MDR is typically associated with transmembrane proteins mediating efflux of administered drugs, thereby keeping their intracellular concentration below the threshold required to kill cells. Although expression assays based on flow cytometry and immunostaining have shown that multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) is prevalent in many cancer types, the functional activity of this efflux pump is more difficult to elucidate, especially at the single-cell level. Herein, we report the measurement of MRP1 functional activity in individual cancer cells using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Cells were cultured onto plastic substrates containing selective adhesion sites. Optical microscopy and SECM revealed that cells adapt to the underlying surface, while MRP1 functional activity increases once the dimensions of the adhesive islands become smaller than those of the cell itself. Timelapse SECM imaging revealed a suitable window of 30 min to complete each measurement before the cell undergoes blebbing, which is associated with a considerable increase in functional activity. Distinct cell populations were produced by performing a doxorubicin drug challenge on two parental cell lines (e.g., wild-type HeLa cells and MRP1-overexpressing HeLa-R cells). Expression and functional activity of MRP1 were determined using flow cytometry and SECM, and our findings show that these parameters do not directly correlate. This suggests that functional activity may represent a powerful indicator of a cancer cell's response to chemotherapeutic treatment and should improve our understanding of efflux mechanisms based on MRP1.","Polcari, D; Hernández-Castro, Ja; Li, K; Geissler, M; Mauzeroll, J",10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01601,Analytical Chemistry
Incidence Of Drug-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Strains In Organic And Conventional Watermelons Grown In Tennessee,"The production and consumption of organic fresh produce have constantly increased since the 1990s. Consumers prefer organic produce because it does not contain synthetic chemical residues that are often implicated in health problems. The contamination of fresh produce by pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae strains remains a major challenge, and is responsible for frequent foodborne disease outbreaks. The use of antibiotics has proved an effective treatment, but the increase in occurrences of antibiotic resistance is becoming a health challenge. This study seeks to establish the presence of antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on organic and conventional watermelon fruits. Watermelons used for this study were cultivated at the Tennessee State University Certified Organic Farm, Nashville. At harvest, nine fruits were selected from among fruits lying on plastic mulch, and nine from fruits lying on the soil of both organic and conventional plots. These were placed in sterile sample bags for microbial analysis. Spread plating technique, API 20E, and apiweb software were used for microbial isolation and identification. Identified strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance against 12 common antibiotics. Seventeen Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated and identified. Isolates were susceptible to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, but were resistant to cefoxitin. Citrobacter freundii showed a 14.3% resistance to Streptomycin. Pantoea spp. and Providencia rettigeri showed 50% and 100% resistance to tetracycline. Findings from this study confirm the presence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains on organic watermelons in Nashville, TN.","Akaeze, O; Kilonzo-Nthenge, A; Nandwani, D; Mafiz, Ai; Nzomo, M; Aniume, T",10.3390/foods11213316,Foods
N6-Methyladenosine (M6A) In Cancer Stem Cell: From Molecular Mechanisms To Therapeutic Implications,"The emergence of drug resistance and metastasis has long been a difficult problem for cancer treatment. Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cell populations are key factors in the regulation of cancer aggressiveness, relapse and drug resistance. Cancer stem cell (CSC) populations are highly plastic and self-renewing, giving them unique metabolic, metastatic, and chemotherapy resistance properties. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification of mRNA and is involved in a variety of cell growth and development processes, including RNA transcription, alternative splicing, degradation, and translation. It has also been linked to the development of various cancers. At present, the important role of m6A in tumour progression is gradually attracting attention, especially in the tumour stemness regulation process. Abnormal m6A modifications regulate tumour metastasis, recurrence and drug resistance. This paper aims to explore the regulatory mechanism of m6A in CSCs and clinical therapy, clarify its regulatory network, and provide theoretical guidance for the develop-ment of clinical targets and improvement of therapeutic effects.","Wang, Lm; Tang, Yx",10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114846,Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy
Virulence And Antibiotic Resistance Plasticity Of Arcobacter Butzleri: Insights On The Genomic Diversity Of An Emerging Human Pathogen,"Arcobacter butzleri is a foodborne emerging human pathogen, frequently displaying a multidrug resistant character. Still, the lack of comprehensive genome-scale comparative analysis has limited our knowledge on A. butzleri diversification and pathogenicity. Here, we performed a deep genome analysis of A. butzleri focused on decoding its core- and pan-genome diversity and specific genetic traits underlying its pathogenic potential and diverse ecology. A. butzleri (genome size 2.07-2.58 Mbp) revealed a large open pan-genome with 7474 genes (about 50% being singletons) and a small but diverse core-genome with 1165 genes. It presents a plastic virulome (including newly identified determinants), marked by the differential presence of multiple adaptation-related virulence factors, such as the urease cluster ureD(AB)CEFG (phenotypically confirmed), the hypervariable hemagglutinin-encoding hecA, a type I secretion system (T1SS) harboring another agglutinin and a novel VirB/D4 T4SS likely linked to interbacterial competition and cytotoxicity. In addition, A. butzleri harbors a large repertoire of efflux pumps (EPs) and other antibiotic resistant determinants. We unprecedentedly describe a genetic mechanism of A. butzleri macrolides resistance, (inactivation of a TetR repressor likely regulating an EP). Fluoroquinolones resistance correlated with Thr-85-Ile in GyrA and ampicillin resistance was linked to an OXA-15-like beta-lactamase. Remarkably, by decoding the polymorphism pattern of the main antigen PorA, we show that A. butzleri is able to exchange porA as a whole and/or hypervariable epitope-encoding regions separately, leading to a multitude of chimeric PorA presentations that can impact pathogen-host interaction during infection. Ultimately, our unprecedented screening of short sequence repeats indicates that phase variation likely modulates A. butzleri key adaptive functions. In summary, this study constitutes a turning point on A. butzleri comparative genomics revealing that this human gastrointestinal pathogen is equipped with vast and diverse virulence and antibiotic resistance arsenals that open a multitude of phenotypic fingerprints for environmental/host adaptation and pathogenicity.","Isidro, J; Ferreira, S; Pinto, M; Domingues, F; Oleastro, M; Gomes, Jp; Borges, V",10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104213,Infection Genetics And Evolution
Transcriptional Activity Of Detoxification Genes Is Altered By Ultraviolet Filters In Chironomus Riparius,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters are compounds used to prevent the damage produced by UV radiation in personal care products, plastics, etc. They have been associated with endocrine disruption, showing anti-estrogen activity in vertebrates and altering the ecdysone pathway in invertebrates. Although they have attracted the attention of multiple research teams there is a lack of data about how animals activate detoxification systems, especially in invertebrates. Here, analysis of the effects of two UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), on the transcriptional activity of nine genes covering the three steps of the detoxification process has been performed. Four cytochrome P450 genes belonging to different members of this family, five GST genes, and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) gene were studied by RT-PCR to analyze their transcriptional activity in fourth instar larvae exposed to the UV filters for 8 and 24 h. The obtained results show a differential response with downregulation of the different Cyp450s tested by 4MBC while BP3 seems not to modify their expression. On the other hand, some of the GST genes were affected by one or other of the filters, showing a less homogenous response. Finally, MRP1 was activated by both filters but at different times. These results demonstrate for first time that UV filters alter the expression of genes involved in the different steps of the detoxification process and that they can be processed by phase I enzymes other than Cyp450s. They also suggest that UV filters affect biotransformation processes, compromising the ability of the individual to respond to chemical stress, so further research is needed to know the extent of the damage that they can produce in the resistance of the cell to chemicals.","Martínez-Guitarte, Jl",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.11.017,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
"Microplastic Biofilm, Associated Pathogen And Antimicrobial Resistance Dynamics Through A Wastewater Treatment Process Incorporating A Constructed Wetland","Microplastics in wastewater are colonized by biofilms containing pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that can be exported into receiving water bodies. This study investigated establishment and changes in microplastic-associated biofilm and AMR during a conventional full-scale 2100 population equivalent waste-water treatment process combined with a free water surface polishing constructed wetland. Sequential micro -plastic colonization experiments were conducted at different stages of the wastewater treatment process, including in raw sewage, treated effluent and the constructed wetland. Two scenarios were tested in which the constructed wetland served as either (i) a polishing step or (ii) as primary recipient of sewage inoculated microplastics. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was carried out for qualitative bacterial community analysis. qPCR was applied for quantitative analysis of AMR genes (sul1, ermB, tetW, intiI1), bacterial biomass (16S rRNA) and a human fecal marker (HF183). Microbial diversity on microplastics increased with incubation time. The initial sewage-derived biofilm composition changed more significantly in the wastewater effluent compared to the constructed wetland. Pathogen and AMR load decreased by up to two orders of magnitude after coupled conventional and constructed wetland treatment, while less impact was observed when sewage-inoculated microplastic material was directly transferred into the constructed wetland. Aeromonas, Klebsiella, and Strep-tococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with AMR in microplastic-associated biofilms. Despite decreasing trends on human pathogens and AMR load along the treatment process, microplastic-associated biofilms were a considerable potential hotspot for AMR (intI1 gene) and accommodated Cyanobacteria and fish pathogens.","Bydalek, F; Webster, G; Barden, R; Weightman, Aj; Kasprzyk-Hordern, B; Wenk, J",10.1016/j.watres.2023.119936,Water Research
Management Of Biofilm With Breast Implant Surgery,"Bacterial infection of aesthetic and reconstructive breast implants is a common and expensive problem. Subacute infections or chronic capsular contractures leading to device explantation are the most commonly documented sequelae. Although bench and translational research underscores the complexities of implant-associated infection, high-quality studies with adequate power, control groups, and duration of follow-up are lacking. Common strategies to minimize infections use antibiotics-administered systemically, in the breast implant pocket, or by directly bathing the implant before insertion-to limit bacterial contamination. Limiting contact between the implant and skin or breast parenchyma represents an additional common strategy. The clinical prevention of breast implant infection is challenged by the clean-contaminated nature of breast parenchyma, and the variable behavior of not only specific bacterial species but also their strains. These factors impact bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance.","Myckatyn, Tm; Ramirez, Jmd; Walker, Jn; Hanson, Bm",10.1097/PRS.0000000000010791,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
"Mycoplasma Agalactiae Vaccines: Current Status, Hurdles, And Opportunities Due To Advances In Pathogenicity Studies","Contagious agalactia (CA) is a serious multietiological disease whose classic etiological agent is Mycoplasma agalactiae and which causes high morbidity and mortality rates in infected herds. CA is classified as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health due to its significant worldwide economic impact on livestock, primarily involving goat and sheep farms. The emergence of atypical symptoms and strains of M. agalactiae in wildlife ungulates reestablishes its highly plastic genome and is also of great epidemiological significance. Antimicrobial therapy is the main form of control, although several factors, such as intrinsic antibiotic resistance and the selection of resistant strains, must be considered. Available vaccines are few and mostly inefficient. The virulence and pathogenicity mechanisms of M. agalactiae mainly rely on surface molecules that have direct contact with the host. Because of this, they are essential for the development of vaccines.

Extracellular Matrix-Mediated Regulation Of Cancer Stem Cells And Chemoresistance,"The identity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains an enigma, with the question outstanding of whether CSCs are fixed entities or plastic cell states in response to microenvironmental cues. Recent evidence highlights the power of the tumor microenvironment to dictate CSC functionality and spatiotemporal regulation that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity. This microenvironmental regulation of CSCs parallels that of normal tissues, whereby resident stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or 'niches', which provide the cellular and molecular signals that wire every aspect of stem cell behavior and fate. The extracellular matrix (ECM), along with its sequestered growth factors, is a fundamental component of the stem cell niche. Pathological ECM remodeling is an established hallmark of cancer, with the ECM a key mediator of metastasis and drug resistance. In this review, we discuss the controversial identity of CSCs and new understanding of the impact of tumor microenvironment on CSC function and phenotype. We outline parallels between development, wound repair and cancer to discuss how changes in ECM dynamics influence stem cell function during normal physiological processes and pathological states, as well as the transition between the two in the form of precancerous lesions. We then explore examples illustrating the molecular circuits partnering cancer cells with stromal cells and how this communication involving ECM imparts a CSC phenotype and promotes chemoresistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CSC functionality and chemoresistance, along with mathematical modeling approaches and advancing technologies for targeting the undruggable proteome, should open opportunities for cancer breakthroughs in the future.","Brown, Y; Hua, S; Tanwar, Ps",10.1016/j.biocel.2019.02.002,International Journal Of Biochemistry & Cell Biology
Surgical Antimicrobial Prophylaxis In Pediatric Patients Undergoing Plastic Surgery: A Rand/Ucla Appropriateness Method Consensus Study,"For many years, it was clearly shown that surgical procedures might be associated with surgical site infection (SSI). Many scientific institutions prepared guidelines to use in surgery to reduce abuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, in the general guidelines for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, plastic surgical procedures are not addressed or are only marginally discussed, and children were almost systematically excluded. The main aim of this Consensus document is to provide clinicians with recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis for pediatric patients undergoing plastic surgery. The following scenarios were considered: clean plastic surgery in elective procedures with an exclusive skin and subcutis involvement; clean-contaminated/contaminated plastic surgery in elective procedures with an exclusive skin and subcutis involvement; elective plastic surgery with use of local flaps; elective plastic surgery with the use of grafts; prolonged elective plastic surgery; acute burns; clean contused lacerated wounds without bone exposure; high-risk contused lacerated wounds or with bone exposure; contused lacerated wound involving the oral mucosa; plastic surgery following human bite; plastic surgery following animal bite; plastic surgery with tissue expander insertion. Our Consensus document shows that antimicrobial perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing plastic surgery is recommended in selected cases. While waiting the results of further pediatric studies, the application of uniform and shared protocols in these procedures will improve surgical practice, with a reduction in SSIs and consequent rationalization of resources and costs, as well as limiting the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance.","Esposito, S; Sgarzani, R; Bianchini, S; Monaco, S; Nicoletti, L; Rigotti, E; Di Pietro, M; Opri, R; Caminiti, C; Ciccia, M; Conti, G; Donà, D; Giuffré, M; La Grutta, S; Lancella, L; Lima, M; Lo Vecchio, A; Pelizzo, G; Piacentini, G; Pietrasanta, C; Puntoni, M; Simonini, A; Venturini, E; Staiano, A; Principi, N",10.3390/antibiotics11040506,Antibiotics-Basel

Ulceration has been shown to increase the risk of developing surgical site infection following excision, with some studies finding infection rates of 33%. However, no specific guidelines for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in such cases exist. We surveyed 129 clinicians (covering Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery, and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery) who all excise skin lesions on a regular basis. There was significant variability in their practice with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, with 9% always prescribing them and 19% never prescribing them. Variation exists both among and between specialities. This variation increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and shows a paucity of good clinical evidence, indicating that a well-designed clinical trial is needed to guide future practice.","Totty, Jp; Matin, Rn; Wernham, A; Ray, R; Thomas-Jones, E; Abbott, Ra",10.1111/ced.15075,Clinical And Experimental Dermatology

Human Wharton'S Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome Display Antiproliferative Effect On Leukemia Cell Line And Produce Additive Cytotoxic Effect In Combination With Doxorubicin,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy moves toward clinic progressively. Recent evidences establish anticancer effect of mesenchymal stem cells. However multiple factors including type of cancer, MSC source, study design, and animal model play role in final outcome. Wharton's jelly - a newly approved source of MSCs - possesses superiorities to bone marrow as the conventional source; therefore investigation of its medical effects can produce beneficial results. In this survey we examined cytotoxic and proapoptotic effect of human Wharton's jelly MSC secretome on K562 human leukemia cells. MSCs were isolated from human Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord by explant culture method, then characterized according to ISCT criteria (morphology and plastic adherence, surface antigenicity and differentiation potential). MSC secretome was collected and its cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects on K562 cells in combination with doxorubicin were evaluated using BrdU cell proliferation assay and Annexin V-PI staining. Our results showed antiproliferative effect of mesenchymal stem cell secretome on K562 cancer cells, the effect was also added to cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin without induction of drug resistance. Human Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells exerted cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells. Addition of that effect to anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents can leads to cytotoxic drug dose reduction and diminished side effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Adsorptive Removal Of Ciprofloxacin And Sulfamethoxazole From Aqueous Matrices Using Sawdust And Plastic Waste-Derived Biochar: A Sustainable Fight Against Antibiotic Resistance,"We produced carbon-negative biochar from the pyrolysis of sawdust biomass alone (SB) and from the co pyrolysis of sawdust and plastic waste (SPB). The co-pyrolysis approach in this study was driven by several hypothetical factors, such as increased porosity, surface chemistry, stability, as well as waste management. We applied pyrolyzed and co-pyrolyzed biochars for the removal of ciprofloxacin (CFX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Due tYo its more alkaline and amorphous nature, SB showed better removal efficiencies compared to SPB. The maximum removals of CFX and SMX with SB were observed as similar to 95% and >95%, respectively whereas with SPB were 58.8%, and 34.9%, respectively. The primary mechanisms involved in the adsorption process were H bonding, electrostatic and 7C-7C electron donor-acceptor interactions. Homogenously and heterogeneously driven adsorption of both antibiotics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, implying electron sharing/transfer (chemisorption) mediated adsorption. The work is highly pertinent in the context of emerging concerns related to drivers that promote antimicrobial resistance.","Silori, R; Zang, J; Raval, Np; Giri, Bs; Mahlknecht, J; Mora, A; Dueñas-Moreno, J; Tauseef, Sm; Kumar, M",10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129537,Bioresource Technology
Mechanism Of Ecm-Induced Dormancy And Chemoresistance In A549 Human Lung Carcinoma Cells,"It is now widely accepted that the tumor microenvironment influences the fate of cancer cells and plays crucial roles in regulating tumor dormancy and chemoresistance. The standard cell culture system on plastic surfaces does not account for cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and is thus a less reliable approach to analyze cellular activity ex vivo. In the present study, A549 lung cancer cells were cultured in a semi-solid growth substrate (Matrigel) to mimic the tumor microenvironment and to investigate the role played by ECM proteins, as well as to evaluate the mechanism of cell-ECM communication. A549 cells embedded in semisolid Matrigel exhibited dormant cell characteristics, including decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion rates, compared with the corresponding cells cultured on plastic plates. Exposure of A549 cells to Matrigel leads to resistance against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide, paclitaxel, vinblastine, doxorubicin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose). Cell cycle distribution analysis indicated that a larger percentage of the cells embedded within semi-solid Matrigel was arrested in the G0/G1 phase. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that A549 cells cultured in semi-solid Matrigel exhibited a marked decrease in the expression levels of genes that are related to tumor progression and invasion (uPA, uPAR, MMP2, MMP7, MMP9 and CXCR4). The effects of altering various signaling pathways, such as p-ERK, p-Akt and p-STAT3, were evaluated, in order to assess whether these pathways could account for the observed responses of the cells. The inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt activation using specific inhibitors induced G0/G1 arrest and drug resistance. These results demonstrated that Matrigel drove A549 cells into a drug-resistant dormancy state, most likely through inhibition of the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Cell culture within semi-solid Matrigel offered a simple in vitro model for studying the mechanisms responsible for tumor dormancy and drug resistance. These studies may lead to therapeutic approaches that can eliminate dormant tumor cells and prevent disease recurrence.","Keeratichamroen, S; Lirdprapamongkol, K; Svasti, J",10.3892/or.2018.6258,Oncology Reports
Gold-Polyoxoborates Nanocomposite Prohibits Adsorption Of Bacteriophages On Inner Surfaces Of Polypropylene Labware And Protects Samples From Bacterial And Yeast Infections,"Bacteriophages (phages) are a specific type of viruses that infect bacteria. Because of growing antibiotic resistance among bacterial strains, phage-based therapies are becoming more and more attractive. The critical problem is the storage of bacteriophages. Recently, it was found that bacteriophages might adsorb on the surfaces of plastic containers, effectively decreasing the titer of phage suspensions. Here, we showed that a BOA nanocomposite (gold nanoparticles embedded in polyoxoborate matrix) deposited onto the inner walls of the containers stabilizes phage suspensions against uncontrolled adsorption and titer decrease. Additionally, BOA provides antibacterial and antifungal protection. The application of BOA assures safe and sterile means for the storage of bacteriophages.","Wdowiak, M; Ochirbat, E; Paczesny, J",10.3390/v13071206,Viruses-Basel
Superhydrophobic Tipped Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Device For The In Vivo Treatment Of Periodontitis Using A Wistar Rat Model,"Limited options exist for treatment of periodontitis; scaling and root planing (SRP) are not sufficient to eradicate P. gingivalis and the resulting inflammatory disease. Chlorhexidine (CHX), used as an adjuvant to SRP, may reduce bacterial loads but leads to pain and staining, while evidence for its efficacy is lacking. Antibiotics are effective but can lead to drug-resistance. The rising concern of antibiotic resistance limits the future use of this treatment approach. This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel superhydrophobic (SH) antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) device as an adjuvant to SRP for the treatment of periodontitis induced in a Wistar rat in vivo model relative to CHX. The SH-aPDT device comprises an SH silicone rubber strip coated with verteporfin photosensitizer (PS), sterilized, and secured onto a tapered plastic optical fiber tip connected to a red diode laser. The superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) strips were fabricated by using a novel soluble template method that creates a medical-grade elastomer with hierarchical surface roughness without the use of nanoparticles. Superhydrophobicity minimizes direct contact of the PS-coated surface with bacterial biofilms. Upon insertion of the device tip into the pocket and energizing the laser, the device generates singlet oxygen that effectively targets and eliminates bacteria within the periodontal pocket. SH-aPDT treatment using 125 J/cm(2) of red light on three consecutive days reduced P. gingivalis significantly more than SRP-CHX controls (p < 0.05). Clinical parameters significantly improved (p < 0.05), and histology and stereometry results demonstrated SH-aPDT to be the most effective treatment for improving healing and reducing inflammation, with an increase in fibroblast cells and extracellular matrix and a reduction in vascularization, inflammatory cells, and COX-2 expression. The SH-aPDT approach resulted in complete disease clearance assessed 30 days after treatment initiation with significant reduction of the periodontal pocket and re-formation of the junctional epithelium at the enamel-cementum junction. PS isolation on a SH strip minimizes the potential for bacteria to develop resistance, where the treatment may be aided by the oxygen supply retained within the SH surface.","Tonon, Cc; Rastelli, And; Bodahandi, C; Ghosh, G; Hasan, T; Xu, Qf; Greer, A; Lyons, Am",10.1021/acsami.3c12820,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Identifying Drug Resistant Cancer Cells Using Microbubble Well Arrays,"Drug resistance is a characteristic of tumor initiating cells that can give rise to metastatic disease. In this work we demonstrate the use of microbubble well arrays as a cell culture platform to enumerate and characterize drug resistant cells in a human derived tumorigenic squamous cell carcinoma cell line. The spherical architecture and compliant hydrophobic composition of the microbubble well favors single cell survival, clonal proliferation and formation of spheres that do not grow on standard tissue culture plastic and are resistant to cisplatin. Spheres form in isolation and in microbubble wells containing proliferating cells and to some degree they stain positive for common stem cell markers CD44 and CD133. Spheres are also observed in cellularized primary human tumors cultured in microbubble arrays. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential for microbubble array technology to enumerate cancer cells resistant to standard care drugs with the ability to test alternative drug combinations. This capability can be developed for designing patient specific treatment strategies. Recovery of drug-resistant cells will allow a more full characterization of their gene expression profile thereby expanding our fundamental knowledge and ability to develop new targets to fight metastatic disease.","Pu, Qh; Spooner, R; Delouise, La",10.1007/s10544-017-0160-9,Biomedical Microdevices
Nanoplastic Ingestion Enhances Toxicity Of Persistent Organic Pollutants (Pops) In The Monogonont Rotifer Brachionus Koreanus Via Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Disruption,"Among the various materials found inside microplastic pollution, nanosized microplastics are of particular concern due to difficulties in quantification and detection; moreover, they are predicted to be abundant in aquatic environments with stronger toxicity than microsized microplastics. Here, we demonstrated a stronger accumulation of nanosized microbeads in the marine rotifer Brachionus koreanus compared to microsized ones, which was associated with oxidative stress-induced damages on lipid membranes. In addition, multixenobiotic resistance conferred by P-glycoproteins and multidrug resistance proteins, as a first line of membrane defense, was inhibited by nanoplastic pre-exposure, leading to enhanced toxicity of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether and triclosan in B. koreanus. Our study provides a molecular mechanistic insight into the toxicity of nanosized microplastics toward aquatic invertebrates and further implies the significance of synergetic effects of microplastics with other environmental persistent organic pollutants.","Jeong, Cb; Kang, Hm; Lee, Yh; Kim, Ms; Lee, Js; Seo, Js; Wang, Mh; Lee, Js",10.1021/acs.est.8b03211,Environmental Science & Technology
A Biomaterial Screening Approach Reveals Microenvironmental Mechanisms Of Drug Resistance,"Traditional drug screening methods lack features of the tumor microenvironment that contribute to resistance. Most studies examine cell response in a single biomaterial platform in depth, leaving a gap in understanding how extracellular signals such as stiffness, dimensionality, and cell-cell contacts act independently or are integrated within a cell to affect either drug sensitivity or resistance. This is critically important, as adaptive resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment. We developed an approach to screen drug responses in cells cultured on 2D and in 3D biomaterial environments to explore how key features of ECM mediate drug response. This approach uncovered that cells on 2D hydrogels and spheroids encapsulated in 3D hydrogels were less responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeting drugs sorafenib and lapatinib, but not cytotoxic drugs, compared to single cells in hydrogels and cells on plastic. We found that transcriptomic differences between these in vitro models and tumor xenografts did not reveal mechanisms of ECM-mediated resistance to sorafenib. However, a systems biology analysis of phospho-kinome data uncovered that variation in MEK phosphorylation was associated with RTK-targeted drug resistance. Using sorafenib as a model drug, we found that co-administration with a MEK inhibitor decreased ECM-mediated resistance in vitro and reduced in vivo tumor burden compared to sorafenib alone. In sum, we provide a novel strategy for identifying and overcoming ECM-mediated resistance mechanisms by performing drug screening, phospho-kinome analysis, and systems biology across multiple biomaterial environments.","Schwartz, Ad; Barney, Le; Jansen, Le; Nguyen, Tv; Hall, Cl; Meyer, As; Peyton, Sr",10.1039/c7ib00128b,Integrative Biology
Spontaneous Mutation Rate Is A Plastic Trait Associated With Population Density Across Domains Of Life,"Rates of random, spontaneous mutation can vary plastically, dependent upon the environment. Such plasticity affects evolutionary trajectories and may be adaptive. We recently identified an inverse plastic association between mutation rate and population density at 1 locus in 1 species of bacterium. It is unknown how widespread this association is, whether it varies among organisms, and what molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis or repair are required for this mutation-rate plasticity. Here, we address all 3 questions. We identify a strong negative association between mutation rate and population density across 70 years of published literature, comprising hundreds of mutation rates estimated using phenotypic markers of mutation (fluctuation tests) from all domains of life and viruses. We test this relationship experimentally, determining that there is indeed density-associated mutation-rate plasticity (DAMP) at multiple loci in both eukaryotes and bacteria, with up to 23-fold lower mutation rates at higher population densities. We find that the degree of plasticity varies, even among closely related organisms. Nonetheless, in each domain tested, DAMP requires proteins scavenging the mutagenic oxidised nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP. This implies that phenotypic markers give a more precise view of mutation rate than previously believed: having accounted for other known factors affecting mutation rate, controlling for population density can reduce variation in mutation-rate estimates by 93%. Widespread DAMP, which we manipulate genetically in disparate organisms, also provides a novel trait to use in the fight against the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Such a prevalent environmental association and conserved mechanism suggest that mutation has varied plastically with population density since the early origins of life.","Krasovec, R; Richards, H; Gifford, Dr; Hatcher, C; Faulkner, Kj; Belavkin, Rv; Channon, A; Aston, E; Mcbain, Aj; Knight, Cg",10.1371/journal.pbio.2002731,Plos Biology
Epidemiology And Resistance Patterns Of Bacterial And Fungal Colonization Of Biliary Plastic Stents: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Background Plastic stents used for the treatment of biliary obstruction will become occluded over time due to microbial colonization and formation of biofilms. Treatment of stent-associated cholangitis is often not effective because of inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents or antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to assess the current bacterial and fungal etiology of stentassociated biofilms, with particular emphasis on antimicrobial resistance. Methods Patients with biliary strictures requiring endoscopic stent placement were prospectively enrolled. After the retrieval of stents, biofilms were disrupted by sonication, microorganisms were cultured, and isolates were identified by matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and/or biochemical typing. Finally, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for various antimicrobial agents. Selected stents were further analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results Among 120 patients (62.5% males, median age 64 years) with biliary strictures (35% malignant, 65% benign), 113 double pigtail polyurethane and 100 straight polyethylene stents were analyzed after a median indwelling time of 63 days (range, 1-1274 days). The stent occlusion rate was 11.5% and 13%, respectively, being associated with a significantly increased risk of cholangitis (38.5% vs. 9.1%, P<0.001). Ninety-five different bacterial and 13 fungal species were detected; polymicrobial colonization predominated (95.8% vs. 4.2%, P<0.001). Enterococci (79.3%), Enterobacteriaceae (73.7%), and Candida spp. (55.9%) were the leading pathogens. Candida species were more frequent in patients previously receiving prolonged antibiotic therapy (63% vs. 46.7%, P = 0.023). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci accounted for 13.7%, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)producing Enterobacteriaceae with co-resistance to ciprofloxacin accounted for 13.9%, and azole-resistant Candida spp. accounted for 32.9% of the respective isolates. Conclusions Enterococci and Candida species play an important role in the microbial colonization of biliary stents. Therefore, empirical antimicrobial treatment of stent-associated cholangitis should be guided toward enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, anaerobes, and Candida. To determine causative pathogens, an accurate microbiological analysis of the extracted stent(s) may be helpful.","Lübbert, C; Wendt, K; Feisthammel, J; Moter, A; Lippmann, N; Busch, T; Mössner, J; Hoffmeister, A; Rodloff, Ac",10.1371/journal.pone.0155479,Plos One
Microplastics In The Insular Marine Environment Of The Southwest Indian Ocean Carry A Microbiome Including Antimicrobial Resistant (Amr) Bacteria: A Case Study From Reunion Island,"The increasing threats to ecosystems and humans from marine plastic pollution require a comprehensive assessment. We present a plastisphere case study from Reunion Island, a remote oceanic island located in the Southwest Indian Ocean, polluted by plastics. We characterized the plastic pollution on the island's coastal waters, described the associated microbiome, explored viable bacterial flora and the presence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria. Reunion Island faces plastic pollution with up to 10,000 items/km2 in coastal water. These plastics host microbiomes dominated by Proteobacteria (80 %), including dominant genera such as Psychrobacter, Photobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio. Culturable microbiomes reach 107 CFU/g of microplastics, with dominance of Exiguobacterium and Pseudomonas. Plastics also carry AMR bacteria including beta-lactam resistance. Thus, Southwest Indian Ocean islands are facing serious plastic pollution. This pollution requires vigilant monitoring as it harbors a plastisphere including AMR, that threatens pristine ecosystems and potentially human health through the marine food chain.","Sababadichetty, L; Miltgen, G; Vincent, B; Guilhaumon, F; Lenoble, V; Thibault, M; Bureau, S; Tortosa, P; Bouvier, T; Jourand, P",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115911,Marine Pollution Bulletin
First Identification Of A Patient With Prosthesis-Related Infection Caused By An Mcr-1.1-Producing St131 Escherichia Coli After Rhinoplasty,"Background: The most common procedure of rhinoplasty is the implantation of a synthetic prosthesis. However, the complications, especially postoperative infection, could lead the suboptimal aesthetic outcome, economic losses and health threats. There is currently little literature providing an incidence of rhinoplasty infection and microbiological and antimicrobial resistance situations. Methods: Therefore, we performed a retrospective observational study which included 173 patients who received a rhinoplasty from 1 January 2015, to 31 December 2019, in the department of plastic surgery of a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China. The samples from the infection site were collected and performed the bacterial culture. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by VITEK and minimum inhibition concentration testing. The whole-genome sequencing was performed by Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. Results: We found that eight (4.6%) patients were infected by S. aureus (6), E. raffinosus (1) and E. coli (1), of which are susceptible to most antimicrobials. Remarkably, E. coli RS1231 was resistant to colistin and polymyxin B which conferred by mcr-1.1 locating on an IncI2 plasmid with 59,170-bp sequence length. Through sequence comparison, we speculate that the pRS1231S-MCR-1 was derived from animal sources. Besides, E. coli RS1231 belongs to ST131 025:H4-fimH22 pandemic subclone and phylogroup B2, which can induce a broad variety of infections. Conclusion: Our study provided a rhinoplasty infection incidence, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance prevalence data, and revealed, to our knowledge, the first case of postoperative infection of rhinoplasty by mcr-1.1-positive, highly susceptible, and remarkably virulent E. coli isolate.","Li, Zh; Shi, R; Wu, H; Yan, P",10.2147/IDR.S295801,Infection And Drug Resistance
Myeloid Cells That Impair Immunotherapy Are Restored In Melanomas With Acquired Resistance To Braf Inhibitors,"Acquired resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors (BRAFi) in melanoma remains a common clinical obstacle, as is the case for any targeted drug therapy that can be developed given the plastic nature of cancers. Although there has been significant focus on the cancer cell-intrinsic properties of BRAFi resistance, the impact of BRAFi resistance on host immunity has not been explored. Here we provide preclinical evidence that resistance to BRAFi in an autochthonous mouse model of melanoma is associated with restoration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment, initially reduced by BRAFi treatment. In contrast to restoration of MDSCs, levels of T regulatory cells remained reduced in BRAFi-resistant tumors. Accordingly, tumor gene expression signatures specific for myeloid cell chemotaxis and homeostasis reappeared in BRAFi-resistant tumors. Notably, MDSC restoration relied upon MAPK pathway reactivation and downstream production of the myeloid attractant CCL2 in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. Strikingly, although combination checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1) was ineffective against BRAFi-resistant melanomas, the addition of MDSC depletion/ blockade (anti-Gr-1 + CCR2 antagonist) prevented outgrowth of BRAFi-resistant tumors. Our results illustrate how extrinsic pathways of immunosuppression elaborated by melanoma cells dominate the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need to target extrinsic as well as intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance.","Steinberg, Sm; Shabaneh, Tb; Zhang, Ps; Martyanov, V; Li, Zh; Malik, Bt; Wood, Ta; Boni, A; Molodtsov, A; Angeles, Cv; Curiel, Tj; Whitfield, Ml; Turk, Mj",10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1755,Cancer Research
Heterogeneity In Circulating Tumor Cells: The Relevance Of The Stem-Cell Subset,"The release of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into vasculature is an early event in the metastatic process. The analysis of CTCs in patients has recently received widespread attention because of its clinical implications, particularly for precision medicine. Accumulated evidence documents a large heterogeneity in CTCs across patients. Currently, the most accepted view is that tumor cells with an intermediate phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal have the highest plasticity. Indeed, the existence of a meta-stable or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell state, with both epithelial and mesenchymal features, can be easily reconciled with the concept of a highly plastic stem-like state. A close connection between EMT and cancer stem cells (CSC) traits, with enhanced metastatic competence and drug resistance, has also been described. Accordingly, a subset of CTCs consisting of CSC, present a stemness profile, are able to survive chemotherapy, and generate metastases after xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. In the present review, we discuss the current evidence connecting CTCs, EMT, and stemness. An improved understanding of the CTC/EMT/CSC connections may uncover novel therapeutic targets, irrespective of the tumor type, since most cancers seem to harbor a pool of CSCs, and disclose important mechanisms underlying tumorigenicity.","Agnoletto, C; Corrà, F; Minotti, L; Baldassari, F; Crudele, F; Cook, Wjj; Di Leva, G; D'Adamo, Ap; Gasparini, P; Volinia, S",10.3390/cancers11040483,Cancers
Antifungal Activity Of Ionic Liquids Based On (-)-Menthol: A Mechanism Study,"The mechanism of toxicity of chiral ionic liquids with (1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthol [C-n-Am-Men][Cl] (n = 10, 11 or 12) in the fungus Candida albicans is reported here. Ionic liquids were more toxic towards Candida strain lacking all identified multidrug resistance efflux pumps. Moreover, the compounds tested inhibited C. albicans filamentation at the concentration at which detached fungal cells also adhered to the plastic surface. Our results showed the high activity of all the tested chiral ionic liquids in the permeabilization of C albicans' membranes and in the digestion and interruption of the cell wall. The investigated ionic liquids thus have potential as disinfectants because besides their antifungal and antiadhesive action these compounds do not cause hemolysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

"The Relevance Of Using 3D Cell Cultures, In Addition To 2D Monolayer Cultures, When Evaluating Breast Cancer Drug Sensitivity And Resistance","Solid tumours naturally grow in 3D wherein the spatial arrangement of cells affects how they interact with each other. This suggests that 3D cell culture may mimic the natural in vivo setting better than traditional monolayer (2D) cell culture, where cells are grown attached to plastic. Here, using HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines as models (BT474, HCC1954, EFM192A), the effects of culturing cells in 3D using the poly-HEMA method compared to 2D cultures were assessed in terms of cellular viability, response/ resistance to anti-cancer drugs, protein expression and enzyme activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed the morphology of cells in 3D to be substantially different to those cultured in 2D. Cell viability in 3D cells was substantially lower than that of cells in 2D cultures, while 3D cultures were more resistant to the effects of HER-targeted (neratinib) and classical chemotherapy (docetaxel) drugs. Expression of proteins involved in cell survival, transporters associated with drug resistance and drug targets were increased in 3D cultures. Finally, activity of drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4 was substantially increased in 3D compared to 2D cultures. Together this data indicates that the biological information represented by 3D and 2D cell cultures is substantially different i.e. 3D cell cultures demonstrate higher innate resistance to anti-cancer drugs compared to 2D cultures, which may be facilitated by the altered receptor proteins, drug transporters and metabolising enzyme activity. This highlights the importance of considering 3D in addition to 2D culture methods in pre-clinical studies of both newer targeted and more traditional anti-cancer drugs.","Breslin, S; O'Driscoll, L",10.18632/oncotarget.9935,Oncotarget
Partial Emt In Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Snapshot,"In the process of cancer EMT, some subgroups of cancer cells simultaneously exhibit both mesenchymal and epithelial characteristics, a phenomenon termed partial EMT (pEMT). pEMT is a plastic state in which cells coexpress epithelial and mesenchymal markers. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pEMT is regulated, and the phenotype is maintained via the HIPPO pathway, NOTCH pathway and TGF-beta pathways and by microRNAs, lncRNAs and the cancer microenvironment (CME); thus, SCC exhibits aggressive tumorigenic properties and high stemness, which leads collective migration and therapy resistance. Few studies have reported therapeutic interventions to address cells that have undergone pEMT, and this approach may be an effective way to inhibit the plasticity, drug resistance and metastatic potential of SCC.","Liao, Cc; Wang, Q; An, Jx; Long, Q; Wang, H; Xiang, Ml; Xiang, Ml; Zhao, Yj; Liu, Yl; Liu, Jg; Guan, Xy",10.7150/ijbs.61566,International Journal Of Biological Sciences
Synthetic And Natural Rubber Associated Chemicals Drive Functional And Structural Changes As Well As Adaptations To Antibiotics In In Vitro Marine Microbiomes,"The leaching of additives from plastics and elastomers (rubbers) has raised concerns due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemicals extracted from two types of rubber on microbiomes derived from a benthic sea urchin and two pelagic fish species. Additionally, we examined whether bacterial communities preconditioned with rubber-associated chemicals displayed adaptations to antibiotics. At the highest tested concentrations of chemicals, we observed reduced maximum growth rates and yields, prolonged lag phases, and increased alpha diversity. While the effects on alpha and beta diversity were not always conclusive, several bacterial genera were significantly influenced by chemicals from the two rubber sources. Subsequent exposure of sea urchin microbiomes preconditioned with rubber chemicals to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin resulted in decreased maximum growth rates. This indicates a more sensitive microbiome to ciprofloxacin when preconditioned with rubber chemicals. Although no significant interaction effects between rubber chemicals and ciprofloxacin exposure were observed in bacterial alpha and beta diversity, we observed log-fold changes in two bacterial genera in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings highlight the structural and functional alterations in microbiomes originating from various marine species when exposed to rubber-associated chemicals and underscore the potential risks posed to marine life.","Carlsen, Ecl; Hjelset, S; Gomes, T; Igartua, A; Sorensen, L; Booth, Am; Hylland, K; Eiler, A",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116134,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Plastic Structures For Diverse Substrates: A Revisit Of Human Abc Transporters,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest groups of primary active transporters that could be found in all kingdoms of life from bacteria to humans. In humans, ABC transporters can selectively transport a wide spectrum of substrates across membranes, thus playing a pivotal role in multiple physiological processes. In addition, due to the ability of exporting clinic therapeutics, some ABC transporters were originally termed multidrug resistance proteins. Increasing investigations of human ABC transporters in recent years have provided abundant information for elucidating their structural features, based on the structures at distinct states in a transport cycle. This review focuses on the recent progress in human ABC structural analyses, substrate binding specificities, and translocation mechanisms. We dedicate to summarize the common features of human ABC transporters in different subfamilies, and to discuss the possibility to apply the fast-developing techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy, and artificial intelligence-assisted structure prediction, for future studies.","Hou, Wt; Xu, D; Wang, L; Chen, Y; Chen, Zp; Zhou, Cz; Chen, Yx",10.1002/prot.26406,Proteins-Structure Function And Bioinformatics
Microplastics Aggravate The Bioaccumulation Of Two Waterborne Veterinary Antibiotics In An Edible Bivalve Species: Potential Mechanisms And Implications For Human Health,"Edible bivalves are one of the major types of seafood and may be subject to antibiotic and microplastics (MPs) coexposure under realistic scenarios. However, the effect of MPs on the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in edible bivalves and subsequent health risks for consumers remain poorly understood. Therefore, the bioaccumulation of two frequently detected veterinary antibiotics, oxytetracycline (OTC) and florfenicol (FLO), with or without the copresence of MPs was investigated in the blood clam. Health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated dams were also assessed. Furthermore, the activity of GST and expression of key detoxification genes were analyzed as well. The bioaccumulation of OTC and FLO in clams was found to be aggravated by MPs. Because the estimated target hazard quotients (THQs) were far less than the critical value, direct toxic effects of consuming contaminated clams are negligible. However, the dietary exposure doses of the human gut microbiota (DEGM) to the antibiotics tested were greater than or similar to corresponding minimum selective concentrations (MSC), indicating a potential antibiotic resistance risk. Moreover, the GST activity and expression of detoxification genes were significantly suppressed by MPs, suggesting that the disruption of detoxification represents one possible explanation for the aggravated bioaccumulation observed here.","Zhou, Ws; Han, Y; Tang, Y; Shi, W; Du, Xy; Sun, Sg; Liu, Gx",10.1021/acs.est.0c01575,Environmental Science & Technology
"Interactions Of Microplastics, Antibiotics And Antibiotic Resistant Genes Within Wwtps","Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in atmosphere, soil, and water and have been characterized as contaminants of emerging concern. When exposed to these environments, MPs interact with the chemical compounds as well as the (micro)organisms inhabiting these ecosystems. This paper overviews the interactions and significant factors influencing the sorption process of antibiotics on MPs since distinct interactions are developed between MPs and antibiotics. The interplay between the MPs and the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) microbial hosts is presented and the important factors that may shape the plastisphere resistome are discussed. The interactions of MPs, antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were discussed with the aim to provide a perspective for better understanding of the role of WWTPs in bringing together MPs, antibiotics and ARB/ARGs and further as release points of MPs carrying antibiotics, and ARB/ARGs.

Bacterial Genome Wide Association Studies (Bgwas) And Transcriptomics Identifies Cryptic Antimicrobial Resistance Mechanisms Inacinetobacter Baumannii,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the nosocomial pathogen,Acinetobacter baumannii, is becoming a serious public health threat. While some mechanisms of AMR have been reported, understanding novel mechanisms of resistance is critical for identifying emerging resistance. One of the first steps in identifying novel AMR mechanisms is performing genotype/phenotype association studies; however, performing these studies is complicated by the plastic nature of theA. baumanniipan-genome. In this study, we compared the antibiograms of 12 antimicrobials associated with multiple drug families for 84A. baumanniiisolates, many isolated in Arizona, USA.in silicoscreening of these genomes for known AMR mechanisms failed to identify clear correlations for most drugs. We then performed a bacterial genome wide association study (bGWAS) looking for associations between all possible 21-mers; this approach generally failed to identify mechanisms that explained the resistance phenotype. In order to decrease the genomic noise associated with population stratification, we compared four phylogenetically-related pairs of isolates with differing susceptibility profiles. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on paired isolates and differentially-expressed genes were identified. In these isolate pairs, five different potential mechanisms were identified, highlighting the difficulty of broad AMR surveillance in this species. To verify and validate differential expression, amplicon sequencing was performed. These results suggest that a diagnostic platform based on gene expression rather than genomics alone may be beneficial in certain surveillance efforts. The implementation of such advanced diagnostics coupled with increased AMR surveillance will potentially improveA. baumanniiinfection treatment and patient outcomes.","Roe, C; Williamson, Chd; Vazquez, Aj; Kyger, K; Valentine, M; Bowers, Jr; Phillips, Pd; Harrison, V; Driebe, E; Engelthaler, Dm; Sahl, Jw",10.3389/fpubh.2020.00451,Frontiers In Public Health
Cancer Drug Resistance Induced By Emt: Novel Therapeutic Strategies,"Over the last decade, important clinical benefits have been achieved in cancer patients by using drug-targeting strategies. Nevertheless, drug resistance is still a major problem in most cancer therapies. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) and tumour microenvironment have been described as limiting factors for effective treatment in many cancer types. Moreover, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has also been associated with therapy resistance in many different preclinical models, although limited evidence has been obtained from clinical studies and clinical samples. In this review, we particularly deepen into the mechanisms of which intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) states and its interconnection to microenvironment influence therapy resistance. We also describe how the use of bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics will help to figure out the biological impact of the EMT on drug resistance and to develop novel pharmacological approaches in the future.","De Las Rivas, J; Brozovic, A; Izraely, S; Casas-Pais, A; Witz, Ip; Figueroa, A",10.1007/s00204-021-03063-7,Archives Of Toxicology
Pilot Investigation On Biostability Of Drinking Water Distribution Systems Under Water Source Switching,"Water quality deterioration of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) caused by water source switching has been reported previously. However, systematic investigation of the biostability of DWDS under water source switching is limited. Aged pipes, including three commonly used pipe materials dug out from a practical DWDS, were used to systematically investigate the biofilm stability mechanism of DWDS under water source switching to quality-improved water. An increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in the bulk water during the initial stage of the switching period was observed, indicating the risk of biofilm release through aged pipe surfaces after water source switching. Sloughing of biofilms might contribute to temporary instability. From day 35, the ATP concentration in the polyethylene (PE) and plastic stainless steel composite (PS) pipes were maintained at approximately 2.40 and 2.56 ng/L, respectively. In contrast, the ATP concentration in the ductile iron (DI) pipes was higher, at approximately 3.43 ng/L from day 42. The water quality variation could cause areas of the biofilm to slough and reduce the biomass of biofilm, causing partial alteration of the microbial community. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing-based functional prediction revealed that the biofilm could increase the abundance of chlorine-resistant bacteria attributed to the increase in Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium after switching to quality-improved water. Moreover, the profiles of specific pathways linked to human diseases, antibiotic resistance, and antibiotic biosynthesis revealed that the safety of the biofilm could improve after switching to quality-improved water.","Zhang, Kj; Wu, Xg; Zhang, Tq; Cen, C; Mao, Ry; Pan, Rj",10.1007/s00253-022-12050-6,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
Polystyrene Nanoparticles Induce Biofilm Formation In Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"In recent years, micro/nanoplastics have garnered widespread attention due to their ecological risks. In this study, we investigated the effects of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS -NPs) of different sizes on the growth and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The results demonstrated that exposure to certain concentrations of PS -NPs significantly promoted bacterial biofilm formation. Meanwhile, we comprehensively revealed its mechanism whereby PS -NPs induced oxidative stress and altered bacterial membrane permeability by contacting or penetrating bacterial membranes. To counteract the stimulation by PS -NPs and reduce their toxicity, bacteria enhanced biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of biofilm-related genes, increasing EPS and virulence factors secretion, and enhancing bacterial motility through the participation of the quorum sensing (QS) system. Additionally, we also found that exposure to PS -NPs enhanced bacterial antibiotic resistance, posing a challenge to antimicrobial therapy. Our study reveals the toxic effects of nanoplastics and the defense mechanisms of bacteria, which has important implications for the risk assessment and management of environmental nanoplastics.","Huang, P; Li, Z; Liu, Rd; Bartlam, M; Wang, Yy",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133950,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Trail Receptor-Induced Features Of Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition Increase Tumour Phenotypic Heterogeneity: Potential Cell Survival Mechanisms,"The continuing efforts to exploit the death receptor agonists, such as the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), for cancer therapy, have largely been impaired by the anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signalling pathways leading to drug resistance. Cell migration, invasion, differentiation, immune evasion and anoikis resistance are plastic processes sharing features of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that have been shown to give cancer cells the ability to escape cell death upon cytotoxic treatments. EMT has recently been suggested to drive a heterogeneous cellular environment that appears favourable for tumour progression. Recent studies have highlighted a link between EMT and cell sensitivity to TRAIL, whereas others have highlighted their effects on the induction of EMT. This review aims to explore the molecular mechanisms by which death signals can elicit an increase in response heterogeneity in the metastasis context, and to evaluate the impact of these processes on cell responses to cancer therapeutics.","Peyre, L; Meyer, M; Hofman, P; Roux, J",10.1038/s41416-020-01177-w,British Journal Of Cancer
Novel Phage-Derived Depolymerase With Activity Against Proteus Mirabilis Biofilms,"The adherence of Proteus mirabilis to the surface of urinary catheters leads to colonization and eventual blockage of the catheter lumen by unique crystalline biofilms produced by these opportunistic pathogens, making P. mirabilis one of the leading causes of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The Proteus biofilms reduce efficiency of antibiotic-based treatment, which in turn increases the risk of antibiotic resistance development. Bacteriophages and their enzymes have recently become investigated as alternative treatment options. In this study, a novel Proteus bacteriophage (vB_PmiS_PM-CJR) was isolated from an environmental sample and fully characterized. The phage displayed depolymerase activity and the subsequent genome analysis revealed the presence of a pectate lyase domain in its tail spike protein. The protein was heterologously expressed and purified; the ability of the purified tail spike to degrade Proteus biofilms was tested. We showed that the application of the tail spike protein was able to reduce the adherence of bacterial biofilm to plastic pegs in a MBEC (minimum biofilm eradication concentration) assay and improve the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with Proteus mirabilis. Our study is the first to successfully isolate and characterize a biofilm depolymerase from a Proteus phage, demonstrating the potential of this group of enzymes in treatment of Proteus infections.","Rice, Cj; Kelly, Sa; O'Brien, Sc; Melaugh, Em; Ganacias, Jcb; Chai, Zh; Gilmore, Bf; Skvortsov, T",10.3390/microorganisms9102172,Microorganisms
Silver Nanoparticle-Loaded Titanium-Based Metal-Organic Framework For Promoting Antibacterial Performance By Synergistic Chemical-Photodynamic Therapy,"The abuse of antibiotics leads to an increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which not only causes a waste of medical resources but also seriously endangers people's health and life safety. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an efficient antibacterial strategy to reduce the reliance on traditional antibiotics. Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is regarded as an intriguing antimicrobial method that is less likely to generate drug resistance, but its efficiency still needs to be further improved. Herein, a robust titanium-based metal-organic framework ACM-1 was adopted to support Ag nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain Ag NPs@ACM-1 for boosting antibacterial efficiency via synergistic chemical-photodynamic therapy. Apart from the intrinsic antibacterial nature, Ag NPs largely boost ROS production and thus improve aPDT efficacy. As a consequence, Ag NPs@ACM-1 shows excellent antibacterial activity under visible light illumination, and its minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA are as low as 39.1, 39.1, and 62.5 mu g mL(-1), respectively. Moreover, to expand the practicability of Ag NPs@ACM-1, two (a dense and a loose) Ag NPs@ACM-1 films were readily fabricated by simply dispersing Ag NPs@ACM-1 into heated aqueous solutions of edible agar and sequentially cooling through heating or freeze-drying, respectively. Notably, these two films are mechanically flexible and exhibit excellent antibacterial activities, and their antimicrobial performances can be well retained in their recyclable and remade films. As agar is nontoxic, degradable, inexpensive, and ecosustainable, the dense and loose Ag NPs@ACM-1 films are potent to serve as recyclable and degradable antibacterial plastics and antibacterial dressings, respectively.","Zhan, Xp; Zeng, Yn; Li, Bx; Zheng, Hq; Feng, Hx; Xu, Zq; Liu, Jy; Lin, Zj",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c03555,Inorganic Chemistry
Single-Cell Analysis Of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines Reveals Diverse Expression Patterns Of Individual Cells Invoked By A Molecular Target Drug Treatment,"Background: To understand the heterogeneous behaviors of individual cancer cells, it is essential to investigate gene expression levels as well as their divergence between different individual cells. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing-related technologies have enabled us to conduct a single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of a series of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Results: We analyze a total of 336 single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from seven cell lines. The results are highly robust regarding both average expression levels and the relative gene expression differences between individual cells. Gene expression diversity is characteristic depending on genes and pathways. Analyses of individual cells treated with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib reveal that, while the ribosomal genes and many other so-called house-keeping genes reduce their relative expression diversity during the drug treatment, the genes that are directly targeted by vandetanib, the EGFR and RET genes, remain constant. Rigid transcriptional control of these genes may not allow plastic changes of their expression with the drug treatment or during the cellular acquisition of drug resistance. Additionally, we find that the gene expression patterns of cancer-related genes are sometimes more diverse than expected based on the founder cells. Furthermore, we find that this diversity is occasionally latent in a normal state and initially becomes apparent after the drug treatment. Conclusions: Characteristic patterns in gene expression divergence, which would not be revealed by transcriptome analysis of bulk cells, may also play important roles when cells acquire drug resistance, perhaps by providing a cellular reservoir for gene expression programs.","Suzuki, A; Matsushima, K; Makinoshima, H; Sugano, S; Kohno, T; Tsuchihara, K; Suzuki, Y",10.1186/s13059-015-0636-y,Genome Biology
Antibiotic Therapy In Reconstructive Surgery Of Deep Sternal Wound Infections,"The choice of antibiotics and length of administration in the treatment of deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) is unclear. The reason for this is the lack of studies and local differences in resistance. An increase in resistance can be observed in gram-positive cocci, which are the most frequently detected in deep sternal infections. The duration of administration is often 2- 6 weeks or longer, although the benefit of prolonged antibiotic administration has not been confirmed by studies. We evaluated the antibiotic treatment during surgical treatment, consisting of surgical wound debridement and plastic chest reconstruction. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients (n = 260) who underwent reconstructive surgery in the Department of Plastic Surgery at Leipzig University Hospital from 01.05.2012 - 31.12.2020. The duration of intake, results of microbiological swabs and resistance were investigated. RESULTS: At the time of discharge, closedwound conditions were noted in 177 of 260 cases (68.1%). The largest proportion of patients (n = 238) was treated with a latissimus dorsi flap (91.5%). Antibiotic treatment was conducted in 206 of 260 cases (79.2%). The mean duration of antibiotic administration was 21.4 days (+/- 17.6). Prolonged treatment over 14 days did not alter outcome (p = 0.226), in contrast, the number of multidrug resistances (p < 0.001). There was no prove of resistance against linezolid which is effective against the most common found infectious agents Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 93; 24.0 %) & Staphylococcus aureus (n = 47; 12.1 %). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotic therapy over 14 days, whereas multidrug resistance increases with prolonged antibiotic use. In the absence of infectious agents or clinical signs of inflammation, surgical treatment without additional antibiotic treatment is effective. Linezolid is a suitable antibiotic in the treatment of gram-positive infections which are the most frequent in DSWI.","Unbehaun, P; Prantl, L; Langer, S; Spindler, N",10.3233/CH-238121,Clinical Hemorheology And Microcirculation
"The Intimate Relationship Among Emt, Met And Tme: A T(Ransdifferentiation) E(Nhancing) M(Ix) To Be Exploited For Therapeutic Purposes","Simple Summary Intratumoral heterogeneity is considered the major cause of drug resistance and hence treatment failure in cancer patients. Tumor cells are known for their phenotypic plasticity that is the ability of a cell to reprogram and change its identity to eventually adopt multiple phenotypes. Tumor cell plasticity involves the reactivation of developmental programs, the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties and an enhanced potential for retro- or transdifferentiation. A well-known transdifferentiation mechanism is the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Current evidence suggests a complex interplay between EMT, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and various signals from the tumor microenvironment (TME) in shaping a tumor cell's plasticity. The vulnerabilities exposed by cancer cells when residing in a plastic or stem-like state have the potential to be exploited therapeutically, i.e., by converting highly metastatic cells into less aggressive or even harmless postmitotic ones. Intratumoral heterogeneity is considered the major cause of drug unresponsiveness in cancer and accumulating evidence implicates non-mutational resistance mechanisms rather than genetic mutations in its development. These non-mutational processes are largely driven by phenotypic plasticity, which is defined as the ability of a cell to reprogram and change its identity (phenotype switching). Tumor cell plasticity is characterized by the reactivation of developmental programs that are closely correlated with the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties and an enhanced potential for retrodifferentiation or transdifferentiation. A well-studied mechanism of phenotypic plasticity is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Current evidence suggests a complex interplay between EMT, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and clues from the tumor microenvironment in cell reprogramming. A deeper understanding of the connections between stem cell, epithelial-mesenchymal, and tumor-associated reprogramming events is crucial to develop novel therapies that mitigate cell plasticity and minimize the evolution of tumor heterogeneity, and hence drug resistance. Alternatively, vulnerabilities exposed by tumor cells when residing in a plastic or stem-like state may be exploited therapeutically, i.e., by converting them into less aggressive or even postmitotic cells. Tumor cell plasticity thus presents a new paradigm for understanding a cancer's resistance to therapy and deciphering its underlying mechanisms.","Hass, R; Von Der Ohe, J; Ungefroren, H",10.3390/cancers12123674,Cancers
Novel Functional Insights Into The Microbiome Inhabiting Marine Plastic Debris: Critical Considerations To Counteract The Challenges Of Thin Biofilms Using Multi-Omics And Comparative Metaproteomics,"BackgroundMicrobial functioning on marine plastic surfaces has been poorly documented, especially within cold climates where temperature likely impacts microbial activity and the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms. To date, only two studies have used metaproteomics to unravel microbial genotype-phenotype linkages in the marine 'plastisphere', and these have revealed the dominance of photosynthetic microorganisms within warm climates. Advancing the functional representation of the marine plastisphere is vital for the development of specific databases cataloging the functional diversity of the associated microorganisms and their peptide and protein sequences, to fuel biotechnological discoveries. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment for plastisphere metaproteomics, using multi-omics and data mining on thin plastic biofilms to provide unique insights into plastisphere metabolism. Our robust experimental design assessed DNA/protein co-extraction and cell lysis strategies, proteomics workflows, and diverse protein search databases, to resolve the active plastisphere taxa and their expressed functions from an understudied cold environment.ResultsFor the first time, we demonstrate the predominance and activity of hydrocarbonoclastic genera (Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas) within a primarily heterotrophic plastisphere. Correspondingly, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism were the dominant pathways expressed. Quorum sensing and toxin-associated proteins of Streptomyces were indicative of inter-community interactions. Stress response proteins expressed by Psychrobacter, Planococcus, and Pseudoalteromonas and proteins mediating xenobiotics degradation in Psychrobacter and Pseudoalteromonas suggested phenotypic adaptations to the toxic chemical microenvironment of the plastisphere. Interestingly, a targeted search strategy identified plastic biodegradation enzymes, including polyamidase, hydrolase, and depolymerase, expressed by rare taxa. The expression of virulence factors and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance suggested pathogenic genera were active, despite representing a minor component of the plastisphere community.ConclusionOur study addresses a critical gap in understanding the functioning of the marine plastisphere, contributing new insights into the function and ecology of an emerging and important microbial niche. Our comprehensive multi-omics and comparative metaproteomics experimental design enhances biological interpretations to provide new perspectives on microorganisms of potential biotechnological significance beyond biodegradation and to improve the assessment of the risks associated with microorganisms colonizing marine plastic pollution.EMsdtEfK7hXyizwjh4GBBGVideo AbstractConclusionOur study addresses a critical gap in understanding the functioning of the marine plastisphere, contributing new insights into the function and ecology of an emerging and important microbial niche.

Emerging Concepts Of Hybrid Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition In Cancer Progression,"Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process through which epithelial (E) cells lose their adherens junctions, transform into mesenchymal (M) cells and attain motility, leading to metastasis at distant organs. Nowadays, the concept of EMT has shifted from a binary phase of interconversion of pure E to M cells and vice versa to a spectrum of E/M transition states preferably coined as hybrid/partial/intermediate EMT. Hybrid EMT, being a plastic transient state, harbours cells which co-express both E and M markers and exhibit high tumourigenic properties, leading to stemness, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Several preclinical and clinical studies provided the evidence of co-existence of E/M phenotypes. Regulators including transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and phenotypic stability factors (PSFs) help in maintaining the hybrid state. Computational and bioinformatics approaches may be excellent for identifying new factors or combinations of regulatory elements that govern the different EMT transition states. Therapeutic intervention against hybrid E/M cells, though few, may evolve as a rational strategy against metastasis and drug resistance. This review has attempted to present the recent advancements on the concept and regulation of the process of hybrid EMT which generates hybrid E/M phenotypes, evidence of intermediate EMT in both preclinical and clinical setup, impact of partial EMT on promoting tumourigenesis, and future strategies which might be adapted to tackle this phenomenon.","Sinha, D; Saha, P; Samanta, A; Bishayee, A",10.3390/biom10111561,Biomolecules
Sox2 As A Novel Contributor Of Oxidative Metabolism In Melanoma Cells,"BackgroundDeregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and recent evidence underlines that targeting tumor energetics may improve therapy response and patient outcome. Despite the general attitude of cancer cells to exploit the glycolytic pathway even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect), tumor metabolism is extremely plastic, and such ability to switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) allows cancer cells to survive under hostile microenvironments. Recently, OxPhos has been related with malignant progression, chemo-resistance and metastasis. OxPhos is induced under extracellular acidosis, a well-known characteristic of most solid tumors, included melanoma.MethodsTo evaluate whether SOX2 modulation is correlated with metabolic changes under standard or acidic conditions, SOX2 was silenced and overexpressed in several melanoma cell lines. To demonstrate that SOX2 directly represses HIF1A expression we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assay.ResultsIn A375-M6 melanoma cells, extracellular acidosis increases SOX2 expression, that sustains the oxidative cancer metabolism exploited under acidic conditions. By studying non-acidic SSM2c and 501-Mel melanoma cells (high- and very low-SOX2 expressing cells, respectively), we confirmed the metabolic role of SOX2, attributing SOX2-driven OxPhos reprogramming to HIF1 pathway disruption.ConclusionsSOX2 contributes to the acquisition of an aggressive oxidative tumor phenotype, endowed with enhanced drug resistance and metastatic ability.","Andreucci, E; Pietrobono, S; Peppicelli, S; Ruzzolini, J; Bianchini, F; Biagioni, A; Stecca, B; Calorini, L",10.1186/s12964-018-0297-z,Cell Communication And Signaling
Three-Dimensional In Vitro Cell Culture Models In Drug Discovery And Drug Repositioning,"Drug development is a lengthy and costly process that proceeds through several stages from target identification to lead discovery and optimization, preclinical validation and clinical trials culminating in approval for clinical use. An important step in this process is high-throughput screening (HIS) of small compound libraries for lead identification. Currently, the majority of cell-based HIS is being carried out on cultured cells propagated in two-dimensions (2D) on plastic surfaces optimized for tissue culture. At the same time, compelling evidence suggests that cells cultured in these non physiological conditions are not representative of cells residing in the complex microenvironment of a tissue. This discrepancy is thought to be a significant contributor to the high failure rate in drug discovery, where only a low percentage of drugs investigated ever make it through the gamut of testing and approval to the market. Thus, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture technologies that more closely resemble in vivo cell environments are now being pursued with intensity as they are expected to accommodate better precision in drug discovery. Here we will review common approaches to 3D culture, discuss the significance of 3D cultures in drug resistance and drug repositioning and address some of the challenges of applying 3D cell cultures to high -throughput drug discovery.","Langhans, Sa",10.3389/fphar.2018.00006,Frontiers In Pharmacology
"Reliable And Reusable Whole Polypropylene Plastic Microfluidic Devices For A Rapid, Low-Cost Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test","Using an antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) as an example, this work demonstrates a practical method to fabricate microfluidic chips entirely from polypropylene (PP) and the benefits for potential commercial use. Primarily caused by the misuse and abuse of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to modern medicine. The AST is a promising technique to help with the optimal use of antibiotics for reducing AMR. However, current phenotypic ASTs suffer from long turnaround time, while genotypic ASTs suffer from low reliability, and both are unaffordable for routine use. New microfluidics based AST methods are rapid but still unreliable as well as costly due to the PDMS chip material. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient method to fabricate whole PP microfluidic chips with high resolution and fidelity. Unlike PDMS chips, the whole PP chips showed better reliability due to their inertness; they are solvent-compatible and can be conveniently reused and recycled, which largely decreases the cost, and are environmentally friendly. We specially designed 3D chambers that allow for quick cell loading without valving/liquid exchange; this new hydrodynamic design satisfies the shear stress requirement for on-chip bacterial culture, which, compared to reported designs for similar purposes, allows for a simpler, more rapid, and high-throughput operation. Our system allows for reliable tracking of individual cells and acquisition of AST results within 1-3 hours, which is among the group of fastest phenotypic methods. The PP chips are more reliable and affordable than PDMS chips, providing a practical solution to improve current culture-based AST and benefiting the fight against AMR through helping doctors prescribe effective, narrow-spectrum antibiotics; they will also be broadly useful for other applications wherein a reliable, solvent-resistant, anti-fouling, and affordable microfluidic chip is needed.","Sun, H; Chan, Cw; Wang, Ys; Yao, X; Mu, X; Lu, Xd; Zhou, Jh; Cai, Zw; Ren, Kn",10.1039/c9lc00502a,Lab On A Chip
Assessing Microplastics-Antibiotics Coexistence Induced Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa At A Water Region Scale,"Microplastics (MPs) waste is widespread globally in water systems. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause serious acute and chronic infections that are notoriously difficult to treat. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is broadly applied as an anti-P. aeruginosa drug. A growing evidence reveals that antibioticresistance genes-carrying Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected on MPs forming plastisphere due to their adsorbability along with high occurrence of CIP in water environments. The MPs-niched CIP-resistant P. aeruginosa has been likely to emerge as an unignorable public health issue. Here, we offered a novel approach to assess the development of CIP-resistant P. aeruginosa under MPs-antibiotic coexistence at a water region scale. By combing the adsorption isotherm models used to estimate CIP condensation around MPs and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-based microbial population dynamic model, we predicted the P. aeruginosa development on CIP-adsorbed MPs in waters. Our assessment revealed a high antibiotic resistance in the P. aeruginosa populations (-50 %) with a wider range of waterborne total cell counts (-10- 2-104 cfu mL-1) among water regions in that the resistance proportion was primarily determined by CIP pollution level and relative abundance of various polymer type of MPs. We implicate that water region-specific MPs were highly likely to provide media for P. aeruginosa propagation. Our results highlight the importance of antibiotic-resistant pathogen colonization-emerging environmental medium interactions when addressing global threat from MPs pollution, in the context of MPs-antibiotics co-contamination assessment and for the continued provision of water system management.","Wang, Wm; Lu, Th; Chen, Cy; Liao, Cm",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121721,Water Research
"Prevalence Of Pharmaceuticals And Personal Care Products, Microplastics And Co-Infecting Microbes In The Post-Covid-19 Era And Its Implications On Antimicrobial Resistance And Potential Endocrine Disruptive Effects","personal care products (PPCPs), microplastics (MPs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and soaring coinfecting microbes, tied with potential endocrine disruptive (ED) are critical environmental concerns that requires a detailed documentation and analysis. During the pandemic, the identification, enumeration, and assessment of potential hazards of PPCPs and MPs and (used as anti-COVID-19 agents/applications) in aquatic habitats have been attempted globally. Albeit receding threats in the magnitude of COVID-19 infections, both these pollutants have still posed serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the very health and hygiene of the population in the vicinity. The surge in the contaminants post-COVID also renders them to be potent vectors to harbor and amplify AMR. Pertinently, the present work attempts to critically review such instances to understand the underlying mechanism, interactions swaying the current health of our environment during this post-COVID-19 era. During this juncture, although prevention of diseases, patient care, and self-hygiene have taken precedence, nevertheless antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts have been overlooked. Unnecessary usage of PPCPs and plastics during the pandemic has resulted in increased emerging contaminants (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients and MPs) in various environmental matrices. It was also noticed that among COVID-19 patients, while the bacterial co-infection prevalence was 0.2-51%, the fungi, viral, protozoan and helminth were 0.3-49, 1-22, 2-15, 0.4-15% respectively, rendering them resistant to residual PPCPs. There are inevitable chances of ED effects from PPCPs and MPs applied previously, that could pose far-reaching health concerns. Furthermore, clinical and other experimental evidence for many newer compounds is very scarce and demands further research. Pro-active measures targeting effective waste management, evolved environmental policies aiding strict regulatory measures, and scientific research would be crucial in minimizing the impact and creating better preparedness towards such events among the masses fostering sustainability.","Kumar, M; Mazumder, P; Silori, R; Manna, S; Panday, Dp; Das, N; Sethy, Sk; Kuroda, K; Mahapatra, Dm; Mahlknecht, J; Tyagi, Vk; Singh, R; Zang, J; Barceló, D",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166419,Science Of The Total Environment
Improved Prediction Of Bacterial Genotype-Phenotype Associations Using Interpretable Pangenome-Spanning Regressions,"Discovery of genetic variants underlying bacterial phenotypes and the prediction of phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance are fundamental tasks in bacterial genomics. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods have been applied to study these relations, but the plastic nature of bacterial genomes and the clonal structure of bacterial populations creates challenges. We introduce an alignment-free method which finds sets of loci associated with bacterial phenotypes, quantifies the total effect of genetics on the phenotype, and allows accurate phenotype prediction, all within a single computationally scalable joint modeling framework. Genetic variants covering the entire pangenome are compactly represented by extended DNA sequence words known as unitigs, and model fitting is achieved using elastic net penalization, an extension of standard multiple regression. Using an extensive set of state-of-the-art bacterial population genomic data sets, we demonstrate that our approach performs accurate phenotype prediction, comparable to popular machine learning methods, while retaining both interpretability and computational efficiency. Compared to those of previous approaches, which test each genotype-phenotype association separately for each variant and apply a significance threshold, the variants selected by our joint modeling approach overlap substantially. IMPORTANCE Being able to identify the genetic variants responsible for specific bacterial phenotypes has been the goal of bacterial genetics since its inception and is fundamental to our current level of understanding of bacteria. This identification has been based primarily on painstaking experimentation, but the availability of large data sets of whole genomes with associated phenotype metadata promises to revolutionize this approach, not least for important clinical phenotypes that are not amenable to laboratory analysis. These models of phenotype-genotype association can in the future be used for rapid prediction of clinically important phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance and virulence by rapid-turnaround or point-of-care tests. However, despite much effort being put into adapting genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches to cope with bacterium-specific problems, such as strong population structure and horizontal gene exchange, current approaches are not yet optimal. We describe a method that advances methodology for both association and generation of portable prediction models.","Lees, Ja; Mai, Tt; Galardini, M; Wheeler, Ne; Horsfield, St; Parkhill, J; Corander, J",10.1128/mBio.01344-20,Mbio
How The Interplay Among The Tumor Microenvironment And The Gut Microbiota Influences The Stemness Of Colorectal Cancer Cells,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent cancer disease and involves a multi-step process in which intestinal cells acquire malignant characteristics. It is well established that the appearance of distal metastasis in CRC patients is the cause of a poor prognosis and treatment failure. Nevertheless, in the last decades, CRC aggressiveness and progression have been attributed to a specific cell population called CRC stem cells (CCSC) with features like tumor initiation capacity, self-renewal capacity, and acquired multidrug resistance. Emerging data highlight the concept of this cell subtype as a plastic entity that has a dynamic status and can be originated from different types of cells through genetic and epigenetic changes. These alterations are modulated by complex and dynamic crosstalk with environmental factors by paracrine signaling. It is known that in the tumor niche, different cell types, structures, and biomolecules coexist and interact with cancer cells favoring cancer growth and development. Together, these components constitute the tumor microenvironment (TME). Most recently, researchers have also deepened the influence of the complex variety of microorganisms that inhabit the intestinal mucosa, collectively known as gut microbiota, on CRC. Both TME and microorganisms participate in inflammatory processes that can drive the initiation and evolution of CRC. Since in the last decade, crucial advances have been made concerning to the synergistic interaction among the TME and gut microorganisms that condition the identity of CCSC, the data exposed in this review could provide valuable insights into the biology of CRC and the development of new targeted therapies.","Díaz, Mbn; Carriere, P; Gentili, C",10.4252/wjsc.v15.i5.281,World Journal Of Stem Cells
Early Biofilm And Streamer Formation Is Mediated By Wall Shear Stress And Surface Wettability: A Multifactorial Microfluidic Study,"Biofilms are intricate communities of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-produced matrix of extra-polymeric substances (EPS), creating complex three-dimensional structures allowing for liquid and nutrient transport through them. These aggregations offer constituent microorganisms enhanced protection from environmental stimuli-like fluid flow-and are also associated with higher resistance to antimicrobial compounds, providing a persistent cause of concern in numerous sectors like the marine (biofouling and aquaculture), medical (infections and antimicrobial resistance), dentistry (plaque on teeth), food safety, as well as causing energy loss and corrosion. Recent studies have demonstrated that biofilms interact with microplastics, often influencing their pathway to higher trophic levels. Previous research has shown that initial bacterial attachment is affected by surface properties. Using a microfluidic flow cell, we have investigated the relationship between both wall shear stress (tau(w)) and surface properties (surface wettability) upon biofilm formation of two species (Cobetia marina and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We investigated biofilm development on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) membranes, Permanox (R) slides, and glass slides, using nucleic acid staining and end-point confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that flow conditions affect biomass, maximum thickness, and surface area of biofilms, with higher tau(w) (5.6 Pa) resulting in thinner biofilms than lower tau(w) (0.2 Pa). In addition, we observed differences in biofilm development across the surfaces tested, with LDPE typically demonstrating more overall biofilm in comparison to Permanox (R) and glass. Moreover, we demonstrate the formation of biofilm streamers under laminar flow conditions within straight micro-channels.","Chun, Alm; Mosayyebi, A; Butt, A; Carugo, D; Salta, M",10.1002/mbo3.1310,Microbiologyopen
Short- And Long-Term Single And Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Chromium On The Freshwater Water Flea Daphnia Magna,"In this study, we investigated the individual and combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and chromium (Cr) on the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna by measuring mortality, bioaccumulation, antioxidative response, multixenobiotic resistance activity, and sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis in short-term assays and in vivo endpoints including reproduction and adult survival rate in long-term assays. Exposure to MPs, Cr, and their combination caused significant deleterious effects and acute toxicity in D. magna. Alterations in oxidative stress occurred in the groups treated with MPs and Cr alone and together. However, upon co-exposure to MPs, the Cr concentration, measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, decreased, suggesting that MPs and Cr interact with each other. Based on enzymatic activities, we noted a decrease in MP egestion via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity in the MP-exposed groups, and multidrug resistance-associated protein activity increased in some of the MP-exposed animals depending on Cr concentration. On the other hand, MP exposure seemed to lead to mitochondrial transcription dysfunction induced by Cr via sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, these results indicate that co-exposure to MPs and Cr causes acute toxicity in D. magna but lacks the chronic toxicity (21 days) and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Cr exposure alone.","Jeong, H; Lee, Yh; Sayed, Aeh; Jeong, Cb; Zhou, Bs; Lee, Js; Byeon, E",10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106348,Aquatic Toxicology
Toll-Like Receptor 4 Agonistic Antibody Promotes Host Defense Against Chronic Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Lung Infection In Mice,"Chronic lower respiratory tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is difficult to treat due to enhanced antibiotic resistance and decreased efficacy of drug delivery to destroyed lung tissue. To determine the potential for restorative immunomodulation therapies, we evaluated the effect of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation on the host immune response to Pseudomonas infection in mice. We implanted sterile plastic tubes precoated with P. aeruginosa in the bronchi of mice, administered the TLR4/MD2 agonistic monoclonal antibody UT12 intraperitoneally every week, and subsequently analyzed the numbers of viable bacteria and inflammatory cells and the levels of cytokines. We also performed flow cytometry-based phagocytosis and opsonophagocytic killing assays in vitro using UT12-treated murine peritoneal neutrophils. UT12-treated mice showed significantly enhanced bacterial clearance, increased numbers of Ly6G(+) neutrophils, and increased concentrations of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) in the lungs (P< 0.05). Depletion of CD4(+) T cells eliminated the ability of the UT12 treatment to improve bacterial clearance and promote neutrophil recruitment and MIP-2 production. Additionally, UT12-pretreated peritoneal neutrophils exhibited increased opsonophagocytic killing activity via activation of the serine protease pathway, specifically neutrophil elastase activity, in a TLR4-dependent manner. These data indicated that UT12 administration significantly augmented the innate immune response against chronic bacterial infection, in part by promoting neutrophil recruitment and bactericidal function.","Nakamura, S; Iwanaga, N; Seki, M; Fukudome, K; Oshima, K; Miyazaki, T; Izumikawa, K; Yanagihara, K; Miyazaki, Y; Mukae, H; Kohno, S",10.1128/IAI.01384-15,Infection And Immunity
Genome-Wide Dna Methylome Analysis Identifies Methylation Signatures Associated With Survival And Drug Resistance Of Ovarian Cancers,"Background: In contrast to stable genetic events, epigenetic changes are highly plastic and play crucial roles in tumor evolution and development. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly heterogeneous disease that is generally associated with poor prognosis and treatment failure. Profiling epigenome-wide DNA methylation status is therefore essential to better characterize the impact of epigenetic alterations on the heterogeneity of EOC. Methods: An epigenome-wide association study was conducted to evaluate global DNA methylation in a retrospective cohort of 80 mixed subtypes of primary ovarian cancers and 30 patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Three demethylating agents, azacytidine, decitabine, and thioguanine, were tested their anti-cancer and anti-chemoresistant effects on HGSOC cells. Results: Global DNA hypermethylation was significantly associated with high-grade tumors, platinum resistance, and poor prognosis. We determined that 9313 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were enriched in their relative gene regions of 4938 genes involved in small GTPases and were significantly correlated with the PI3K-AKT, MAPK, RAS, and WNT oncogenic pathways. On the other hand, global DNA hypermethylation was preferentially associated with recurrent HGSOC. A total of 2969 DMPs corresponding to 1471 genes were involved in olfactory transduction, and calcium and cAMP signaling. Co-treatment with demethylating agents showed significant growth retardation in ovarian cancer cells through differential inductions, such as cell apoptosis by azacytidine or G2/M cell cycle arrest by decitabine and thioguanine. Notably, azacytidine and decitabine, though not thioguanine, synergistically enhanced cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity in HGSOC cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the significant association of global hypermethylation with poor prognosis and drug resistance in high-grade EOC and highlights the potential of demethylating agents in cancer treatment.","Chan, Dw; Lam, Wy; Chen, Fs; Yung, Mmh; Chan, Ys; Chan, Ws; He, Ff; Liu, Sis; Chan, Kkl; Li, B; Ngan, Hys",10.1186/s13148-021-01130-5,Clinical Epigenetics
Antimicrobial Activity Of Metal Oxide Microspheres: An Innovative Process For Homogeneous Incorporation Into Materials,"AimsTo investigate the potent control of microbial surface contamination of an innovative process which consists in incorporating metal oxide microspheres homogeneously into materials. Methods and ResultsSpherical microspheres containing zinc and magnesium oxides synthesized via a one-step manufacturing process (Pyrolyse Pulverisee((R))) and incorporated into different plastic matrices were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity according to JIS Z 2801 standard. A significant activity was observed for microsphere-added polyethylene coupons with a reduction of all tested bacteria populations, including Gram negative and Gram positive even expressing acquired antibiotic resistance (Escherichia coli ESBL, Staphylococcus aureus metiR). An antiviral activity higher than 2 log of reduction was also observed on H1N1 and HSV-1 viruses. This antimicrobial effect was dose-dependent and time-dependent for both polyethylene and polypropylene matrices. Antimicrobial activity was maintained after exposition to disinfectants and totally preserved 50months after the preparation of the coupons. ConclusionsIncorporated into plastic matrices, metal oxide microspheres showed significant antibacterial and antiviral activities. Significance and Impact of StudyThis is, to our knowledge, the first report on an original process incorporating metal oxide microspheres, which have specific physico-chemical and antimicrobial properties, into materials that could be used for surface contamination prevention.","Feuillolay, C; Haddioui, L; Verelst, M; Furiga, A; Marchin, L; Roques, C",10.1111/jam.13752,Journal Of Applied Microbiology
Ecological Insights Into The Resilience Of Marine Plastisphere Throughout A Storm Disturbance,"Among numerous research about marine plastisphere, the community living on the surface of plastic debris, little attention was given to the ecological mechanisms governing prokaryotes compared to eukaryotes, and even less focused on their resilience in a changing climate with more storm prevalence. Our current research recruited an integrated approach involving community succession across temporal dimension, ecological mechanisms that govern the assembly, and resilience to environmental perturbations to highlight the ecology of different kingdoms in the plastisphere. Towards this goal, we examined the succession of the prokaryotic and cukaryotic communities on artificial plastic nets in a sidestream of seawater from the Gulf of Aqaba over 35 days. A robust local storm enabled investigation of the alterations before, during, and after this disturbance, aiming at the community's potential to recover. Data from 165 and 18S rRNA sequencing and microscopic analyses decrypted the plastisphere diversity, community assembly, and stochasticity, followed by further analyses of functional and co-occurrence networks for the prokaryotic group. Prokaryotic and cukaryotic communities underwent exact opposite ecological mechanisms. While determinism driven by a robust environmental selection dictated the prokaryotic community assembly, stochasticity prevailed when this condition was relaxed. Interestingly, resilience against disturbance was observed in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes. 'the decrease in compositional, functional diversity and network complexity in the prokaryotic community was reversed, presumably due to the niche specification process and high dispersal. Niche specification following perturbation was evident in some bacteria by selected functions associated with plastic degradation, stress response, and antibiotic resistance. On the contrary, eukaryotes decreased in diversity and were dominated by the commonly found Chiorophyta towards the later successional period. Novel findings on the ecology of marine plastisphere during perturbation encourage the integration of this aspect into prediction research.","Nguyen, D; Masasa, M; Ovadia, O; Guttman, L",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159775,Science Of The Total Environment
Evidence From In Vitro And In Vivo Studies On The Potential Health Repercussions Of Micro- And Nanoplastics,"Plastic is a synthetic or semisynthetic polymer with numerous physicochemical properties, and its fragmentation can give rise to microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). These particles can enter our ecosystem, where a process of constant degradation facilitates their dispersion and absorption by different species, affecting multiple organs and systems. The objective of this review was to provide an update on the potential health effects of MPs and NPs indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies have described the absorption of plastic particles of different sizes and have documented their proinflammatory effects and genotoxicity, which can lead to the structural alteration of cells. MPs and NPs have also been implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MPs and NPs can access organisms via dietary and respiratory pathways and through the epidermis. Their reported effects include: changes in microbiota and digestive enzyme production; inflammatory processes at respiratory level; circulatory and reproductive system disorders; and neurotoxicity, inducing behavioral changes. In vitro and in vivo studies have evidenced detrimental effects in different organs and systems as a function of the dose, size, and chemical properties of plastic particles. Further research is warranted to determine the effects on human health of these particles at environmental doses.","González-Acedo, A; García-Recio, E; Illescas-Montes, R; Ramos-Torrecillas, J; Melguizo-Rodríguez, L; Costela-Ruiz, Vj",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130826,Chemosphere
Secondary Metabolites From Food-Derived Yeasts Inhibit Virulence Of Candida Albicans,"A sparse number of available antifungal drugs, therapeutic side effects, and drug resistance are major challenges in current antifungal therapy to treat Candida albicans-associated infections. Here, we describe two food-derived yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatchenkia occidentalis, that inhibit virulence traits of C. albicans, including hyphal morphogenesis, biofilm formation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. These yeasts also protect the model host Caenorhabditis elegans from C. albicans infection. We demonstrate that the protective activity is primarily retained in the secretome of the beneficial yeasts, and the protection they provide as a physical barrier is negligible. S. cerevisiae aro8 aro9 mutant analysis demonstrate that phenylethanol and tryptophol are necessary for protection, and experiments with commercially procured compounds indicate that they are sufficient to inhibit C. albicans virulence. We propose food-derived yeasts as an alternative or combination therapy to conventional antifungal therapy for C. albicans infection. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome, primarily established by food, is complex and contributes to the health of the host. Molecular mechanisms that regulate microbial interactions and host health remain unclear. Here, we show that the pathogen C. albicans interacts with food-derived beneficial yeasts in the gut of the microscopic worm, C. elegans, forming a simple microbiome. C. albicans can colonize the worm gut, compromising the worm's health, and exposure to the food-derived yeasts ameliorates this effect protecting the nematode host. We identify small molecules from food-derived yeasts that are necessary and sufficient to inhibit multiple virulence traits of C. albicans and protect the nematode host. The nematode gut faithfully recapitulates a mammalian intestine. This could be an effective alternative or combination therapy for C. albicans infection.","Kunyeit, L; Kurrey, Nk; Anu-Appaiah, Ka; Rao, Rp",10.1128/mBio.01891-21,Mbio
Antibiofilm And Repair Activity Of Ozonated Oil In Liposome,"The use of medical devices, such as contact lenses, represents a substantial risk of infection, as they can act as scaffolds for formation of microbial biofilms. Recently, the increasing emergency of antibiotic resistance has prompted the development of novel and effective antimicrobial drugs for biofilm treatment, such as oxidizing agents. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Ozodrop (R) and Ozodrop (R) gel, commercial names of ozonated oil in liposomes plus hypromellose, on eradication and de novo formation of biofilms on different supports, such as plastic plates and contact lens. Our results demonstrate that ozonated liposomal sunflower oil plus hypromellose have an excellent inhibitory effect on bacterial viability and on both de novo formation and eradication of biofilms produced on plates and contact lens by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, we show that Ozodrop (R) formulations stimulate expression of antimicrobial peptides and that Ozodrop (R) gel has a strong repair activity on human epithelial cells, suggesting further applications for the treatment of non-healing infected wounds.","Zerillo, L; Polvere, I; Varricchio, R; Madera, Jr; D'Andrea, S; Voccola, S; Franchini, I; Stilo, R; Vito, P; Zotti, T",10.1111/1751-7915.13949,Microbial Biotechnology
Comparison Of Long-Read Sequencing Technologies In The Hybrid Assembly Of Complex Bacterial Genomes,"Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (<300 bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long-read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods affect hybrid assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures, and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies, as well as comparing to long-read-only assembly with Flye followed by short-read polishing with Pilon. Hybrid assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction, and was superior to the long-read assembly and polishing approach evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.","De Maio, N; Shaw, Lp; Hubbard, A; George, S; Sanderson, Nd; Swann, J; Wick, R; Abuoun, M; Stubberfield, E; Hoosdally, Sj; Crook, Dw; Peto, Tea; Sheppard, Ae; Bailey, Mj; Read, Ds; Anjum, Mf; Walker, As; Stoesser, N; Brett, H; Bowes, M; Chau, K; Duggett, N; Gilson, D; Gweon, Hs; Floosdally, S; Kavanaugh, J; Jones, H; Sebra, R; Smith, R; Swann, J; Woodford, N",10.1099/mgen.0.000294,Microbial Genomics
"The Role Of Tumor Associated Macrophages (Tams) In Cancer Pro-Gression, Chemoresistance, Angiogenesis And Metastasis-Current Status","Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), located in the tumor microenvironment (TME), play a significant role in cancer cell survival and progression. TAMs have been involved in producing immuno-suppressive TME in the tumor by generating inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, etc. TAMs can influence the angiogenesis, metastatic behavior of tumor cells (TCs) and cause multidrug resistance. TAMs within the TME can enhance cancer cell metastasis and are stromal and perivascular. The angiogenesis is promoted at the hypoxia, and the avascular zones of TME. Differentiation states of TAMs are considered 'plastic' as they exhibit temporal expression of one or several phenotypes depending on local cues. Emerging cancer research depicted the epigenetic regulation of macrophage polarization (both M1s, M2s) and their potential implications to develop pharmacologic modulators and microRNAs to act as molecular switches and even to serve as targeted therapies to inhibit tumor growth. In the present article, the role of TAMs in tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis was discussed. In addition, key signaling cascades regulated by TAMs, which have a role in chemoresistance, were also discussed. Currently, novel pleiotropic properties of various anticancer phytomedicines are gaining importance as they assist in overcoming TAMs-induced chemoresistance. Moreover, these phytomedicines are being tested as 'adjunct therapeutics' along with chemotherapeutic agents, anti-angiogenic molecules, anti-metastatic compounds, and other immune-checkpoint blockers against tumor metastasis/angiogenesis. Hence, a brief note on natural products targeting TAMs was provided. In summary, this review would benefit pharmacologists and medical professionals to develop therapies to scriptomics, and proteomics.","Dallavalasa, S; Beeraka, Nm; Basavaraju, Cg; Tulimilli, S; Sadhu, Sp; Rajesh, K; Aliev, G; Madhunapantula, S",10.2174/0929867328666210720143721,Current Medicinal Chemistry
Size-Dependent Toxic Interaction Between Polystyrene Beads And Mercury On The Mercury Accumulation And Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Of Brackish Water Flea Diaphanosoma Celebensis,"Due to their worldwide distribution and persistence, mercury (Hg), and nano- and microplastics (NMPs) pose major threats to global ocean ecosystems. Hg and NMPs co-exist in the ocean and can interact with each other. However, information on the toxicity of this interaction to marine biota remains limited. Thus, we investigated the toxicological interaction between HgCl2 2 (Hg) and NMPs by studying the influence of different sizes of polystyrene beads (0.05-, 0.5-, and 6-mu m) on Hg accumulation in the brackish water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis. . The Hg adsorption capacity of NPs (0.05-mu m) was higher than that of MPs (0.5- and 6-mu m). Only the group co- exposed to both Hg and NPs showed increased Hg content in D. celebensis. . Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and transcriptional modulation of transporter genes ( ABCBs and ABCCs) ) were decreased by NMP exposure, particularly by NPs, suggesting MXR disruption by NPs. However, only the activity of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs; ABCCs) increased with Hg exposure and decreased upon NP+Hg +Hg co- exposure, indicating an important role of ABCC in Hg efflux. Furthermore, in vivo toxicity tests showed a synergistic toxic interaction between Hg and NPs on the reproduction of D . celebensis. . Our findings suggest that NPs have the potential to enhance the toxicity of Hg, increasing Hg accumulation not only by serving Hg as a carrier but also by disrupting MXR.","Yoo, Jw; Lee, Yh; Kim, J; Han, S; Lee, Kw; Lee, Ym",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117131,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
A Monoclonal Antibody Against Β1 Integrin Inhibits Proliferation And Increases Survival In An Orthotopic Model Of High-Grade Meningioma,"Background High-grade meningiomas (HGMs; World Health Organization [WHO] classification grade II and III) have high relapse rates and poor clinical outcomes despite surgery and radiation treatments. No effective medical therapy currently exists for HGMs, and developing novel therapeutic strategies depends on the identification of molecular drivers. In cancer, beta 1 integrin enhances malignant characteristics, including proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Objective We conducted this study to investigate whether beta 1 integrin could be a therapeutic target in HGMs. Patients and Methods Expression of beta 1 integrin was examined in gene array datasets, with proteomics of clinical meningioma specimens, and in patient-derived HGM xenografts. Anti-tumor activity of OS2966, a first-in-class humanized antagonizing monoclonal antibody against beta 1 integrin, was tested in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of patient-derived malignant meningioma. Results beta 1 integrin was expressed in meningiomas of all WHO grades and two xenografts tested. In vitro, OS2966 suppressed the viability of NF2-deficient MN3 sphere cells and NF2-wild-type IOMM-Lee malignant meningioma cells only when plated on laminin-coated plastic. While OS2966 decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both MN3 cells and laminin-grown IOMM-Lee cells, OS2966 only affected the phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397) in MN3, and of Akt (Ser473) in IOMM-Lee cells, respectively, indicating differential pathway inhibition. Systemic administration of OS2966 in mice bearing orthotopic MN3 HGMs inhibited HGM cell proliferation and significantly extended overall survival of the treated mice. Conclusions beta 1 Integrin may be a therapeutic target in HGMs, and further preclinical and clinical development of OS2966 for HGM therapy is warranted.","Nigim, F; Kiyokawa, J; Gurtner, A; Kawamura, Y; Hua, Ly; Kasper, Em; Brastianos, Pk; Cahill, Dp; Rabkin, Sd; Martuza, Rl; Carbonell, Ws; Wakimoto, H",10.1007/s11523-019-00654-4,Targeted Oncology
The Effect Of Sport And Physical Activity On Transport Proteins: Implications For Cancer Prevention And Control,"The present contribution briefly overviews the major biological functions of the plasma membrane and of the transport proteins (transporters), which enable the movement of different molecules and substrates (either charged or uncharged) by passive (facilitated diffusion) or active transport. In particular, transporters are overviewed at the level of the skeletal muscles, which represent a highly complex, heterogeneous, plastic and dynamic tissue and are one of the most abundant tissues in humans, accounting for up to 40% of their total weight and containing up to 50%-75% of all body proteins. Moreover, it is shown how sport and physical activity finely tune and modulate human proteome, especially in terms of structural and functional improvements concerning the density of the transport proteins. These changes are among the factors responsible for the positive outcomes of training, which involve mainly the cardiovascular and the endocrine/metabolic systems. Different kinds of training (strength and endurance) enable to achieve such improvements, even though there seems to exist a dose-relationship intensity-dependent effect, with responses after 6-8 weeks of exercise and disappearing in the chronic period (years of training). Finally, exercise-induced changes at the level of transporters can play a role in terms of cancer prevention and management. Regular physical activity and exercise can, indeed, counteract the side-effects of chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin and other anthracycline derivatives, which may impair the functions of cardiac and skeletal muscles, probably modulating the expression of multidrug resistance proteins.","Sellami, M; Bragazzi, Nl",10.1016/bs.apcsb.2020.07.001,"Advances In Protein Chemistry And Structural Biology, Vol 123: Transport Proteins"
Bacteriological Investigation And Drug Resistance Analysis Of Chronic Refractory Wound Secretions,"Background: Chronic refractory wounds were common and the treatments were complicated for burn and plastic surgeons. This study was to investigate the bacterial distribution characteristics and bacterial drug resistance of chronic refractory wound secretions. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 425 patients with chronic refractory wound infection. The results of bacterial culture of wound secretions and drug sensitivity test were retrospectively analyzed. Further, the location area of the wound was divided into 4 regions, and the difference of the bacterial culture results between different regions was analyzed. Results: The wound secretions were cultured into 401 bacterial strains, including 206 gram-positive bacteria strains, accounting for 51.4%, with the highest detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus at 26.2% (105/401). There were 195 gram-negative bacteria strains, accounting for 48.6%, with the highest detection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 14.2% (57/401). There were 6 fungal strains. The proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the III region of the wound zone was significantly greater than that in the other 3 regions. Conclusions: The detection rate of gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria of chronic refractory wound secretions is not much different. However, in the area close to the perineum (III region), gram-negative bacteria is significantly higher, which has a certain reference value for the use of antibiotics in clinical practice.","Dong, Xm; Pei, Ll; Lu, Ps; Ni, P; Yu, Bf; Fan, Zq",10.1097/SCS.0000000000008473,Journal Of Craniofacial Surgery
"Multidrug-Resistant Pattern Of Food Borne Illness Associated Bacteria Isolated From Cockroaches In Meal Serving Facilities, Jimma, Ethiopia","Introduction: An increase in the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in recent years is becoming worrisome. Domestic cockroaches can play a significant role in the dissemination of such bacteria between the environment and human beings. This study aimed at determining anti-microbial resistance pattern of food borne illness associated bacteria identified from cockroaches trapped in restaurants and cafeterias. Methods: Trapped cockroaches were picked with surgical gloves, sealed in sterile plastic bags and transported to the Microbiology laboratory. Standard microbiological techniques were used to isolate and identify bacteria. Anti-microbial susceptibility testing was done using Kirby Bauer diffusion technique. Result: A total of five species of food borne illness associated bacteria were detected. Majority (57.1%) of the bacteria were isolated from the gut of cockroaches. More than 89% of the isolates were multi drug resistance (MDR). MDR was higher on gram positive bacteria. S. aureus showed 53.3% resistance against oxacillin(MRSA) and 33.3% against vancomycin. Conclusion: A very high percentage of MDR bacteria was seen in this study. Most of the bacteria tested were isolated from the gut of cockroaches. Potential factors associated with cockroaches that contributed to this high MDR rate of the isolates should be investigated in future.","Solomon, F; Kibru, G; Ali, S",10.4314/ahs.v18i1.6,African Health Sciences
Functional And Genomic Insights Into The Biotechnological Potential Of Vibrio Spp. Isolated From Deeply Polluted And Pristine Environments,"Vibrio spp. are remarkably diverse bacteria, being worthy of investigation not only for their antibiotic resistance and virulence, but also for their biotechnological potential. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that these bacteria display industrially relevant traits, particularly as producers of antimicrobial substances, tensioactive/emulsifying compounds, and enzymes. Here, our aim was to investigate the potential of Vibrio strains isolated from two different marine sources to produce such biotechnologically applicable substances. From the eighteen analyzed strains, five were isolated from plastic particles from a heavily polluted urban estuary and 13 from calcareous sponges inhabiting submarine caves in an isolated volcanic archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. Enzymatic screening revealed that most strains were agarolytic and cellulolytic. Overall, six strains showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29,213, with four of them active towards Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922 as well. Additionally, eight strains were positive for the production of bioemulsifiers. Genomic analyses of four strains further revealed insights regarding the enzymatic arsenal, as shown by the detection of several key gene clusters pertaining to the chitin degradation pathway, and also encoding diverse classes of antimicrobial-active metabolites. Our findings highlight the biotechnological potential of Vibrio spp., evidencing their functional diversity and the need for continued and sustained prospecting of this bacterial genus to uncover its potential high-value-added bioproducts.","Canellas, Alb; Marques, Mdn; Lopes, Mv; Lage, A; Klautau, M; Muricy, G; De Oliveira, Bfr; Laport, Ms",10.1007/s00284-024-04013-z,Current Microbiology
"What Should Be The Antibiotic Prescription Protocol For Burn Patients Admitted In The Department Of Burns, Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery","This is a prospective study with the aim to determine specific patterns of burn wound bacterial colonisation and antimicrobial resistance profiles. There is a high incidence of infections and septicaemia in post-burn patients, which, in turn, are associated with high morbidity and mortality, a fact that compelled us to undertake this study. The study was conducted over a period 11 months, from 1 August 2014 to 30 June 2015, in 50 burn patients admitted in our burn unit. Wound cultures were taken after 72 hours of admission from all the patients, and then, empirical systemic antibiotics were administered. For wound cultures; 1 cubic cm tissue was taken and placed in aerobic and anaerobic culture vials and transported to the microbiology lab under all aseptic precautions as soon as possible. At the time of fever any time after 72 hours of admission, 16 ml of blood was drawn under all aseptic precautions. Both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vials were filled with 8 ml of blood each and transported to the microbiology lab. The results of culture and sensitivity reports of 50 patients were recorded. The data obtained was analysed using appropriate statistical analytical tests. The most common organism responsible for bacteraemia is Pseudomonas (43%). Most of the strains of organisms isolated were resistant to commonly used antibiotics in the hospital; Pseudomonas was found 100% resistant to a combination of ampicillin + sulbactum, ceftriaxone and was most often sensitive to imipenem, amikacin and vancomycin. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was also found resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ceftriaxone, ampicillin + sulbactum and ceftazidime + calvulanic acid. Linzolid and vancomycin were effective in 83% and 100% cases, respectively. We conclude that similar institution-specific studies should be conducted, and such studies will be helpful in providing useful guidelines for choosing effective empirical therapy that will have a great impact on the prevention of infection and its complications in burn patients because of bacteraemia.","Mir, Ma; Khurram, Mf; Khan, Ah",10.1111/iwj.12588,International Wound Journal
Do Postoperative Antibiotics Affect Outcomes In Mohs Reconstructive Surgery?,"Objectives/HypothesisThe prescribing of postoperative antibiotics for patients undergoing Mohs reconstructive surgery has increased in the last decade, while antibiotic resistance has been increasing. We hypothesized that routine prescribing of postoperative antibiotics after Mohs reconstruction does not decrease the risk of surgical site infection. Study DesignRetrospective, single-institution cohort study. MethodsThis study assessed patients who underwent Mohs reconstructive surgery from January 1, 2012, to January 29, 2019. The main outcomes assessed included postoperative surgical site infections, partial or full flap/graft necrosis, hematoma, and dehiscence. ResultsA total of 900 defects in 800 patients (mean age [range] =65.3 [21-96], 54.60% female) were identified over the 7-year period. Patient-specific variables reviewed included comorbidities, age, and smoking status. Surgery-specific variables analyzed included defect characteristics, time interval between Mohs micrographic surgery and reconstruction, reconstructive modalities, and use of postoperative antibiotics. All patients received peri-incisional antibiotics. On regression analysis, use of cartilage grafts (odds ratio [OR]: 6.53; 95% CI: 2.1-20.6; P = .001), current smoking status (OR: 6.67; 95% CI: 2.09-21.30; P = .001), full-thickness defects (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-3.4; P = .045), and interpolated flap reconstruction (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0-11.5; P = .049) were associated with an increased risk of postoperative infections. Smoking and cartilage grafting remained significant on bivariable regression modeling. Use of perioperative antibiotics was not associated with a decreased risk of infection (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 0.23-14.21; P = .568). ConclusionsWe found no association between postoperative infections after Mohs reconstructive surgery and the use of postoperative antibiotics. These data support a more targeted approach to antibiotic prescribing in Mohs reconstructive surgery.

Genome Rearrangements In Escherichia Coli During De Novo Acquisition Of Resistance To A Single Antibiotic Or Two Antibiotics Successively,"BackgroundThe ability of bacteria to acquire resistance to antibiotics relies to a large extent on their capacity for genome modification. Prokaryotic genomes are highly plastic and can utilize horizontal gene transfer, point mutations, and gene deletions or amplifications to realize genome expansion and rearrangements. The contribution of point mutations to de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance is well-established. In this study, the internal genome rearrangement of Escherichia coli during to de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance was investigated using whole-genome sequencing.ResultsCells were made resistant to one of the four antibiotics and subsequently to one of the three remaining. This way the initial genetic rearrangements could be documented together with the effects of an altered genetic background on subsequent development of resistance. A DNA fragment including ampC was amplified by a factor sometimes exceeding 100 as a result of exposure to amoxicillin. Excision of prophage e14 was observed in many samples with a double exposure history, but not in cells exposed to a single antibiotic, indicating that the activation of the SOS stress response alone, normally the trigger for excision, was not sufficient to cause excision of prophage e14. Partial deletion of clpS and clpA occurred in strains exposed to enrofloxacin and tetracycline. Other deletions were observed in some strains, but not in replicates with the exact same exposure history. Various insertion sequence transpositions correlated with exposure to specific antibiotics.ConclusionsMany of the genome rearrangements have not been reported before to occur during resistance development. The observed correlation between genome rearrangements and specific antibiotic pressure, as well as their presence in independent replicates indicates that these events do not occur randomly. Taken together, the observed genome rearrangements illustrate the plasticity of the E. coli genome when exposed to antibiotic stress.","Hoeksema, M; Jonker, Mj; Bel, K; Brul, S; Ter Kuile, Bh",10.1186/s12864-018-5353-y,Bmc Genomics
Rapid Colonisation Of Environmental Plastic Waste By Pathogenic Bacteria Drives Adaptive Phenotypic Changes,"Microbial biofilms on environmental plastic pollution can serve as a reservoir for both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Associating with this 'plastisphere', provides a mechanism for the wider dissemination of pathogens within the environment and a greater potential for human exposure. For pathogens to bind to environmental plastic waste they need to be in close contact with it; therefore, understanding how rapidly pathogens can bind to plastics and the temporal colonisation dynamics of the continual cycling between the plastisphere and the environment are important factors for quantifying the persistence of human pathogens. Using simulated environmental conditions, we demonstrate that pathogenic E. coli O157 can rapidly colonise plastics (within 30 min) and persist for extended periods (at least 21 days), at concentrations sufficient to cause human infection. Importantly, repeated colonisation and dissociation cycles of E. coli O157 from the plastisphere leads to an enhanced capacity for persistence and the emergence of variants with increased virulence traits, including improved biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance. This phenotypic adaptation to repeated colonisation of environmental plastic surfaces could be selecting for more persistent and virulent strains of pathogens, and hence increase the co-pollutant risks associated with plastic pollution.","Ormsby, Mj; Woodford, L; Fellows, R; White, Hl; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136359,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
What Do We Learn From Spheroid Culture Systems? Insights From Tumorspheres Derived From Primary Colon Cancer Tissue,"Due to their self-renewal and tumorigenic properties, tumor-initiating cells (TICs) have been hypothesized to be important targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). However the study of TICs is hampered by the fact that the identification and culturing of TICs is still a subject of extensive debate. Floating three-dimensional spheroid cultures (SC) that grow in serumfree medium supplemented with growth factors are supposed to be enriched in TICs. We generated SC from fresh clinical tumor specimens and compared them to SC isolated from CRC cell-lines as well as to adherent differentiated counterparts. Patient-derived SC display self-renewal capacity and can induce serial transplantable tumors in immuno-deficient mice, which phenotypically resemble the tumor of origin. In addition, the original tumor tissue and established SC retain several similar CRC-relevant mutations. Primary SC express key stemness proteins such as SOX2, OCT4, NANOG and LGR5 and importantly show increased chemoresistance ability compared to their adherent differentiated counterparts and to cell line-derived SC. Strikingly, cells derived from spheroid or adherent differentiating culture conditions displayed similar self-renewal capacity and equally formed tumors in immune-deficient mice, suggesting that self-renewal and tumor-initiation capacity of TICs is not restricted to phenotypically immature spheroid cells, which we describe to be highly plastic and able to reacquire stem-cell traits even after long differentiation processes. Finally, we identified two genes among a sphere gene expression signature that predict disease relapse in CRC patients. Here we propose that SC derived from fresh patient tumor tissue present interesting phenotypic features that may have clinical relevance for chemoresistance and disease relapse and therefore represent a valuable tool to test for new CRC-therapies that overcome drug resistance.","Qureshi-Baig, K; Ullmann, P; Rodriguez, F; Frasquilho, S; Nazarov, Pv; Haan, S; Letellier, E",10.1371/journal.pone.0146052,Plos One
Vehicle Transmission Of Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens Mediated By Plastic Debris In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Plastic materials are emerging environmental pollutants acting as potential vehicles for accumulation and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The current study investigates the role of plastics in favoring the dispersal of specific pathogens and their associated antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). Artificial plastic substrates (APSs) were submerged in seven sampling points of Lake Bracciano (Italy), and after one -month both APSs and raw water (RW) samples were collected. Through the combination of standard microbiological and biochemical techniques, 272 bacterial strains were identified and characterized for antibiotic resistant profiling. Our results revealed a notable difference in terms of diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria recovered from APSs, compared to RW. In addition, higher resistance patterns were detected in APSs isolates, with frequent appearance of relevant ARGs and class 1 integrons. These findings reinforce the idea that plastic materials in aquatic ecosystems serve as a reservoir for superbugs, significantly contributing to the dissemination of ARGs.","Ferheen, I; Spurio, R; Marcheggiani, S",10.1016/j.isci.2024.110026,Iscience
Redox Active Zn@Mofs As Spontaneous Reactive Oxygen Species Releasing Antimicrobials,"The rapid development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among infectious pathogens has become a major threat and challenge in healthcare systems globally. A strategy distinct from minimizing the overuse of antimicrobials involves the development of novel antimicrobials with a mode of action that prevents the development of AMR microbial strains. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed as a natural byproduct of the cellular aerobic metabolism. However, it becomes pathological when ROS is produced at excessive levels. Exploiting this phenomenon, research on redox-active bactericides has been demonstrated to be beneficial. Materials that release ROS via photodynamic, thermodynamic, and photocatalytic interventions have been developed as nanomedicines and are used in various applications. However, these materials require external stimuli for ROS release to be effective as biocides. In this paper, we report novel zinc-based metal organic framework (Zn@MOF) particles that promote the spontaneous release of active ROS species. The synthesized Zn@MOF spontaneously releases superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, exhibiting a potent antimicrobial efficacy against various microbes. Zn@MOF-incorporated plastic films and coatings show excellent, long-lasting antimicrobial potency even under continuous microbial challenge and an aging process. These disinfecting surfaces maintain their antimicrobial properties even after 500x surface wipes. Zn@MOF is also biocompatible and safe on the skin, illustrating its broad potential applications in medical technology and consumer care applications.","Wang, Jq; Teong, Sp; Riduan, Sn; Armugam, A; Lu, Hf; Gao, Sj; Yean, Yk; Ying, Jy; Zhang, Yg",10.1021/jacs.3c10411,Journal Of The American Chemical Society
High Bisphenol A Concentrations Augment The Invasiveness Of Tumor Cells Through Snail-1/Cx43/Errγ-Dependent Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly present in plastics used for food storage and preservation. The release of BPA from these products results in a permanent human exposition to BPA; however, the quality and quantity of BPA adverse effects remain a matter of controversy. The common presence of BPA in the human environment and the controversies concerning the relations of human exposition to BPA and cancer incidence justify the research on the interactions between BPA and pro-metastatic signaling in cancer cells. Here, we describe a novel BPA-reactive signaling axis that induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. BPA exerted negligible effects on their properties in a wide range of concentrations (10 nM - 100 nM), whereas it considerably induced A549 invasiveness at high concentrations (10 M). The BPA-induced EMT was illustrated by morphologic changes, E/N-cadherin switch and vimentin/Snail-1/connexin(Cx)43 up-regulation in A549 populations. It was followed by enhancement of A549 drug-resistance. Corresponding effects of BPA were observed in prostate cancer cell populations. Concomitantly, we observed increased levels and perinuclear accumulation of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR gamma) in BPA-treated cells, its interactions with Cx43/Snail-1, and the corresponding effects of phenol red on A549 cells. Collectively, these data identify a novel, pro metastatic Snail-1/Cx43/ERR gamma signaling pathway. Its reactivity to BPA underlies the induction of cancer cells' invasiveness in the presence of high BPA concentrations in vitro. Thus, the chronic exposition of cancer cells to extrinsic and intrinsic BPA should be considered as a potential obstacle in a cancer therapy.","Ryszawy, D; Pudelek, M; Kochanowski, P; Janik-Olchawa, N; Bogusz, J; Rapala, M; Koczurkiewicz, P; Mikolajczyk, J; Borek, I; Kedracka-Krok, S; Karnas, E; Zuba-Surma, E; Madeja, Z; Czyz, J",10.1016/j.tiv.2019.104676,Toxicology In Vitro
Rapid And Extensive Karyotype Diversification In Haploid Clinical Candida Auris Isolates,"Candida auris is a newly emerged pathogenic microbe, having been identified as a medically relevant fungus as recently as 2009. It is one of the most drug-resistant yeast species known to date and its emergence and population structure are unusual. Because of its recent emergence, we are largely ignorant about fundamental aspects of its general biology, life cycle, and population dynamics. Here, we report the karyotype variability of 26 C. auris strains representing the four main clades. We demonstrate that all strains are haploid and have a highly plastic karyotype containing five to seven chromosomes, which can undergo marked alterations within a short time frame when the fungus is put under genotoxic, heat, or osmotic stress. No simple correlation was found between karyotype pattern, drug resistance, and clade affiliation indicating that karyotype heterogeneity is rapidly evolving. As with other Candida species, these marked karyotype differences between isolates are likely to have an important impact on pathogenic traits of C. auris.","Bravo Ruiz, G; Ross, Zk; Holmes, E; Schelenz, S; Gow, Nar; Lorenz, A",10.1007/s00294-019-00976-w,Current Genetics
Controlling The Growth Of The Skin Commensal Staphylococcus Epidermidis Using D-Alanine Auxotrophy,"Using live microbes as therapeutic candidates is a strategy that has gained traction across multiple therapeutic areas. In the skin, commensal microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining skin barrier function, homeostasis, and cutaneous immunity. Alterations of the homeostatic skin microbiome are associated with a number of skin diseases. Here, we present the design of an engineered com-mensal organism, Staphylococcus epidermidis, for use as a live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate for skin diseases. The development of novel bacterial strains whose growth can be controlled without the use of antibiotics or genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance enables modulation of therapeutic exposure and improves safety. We therefore constructed an auxotrophic strain of S. epidermidis that requires exogenously supplied D-alanine. The S. epidermidis NRRL B-4268 Delta alr1 Delta alr2 Delta dat strain (SE Delta Delta Delta) contains deletions of three biosynthetic genes: two alanine racemase genes, alr1 and alr2 (SE1674 and SE1079), and the D-alanine aminotransferase gene, dat (SE1423). These three deletions restricted growth in D-alanine-deficient medium, pooled human blood, and skin. In the presence of D-alanine, SE Delta Delta Delta colonized and increased expression of human beta-defensin 2 in cultured human skin models in vitro. SE Delta Delta Delta showed a low propensity to revert to D-alanine prototrophy and did not form biofilms on plastic in vitro. These studies support the potential safety and utility of SE Delta Delta Delta as a live biotherapeutic strain whose growth can be controlled by D-alanine. IMPORTANCE The skin microbiome is rich in opportunities for novel therapeutics for skin diseases, and synthetic biology offers the advantage of providing novel functionality or therapeutic benefit to live biotherapeutic products. The development of novel bacterial strains whose growth can be controlled without the use of antibiotics or genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance enables modulation of therapeutic exposure and improves safety. This study presents the design and in vitro evidence of a skin commensal whose growth can be controlled through D-alanine. The basis of this strain will support future clinical studies of this strain in humans.","Dodds, D; Bose, Jl; Deng, Md; Dubé, Gr; Grossman, Th; Kaiser, A; Kulkarni, K; Leger, R; Mootien-Boyd, S; Munivar, A; Oh, J; Pestrak, M; Rajpur, K; Tikhonov, Ap; Turecek, T; Whitfill, T",10.1128/mSphere.00360-20,Msphere
"Tricks And Tracks Of Prevalence, Occurrences, Treatment Technologies, And Challenges Of Mixtures Of Emerging Contaminants In The Environment: With Special Emphasis On Microplastic","This paper aims to emphasize the occurrence of various emerging contaminant (EC) mixtures in natural ecosystems and highlights the primary concern arising from the unregulated release into soil and water, along with their impacts on human health. Emerging contaminant mixtures, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, antibiotics, biocides, surfactants, phthalates, enteric viruses, and microplastics (MPs), are considered toxic contaminants with grave implications. MPs play a crucial role in transporting pollutants to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as they interact with the various components of the soil and water environments. This review summarizes that major emerging contaminants (ECs), like trimethoprim, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, and 17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol, pose serious threats to public health and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In addressing human health concerns and remediation techniques, this review critically evaluates conventional methods for removing ECs from complex matrices. The diverse physiochemical properties of surrounding environments facilitate the partitioning of ECs into sediments and other organic phases, resulting in carcinogenic, teratogenic, and estrogenic effects through active catalytic interactions and mechanisms mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors. The proactive toxicity of ECs mixture complexation and, in part, the yet-to-be-identified environmental mixtures of ECs represent a blind spot in current literature, necessitating conceptual frameworks for assessing the toxicity and risks with individual components and mixtures. Lastly, this review concludes with an in-depth exploration of future scopes, knowledge gaps, and challenges, emphasizing the need for a concerted effort in managing ECs and other organic pollutants.","Sudarsan, Js; Dogra, K; Kumar, R; Raval, Np; Leifels, M; Mukherjee, S; Trivedi, Mh; Jain, Ms; Zang, J; Barceló, D; Mahlknecht, J; Kumar, M",10.1016/j.jconhyd.2024.104389,Journal Of Contaminant Hydrology
"In Vitro And In Silico Assessment Of Antibiofilm And Antiquorum Sensing Properties Of 2,4-Di-Tert Butylphenol Against Acinetobacter Baumannii","Introduction. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen with a high potential to cause food - borne infections. It is designated as a critical pathogen by the World Health Organization due to its multi - drug resistance and mortalities reported. Biofilm governs major virulence factors, which promotes drug resistance in A. baumannii. Thus, a compound with minimum selection pressure on the pathogen can be helpful to breach biofilm- related virulence. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. To identify antibiofilm and antivirulent metabolites from extracts of wild Mangifera indica (mango) brine pickle bacteria that diminishes pathogenesis and resistance of A. baumannii. Aim. This study reports antibiofilm and antiquorum sensing (QS) efficacy of secondary metabolites from bacterial isolates of fermented food origin. Method. Cell - free supernatants (CFS) of 13 bacterial isolates from fermented mango brine pickles were screened for their efficiency in inhibiting biofilm formation and GC - MS was used to identify its metabolites. Anti- biofilm metabolite was tested on early and mature biofilms, pellicle formation, extra polymeric substances (EPS), cellular adherence, motility and resistance of A. baumannii. Gene expression and in silico studies were also carried out to validate the compounds efficacy. Results. CFS of TMP6b identified as Bacillus vallismortis, inhibited biofilm production (83.02 %). Of these, major compound was identified as 2,4- Di-tert- butyl phenol (2,4- DBP). At sub- lethal concentrations, 2,4- DBP disrupted both early and mature biofilm formation. Treatment with 2,4- DBP destructed in situ biofilm formed on glass and plastic. In addition, key virulence traits like pellicle (77.5 %), surfactant (95.3 %), EPS production (3 - fold) and cell adherence (65.55 %) reduced significantly. A. baumannii cells treated with 2,4- DBP showed enhanced sensitivity towards antibiotics, oxide radicals and blood cells. Expression of biofilm- concomitant virulence genes like csuA/B, pgaC, pgaA, bap, bfmR, katE and ompA along with QS genes abaI, abaR significantly decreased. The in silico studies further validated the higher binding affinity of 2,4- DBP to the AbaR protein than the cognate ligand molecule. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate 2,4- DBP has antipathogenic potential alone and with antibiotics by in vitro, and in silico studies againstA. baumannii. It also indicates its potential use in therapeutics and bio- preservatives.","Jha, Nk; Gopu, V; Sivasankar, C; Singh, Sr; Devi, Pb; Murali, A; Shetty, Ph",10.1099/jmm.0.001813,Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Biomolecule Screen Identifies Several Inhibitors Of Salmonella Enterica Surface Colonization,"Salmonella enterica is a foodborne pathogen commonly found in agricultural facilities; its prevalence, as well as increasing levels of disinfectant- and antibiotic-resistance, has significant costs for agriculture as well as human health. In an effort to identify potential new inhibitors of S. enterica on abiotic surfaces, we developed a biomolecule screen of nutrient-type compounds because nutrients would have lower toxicity in animal facilities and bacterial nutrient utilization pathways might prove less susceptible to the development of bacterial resistance. After screening 285 nutrient-type compounds, we identified ten that significantly inhibited the ability of S. enterica to colonize a plastic surface. After conducting a dose-response curve, salicylic acid was selected for further testing due to its low minimal inhibitory concentration (62.5 mu M) as well as a low total inhibitory concentration (250 mu M). Salicylic acid was also able to inhibit surface colonization of a wide range of bacterial pathogens, suggesting that our biomolecule screen might have broader application beyond S. enterica. Finally, we determined that salicylic acid was also able to inhibit S. enterica colonization of an organic surface on eggshells. Together, these results suggest that nutrient-type biomolecules may provide an avenue for preventing resistant bacteria from contaminating surfaces.","Headrick, J; Ohayon, A; Elliott, S; Schultz, J; Mills, E; Petersen, E",10.3389/fbioe.2024.1467511,Frontiers In Bioengineering And Biotechnology
In Vitro Antibiofilm And Anti-Adhesion Effects Of Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticles Against Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria,"The aim of the current investigation was to determine the antibacterial and antibiofilm potential of MgO nanoparticles (NPs) against antibiotic-resistant clinical strains of bacteria. MgO NPs were synthesized by a wet chemical method and further characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray. Antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution and agar diffusion methods. The Bradford method was used to assess cellular protein leakage as a result of loss of membrane integrity. Microtiter plate assay following crystal violet staining was employed to determine the effect of MgO NPs on biofilm formation and removal of established biofilms. MIC values ranged between 125 and 500g/mL. Moreover, treatment with MgO NPs accelerated rate of membrane disruption, measured as a function of leakage of cellular proteins. Leakage of cellular protein content was greater among gram-negative bacteria. Cell adherence assay indicated 25.3-49.8% inhibition of bacterial attachment to plastic surfaces. According to a static biofilm method, MgO NPs reduced biofilm formation potential from 31% to 82.9% in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, NPs also significantly reduced the biomass of 48, 72, 96 and 120hr old biofilms (P<0.05). Cytotoxicity experiments using a neutral red assay revealed that MgO NPs are non-toxic to HeLa cells at concentrations of 15-120g/mL. These data provide in vitro scientific evidence that MgO NPs are effective and safe antibiofilm agents that inhibit adhesion, biofilm formation and removal of established biofilms of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","Hayat, S; Muzammil, S; Rasool, Mh; Nisar, Z; Hussain, Sz; Sabri, An; Jamil, S",10.1111/1348-0421.12580,Microbiology And Immunology
Soft Surface Nanostructure With Semi-Free Polyionic Components For Sustainable Antimicrobial Plastic,"Surface antimicrobial materials are of interest as they can combat the critical threat of microbial contamination without contributing to issues of environmental contamination and the development drug resistance. Most nanostructured surfaces are prepared by post fabrication modifications and actively release antimicrobial agents. These properties limit the potential applications of nanostructured materials on flexible surfaces. Here, we report on an easily synthesized plastic material with inherent antimicrobial activity, demonstrating excellent microbicidal properties against common bacteria and fungus. The plastic material did not release antimicrobial components as they were anchored to the polymer chains via strong covalent bonds. Time-kill kinetics studies have shown that bactericidal effects take place when bacteria come into contact with a material for a prolonged period, resulting in the deformation and rupture of bacteria cells. A scanning probe microscopy analysis revealed soft nanostructures on the submicron scale, for which the formation is thought to occur via surface phase separation. These soft nanostructures allow for polyionic antimicrobial components to be present on the surface, where they freely interact with and kill microbes. Overall, the new green and sustainable plastic is easily synthesized and demonstrates inherent and long-lasting activity without toxic chemical leaching.","Chan, Sp; Lim, Dsw; Armugam, A; Yi, Gs; Zhang, Yg",10.3390/ijms222212315,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Effects Of Discarded Masks On The Offshore Microorganisms During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"Numerous disposable plastic masks had been produced and used for preventing the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic effectively. Discarded masks are a potential source of microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems. The effect of discarded masks on offshore microorganisms is still unclear. Herein, we profiled the interaction between the microplastics released by discarded masks and marine microbes. The effects of mask quantity, time, and environment on the microplastic-related communities were determined. We characterized the bacterial communities of each group using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing and correlated the community diversity to the physicochemical properties of seawater. We found that the diversity and richness of microflora on the surface of microplastics with different quantity and time varied significantly. Proteobacteria are the main bacteria on microplastics, and the KEGG metabolic pathway prediction shows that amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were abundant. In addition, there was a correlation between bacterial communities and Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO). We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques to evaluate the plastic polymer characteristics of disposable medical masks. Our research shows that disposable medical masks immersed in seawater can alter the microbial community. This study provides the most recent data and insights into the contamination of discarded masks in the marine environment.","Liao, Jl; Ji, Sp; Chi, Yl",10.3390/toxics10080426,Toxics
The Emerging Role Of Exosomes In Cancer Chemoresistance,"Chemoresistance is an impending challenge in cancer treatment. In recent years, exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 40-150 nm in bloodstream and other bio-fluids, have attracted increasing interest. Exosomes contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which act as important signaling molecules. Many reports indicate that exosomes play critical roles in chemoresistance through intercellular interactions, including drug removal from cells, transfer of drug resistance phenotypes to other cancer cells, and the increase in plastic stem cell subsets. Exosomes can reflect the physiological and pathological state of parent cells. Owing to their elevated stability, specificity, and sensitivity, exosomes are served as biomarkers in liquid biopsies to monitor cancer chemoresistance, progression, and recurrence. This review summarizes the exosome-mediated mechanisms of cancer chemoresistance, as well as its role in reversing and monitoring chemoresistance. The scientific and technological challenges and future applications of exosomes are also explored.","Li, J; Gao, N; Gao, Zf; Liu, W; Pang, Br; Dong, Xl; Li, Y; Fan, Tl",10.3389/fcell.2021.737962,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition In Cancer: Complexity And Opportunities,"The cell-biological program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in both development and cancer progression. Depending on the contextual signals and intracellular gene circuits of a particular cell, this program can drive fully epithelial cells to enter into a series of phenotypic states arrayed along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic axis. These cell states display distinctive cellular characteristics, including stemness, invasiveness, drug-resistance and the ability to form metastases at distant organs, and thereby contribute to cancer metastasis and relapse. Currently we still lack a coherent overview of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms inducing cells to enter various states along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic spectrum. An improved understanding of the dynamic and plastic nature of the EMT program has the potential to yield novel therapies targeting this cellular program that may aid in the management of high-grade malignancies.","Zhang, Y; Weinberg, Ra",10.1007/s11684-018-0656-6,Frontiers Of Medicine
Cold Atmospheric Plasma Is A Viable Solution For Treating Orthopedic Infection: A Review,"Bacterial infection and antibiotic resistance are major threats to human health and very few solutions are available to combat this eventuality. A growing number of studies indicate that cold (non-thermal) plasma treatment can be used to prevent or eliminate infection from bacteria, bacterial biofilms, fungi and viruses. Mechanistically, a cold plasma discharge is composed of high-energy electrons that generate short-lived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which further react to form more stable compounds (NO2, H2O2, NH2Cl and others) depending on the gas mixture and plasma parameters. Cold plasma devices are being developed for medical applications including infection, cancer, plastic surgery applications and more.

A Site-Specific Integrative Plasmid Found In Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Clinical Isolate Hs87 Along With A Plasmid Carrying An Aminoglycoside-Resistant Gene,"Plasmids play critical roles in bacterial fitness and evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here two plasmids found in a drug-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolate HS87 were completely sequenced. The pHS87b plasmid (11.2 kb) carries phage-related genes and function-unknown genes. Notably, pHS87b encodes an integrase and has an adjacent tRNA(Thr)-associated attachment site. A corresponding integrated form of pHS87b at the tRNA(Thr) locus was identified on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa, showing that pHS87b is able to site-specifically integrate into the 3'-end of the tRNA(Thr) gene. The pHS87a plasmid (26.8 kb) displays a plastic structure containing a putative replication module, stability factors and a variable region. The RepA of pHS87a shows significant similarity to the replication proteins of pPT23A-family plasmids. pHS87a carries a transposon Tn6049, a truncated insertion sequence Delta IS1071 and a Tn402-like class 1 integron which contains an aacA4 cassette that may confer aminoglycoside resistance. Thus, pHS87b is a site-specific integrative plasmid whereas pHS87a is a plastic antibiotic resistance plasmid. The two native plasmids may promote the fitness and evolution of P. aeruginosa.","Bi, Dx; Xie, Yz; Tai, C; Jiang, Xf; Zhang, J; Harrison, Em; Jia, Sr; Deng, Zx; Rajakumar, K; Ou, Hy",10.1371/journal.pone.0148367,Plos One
Molecular Identification Of Bacteria Isolated From Marketed Sparus Aurata And Penaeus Indicus Sea Products: Antibiotic Resistance Profiling And Evaluation Of Biofilm Formation,"Background: Marketed fish and shellfish are a source of multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Methods: Bacteria isolated from Sparus aurata and Penaeus indicus collected from a local market in Hail region (Saudi Arabia) were isolated on selective and chromogenic media and identified by using 16S RNA sequencing technique. The exoenzyme production and the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of all identified bacteria were also tested. All identified bacteria were tested for their ability to form biofilm by using both qualitative and quantitative assays. Results: Using 16S RNA sequencing method, eight genera were identified dominated by Vibrio (42.85%), Aeromonas (23.80%), and Photobacterium (9.52%). The dominant species were V. natrigens (23.8%) and A. veronii (23.80%). All the identified strains were able to produce several exoenzymes (amylases, gelatinase, haemolysins, lecithinase, DNase, lipase, and caseinase). All tested bacteria were multidrug-resistant with a high value of the multiple antibiotic index (MARI). The antibiotic resistance index (ARI) was about 0.542 for Vibrio spp. and 0.553 for Aeromonas spp. On Congo red agar, six morphotypes were obtained, and 33.33% were slime-positive bacteria. Almost all tested microorganisms were able to form a biofilm on glass tube. Using the crystal violet technique, the tested bacteria were able to form a biofilm on glass, plastic, and polystyrene abiotic surfaces with different magnitude. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that marketed S. aurata and P. indicus harbor various bacteria with human interest that are able to produce several related-virulence factors.","Abdulhakeem, Ma; Alreshidi, M; Bardakci, F; Hamadou, Ws; De Feo, V; Noumi, E; Snoussi, M",10.3390/life13020548,Life-Basel
Genome Plasticity Shapes The Ecology And Evolution Of Phocaeicola Dorei And Phocaeicola Vulgatus,"Phocaeicola dorei and Phocaeicola vulgatus are very common and abundant members of the human gut microbiome and play an important role in the infant gut microbiome. These species are closely related and often confused for one another; yet, their genome comparison, interspecific diversity, and evolutionary relationships have not been studied in detail so far. Here, we perform phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic analyses of these two Phocaeicola species. We report that P. dorei has a larger genome yet a smaller pan-genome than P. vulgatus. We found that this is likely because P. vulgatus is more plastic than P. dorei, with a larger repertoire of genetic mobile elements and fewer anti-phage defense systems. We also found that P. dorei directly descends from a clade of P. vulgatus, and experienced genome expansion through genetic drift and horizontal gene transfer. Overall, P. dorei and P. vulgatus have very different functional and carbohydrate utilisation profiles, hinting at different ecological strategies, yet they present similar antimicrobial resistance profiles.","Morais, Ed; Grimaud, Gm; Warda, A; Stanton, C; Ross, P",10.1038/s41598-024-59148-7,Scientific Reports
A Genetic Toolbox To Empower Paracoccus Pantotrophus Dsm 2944 As A Metabolically Versatile Synbio Chassis,"Background To contribute to the discovery of new microbial strains with metabolic and physiological robustness and develop them into successful chasses, Paracoccus pantotrophus DSM 2944, a Gram-negative bacterium from the phylum Alphaproteobacteria and the family Rhodobacteraceae, was chosen. The strain possesses an innate ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. It utilizes diverse substrates, including cheap and renewable feedstocks, such as C1 and C2 compounds. Also, it can consume short-chain alkanes, predominately found in hydrocarbon-rich environments, making it a potential bioremediation agent. The demonstrated metabolic versatility, coupled with the synthesis of the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate, positions this microbial strain as a noteworthy candidate for advancing the principles of a circular bioeconomy. Results The study aims to follow the chassis roadmap, as depicted by Calero and Nikel, and de Lorenzo, to transform wild-type P. pantotrophus DSM 2944 into a proficient SynBio (Synthetic Biology) chassis. The initial findings highlight the antibiotic resistance profile of this prospective SynBio chassis. Subsequently, the best origin of replication (ori) was identified as RK2. In contrast, the non-replicative ori R6K was selected for the development of a suicide plasmid necessary for genome integration or gene deletion. Moreover, when assessing the most effective method for gene transfer, it was observed that conjugation had superior efficiency compared to electroporation, while transformation by heat shock was ineffective. Robust host fitness was demonstrated by stable plasmid maintenance, while standardized gene expression using an array of synthetic promoters could be shown. pEMG-based scarless gene deletion was successfully adapted, allowing gene deletion and integration. The successful integration of a gene cassette for terephthalic acid degradation is showcased. The resulting strain can grow on both monomers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with an increased growth rate achieved through adaptive laboratory evolution. Conclusion The chassis roadmap for the development of P. pantotrophus DSM 2944 into a proficient SynBio chassis was implemented. The presented genetic toolkit allows genome editing and therewith the possibility to exploit Paracoccus for a myriad of applications.","Pal, U; Bachmann, D; Pelzer, C; Christiansen, J; Blank, Lm; Tiso, T",10.1186/s12934-024-02325-0,Microbial Cell Factories
Rocking- And Diffusion-Based Culture Of Tumor Spheroids-On-A-Chip,"Tumor spheroids are now intensively investigated toward preclinical and clinical applications, necessitating the establishment of accessible and cost-effective methods for routine operations. Without losing the advantage of organ-chip technologies, we developed a rocking system for facile formation and culture of tumor spheroids in hydrogel microwells of a suspended membrane under microfluidic conditions. While the rocking is controlled with a step motor, the microfluidic device is made of two plastic plates, allowing plugging directly syringe tubes with Luer connectors. Upon injection of the culture medium into the tubes and subsequent rocking of the chip, the medium flows back and forth in the channel underneath the membrane, ensuring a diffusion-based culture. Our results showed that such a rocking- and diffusion-based culture method significantly improved the quality of the tumor spheroids when compared to the static culture, particularly in terms of growth rate, roundness, junction formation and compactness of the spheroids. Notably, dynamically cultured tumor spheroids showed increased drug resistance, suggesting alternative assay conditions. Overall, the present method is pumpless, connectionless, and user-friendly, thereby facilitating the advancement of tumor-spheroid-based applications. Tumor spheroids are cultured in hydrogel microwells with a gravity driven medium flow underneath the membrane on-a-chip. The rocking system is pumpless, powered with a rechargeable battery, and programmable with a built-in microprocess.","Tian, Dm; Mao, Z; Wang, L; Huang, Xc; Wang, W; Luo, Hy; Peng, J; Chen, Y",10.1039/d3lc01116j,Lab On A Chip
Intraoperative Bile Culture In Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Teaching Old Dogma New Tricks,"Introduction Biliary stents increase surgical site infections (SSIs) following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to bactibilia and contaminated intraoperative bile spillage. Intraoperative bile culture (IOBC) is performed to guide empiric therapy for SSIs; however, its utility is poorly studied. We sought to evaluate IOBC and the interplay between stenting, bactibilia, and SSI following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 2008 to April 2020 were identified through our institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database; patients without IOBC were excluded. Odds of SSI were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Results Four-hundred-eighty-three patients were identified. One-hundred-eighty-nine (39%) patients had plastic stents and 154 (32%) had metal stents. Three-hundred-twenty-nine (96%) patients with stents had bactibilia versus 18 (13%) without stents (P < 0.001). The biliary microbiome and antibiotic resistance patterns in patients with metal and plastic stents were nearly identical. Of 159 NSQIP-defined SSIs, most were incisional (n = 92, 58%). Bactibilia and stent presence were associated with incisional (OR 3.69 and 3.39, both P < 0.001) but not organ space SSI (P > 0.1); however, stent type was not (P > 0.5). Of the 73 speciated SSI cultures, an IOBC-identified organism was present in 42 (58%), while at least one organism not found in the IOBC was present in 49 (67%). Conclusion Bactibilia is associated with incisional but not organ space SSI following pancreaticoduodenectomy and is strongly associated with stent presence. Stent type does not independently influence the biliary microbiome or SSI risk. IOBC has a poor ability to predict causative organisms in SSIs following pancreaticoduodenectomy and is not recommended for routine use.","Sutton, Tl; O'Grady, J; Martindale, R; Mayo, Sc; Gilbert, Ew; Sheppard, Bc",10.1007/s11605-021-05182-z,Journal Of Gastrointestinal Surgery
Enhanced Asgr2 By Microplastic Exposure Leads To Resistance To Therapy In Gastric Cancer,"Background: Microplastics (MPs) are a new global environmental threat. Previously, we showed the biodistribution of MPs using [Cu-64] polystyrene (PS) and PET in mice. Here, we aimed to identify whether PS exposure has malignant effects on the stomach and induces resistance to therapy. Methods: BALB/c nude mice were fed 1.72 x 10(4) particles/mL of MP. We investigated PS accumulation in the stomach using radioisotope-labeled and fluorescent-conjugated PS. Further, we evaluated whether PS exposure induced cancer stemness and multidrug resistance, and whether it affected tumor development, tumor growth, and survival rate in vivo using a 4-week PS-exposed NCI-N87 mouse model. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we analyzed whether PS exposure induced gene expression changes in gastric tissues of mice. Results: PET imaging results showed that a single dose of [Cu-64]-PS remained for 24 h in the mice stomach. The 4-week daily repetitive dose of fluorescent conjugated PS was deposited in the gastric tissues of mice. When PS was exposed, a 2.9-fold increase in migration rate was observed for NCI-N87 cells. Immunocytochemistry results showed decreased E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin expression, and flow cytometry, qPCR, and western blot analysis indicated a 1.9-fold increase in N-cadherin expression after PS exposure. Further, PS-induced multidrug resistance to bortezomib, paclitaxel, gefitinib, lapatinib, and trastuzumab was observed in the NCI-N87 mouse model due to upregulated CD44 expression. RNA-seq results identified increased asialoglycoprotein receptor 2 (ASGR2) expression after PS exposure, and ASGR2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. Conclusion: We demonstrated that ASGR2 enhanced cancer hallmarks on PS exposure and induced resistance to chemo- and monoclonal antibody-therapy. Our preclinical findings may provide an incentive for further epidemiological studies on the role of MP exposure and its association with gastric cancer.","Kim, H; Zaheer, J; Choi, Ej; Kim, Js",10.7150/thno.73226,Theranostics
Uncovering The Mechanisms Of Acinetobacter Baumannii Virulence,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that causes ventilator-associated as well as bloodstream infections in critically ill patients, and the spread of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter strains is cause for concern. Much of the success of A. baumannii can be directly attributed to its plastic genome, which rapidly mutates when faced with adversity and stress. However, fundamental virulence mechanisms beyond canonical drug resistance were recently uncovered that enable A. baumannii and, to a limited extent, other medically relevant Acinetobacter species to successfully thrive in the health-care environment. In this Review, we explore the molecular features that promote environmental persistence, including desiccation resistance, biofilm formation and motility, and we discuss the most recently identified virulence factors, such as secretion systems, surface glycoconjugates and micronutrient acquisition systems that collectively enable these pathogens to successfully infect their hosts.","Harding, Cm; Hennon, Sw; Feldman, Mf",10.1038/nrmicro.2017.148,Nature Reviews Microbiology
"Molecular Epidemiology, Microbiological Features And Infection Control Strategies For Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii In A German Burn And Plastic Surgery Center (2020-2022)","Background Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) frequently causes both healthcare-associated infections and nosocomial outbreaks in burn medicine/plastic surgery and beyond. Owing to the high antibiotic resistance, infections are difficult to treat, and patient outcomes are often compromised. The environmental persistence capability of CRAB favors its transmission in hospitals. A comprehensive analysis and understanding of CRAB epidemiology and microbiology are essential for guiding management. Methods A three-year retrospective cohort study (2020-2022) was conducted in a German tertiary burn and plastic surgery center. In addition to epidemiological analyses, microbiological and molecular techniques, including whole-genome sequencing, were applied for the comprehensive examination of isolates from CRAB-positive patients. Results During the study period, eight CRAB cases were found, corresponding to an overall incidence of 0.2 CRAB cases per 100 cases and an incidence density of 0.35 CRAB cases per 1000 patient-days. Six cases (75%) were treated in the burn intensive care unit, and four cases (50%) acquired CRAB in the hospital. Molecular analyses comprising 74 isolates supported the epidemiologic assumption that hospital acquisitions occurred within two separate clusters. In one of these clusters, environmental CRAB contamination of anesthesia equipment may have enabled transmission. Furthermore, molecular diversity of CRAB isolates within patients was observed. Conclusions CRAB can pose a challenge in terms of infection prevention and control, especially if cases are clustered in time and space on a ward. Our study demonstrates that high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial isolates from single patients can greatly aid in understanding transmission chains and helps to take precision control measures.","Vital, M; Woltemate, S; Schlüter, D; Krezdorn, N; Dieck, T; Dastagir, K; Bange, Fc; Ebadi, E; Vogt, Pm; Knegendorf, L; Baier, C",10.1186/s13756-024-01459-5,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Sex-Specific Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastic And Lead(Ii) Co-Exposure On The Gut Microbiome And Fecal Metabolome In C57Bl/6 Mice,"The wide spread of microplastics has fueled growing public health concern globally. Due to their porous structure and large surface area, microplastics can serve as carriers for other environmental pollutants, including heavy metals. Although the toxic effects of microplastics or heavy metals have been reported previously, investigations into the sex-differential health effects of combined exposure to microplastics and heavy metals are lacking. In the present study, the effects of polystyrene microplastics and lead(II) co-exposure on the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, and fecal metabolome were examined in both male and female mice. Combined exposure of polystyrene microplastics and lead(II) increased intestinal permeability in both male and female mice. Sex-specific responses to the co-exposure were found in gut bacteria, fungi, microbial metabolic pathways, microbial genes encoding antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, as well as fecal metabolic profiles. In particular, Shannon and Simpson indices of gut bacteria were reduced by the co-exposure only in female mice. A total of 34 and 13 fecal metabolites were altered in the co-exposure group in female and male mice, respectively, among which only three metabolites were shared by both sexes. These sex-specific responses to the co-exposure need to be taken into consideration when investigating the combined toxic effects of microplastics and heavy metals on the gut microbiota.","Shen, Ws; Zhao, M; Xu, Wc; Shi, Xc; Ren, Ff; Tu, Pc; Gao, N; Shan, Jj; Gao, B",10.3390/metabo14040189,Metabolites
Antibiotic Prophylaxis After Immediate Breast Reconstruction: The Reality Of Its Efficacy,"Background: Numerous techniques are used to prevent infection after immediate implant-based breast reconstruction. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly prescribed to decrease the risk of reconstructive failure, despite conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness. The authors studied whether postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of infection-related explantation in the setting of immediate prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. Methods: Using Truven MarketScan databases, the authors identified all patients who underwent immediate implant reconstruction between January of 2010 and June of 2014 with at least 6 months of follow-up. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as any oral antibiotic course to be taken postoperatively based on prescriptions filled within 14 days preoperatively through 24 hours after discharge. Reconstructive failure, defined as explantation because of infection, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes of interest included wound complications, infection, and readmission for infection. Multivariable regression analyses controlled for demographic variables/comorbidities. Results: Of the 7443 patients, 6049 (81 percent) filled prescriptions for postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. These patients were equally likely to develop a wound complication (OR, 0.93; 95 percent CI, 0.71 to 1.23) or infection (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.70 to 1.14), undergo explantation because of infection (OR, 0.82; 95 percent CI, 0.57 to 1.18), or require readmission for infection (OR, 1.21; 95 percent CI, 0.82 to 1.78) compared with those who did not receive antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the risk of infection-related outcomes based on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Conclusions: Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was not associated with a reduced risk of infection or explantation following prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. Given rising rates of antibiotic resistance, focusing instead on technical considerations and the management of comorbid conditions may more effectively enhance the safety of breast reconstruction.

Novel Fusidic Acid Cream Containing Metal Ions And Natural Products Against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Background: Drug design and development to overcome antimicrobial resistance continues to be an area of research due to the evolution of microbial resistance mechanisms and the necessity for new treatments. Natural products have been used since the dawn of medicine to heal skin infections. The antimicrobial properties of fusidic acid, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate have been studied and are well known. Furthermore, these compounds have different mechanisms of action in targeting microorganisms, either by inhibiting protein synthesis or bacterial cell walls. Therefore, their combination is expected to have synergistic activity in killing bacteria. However, the synergistic antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated in a cream formulation. Therefore, the objectives of this in vitro study were to develop and evaluate the synergistic efficacy of fusidic acid in combinations with natural products, including oleuropein, thyme oil, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate, as a cream to eradicate fusidic-acid-resistant microorganisms in skin infections. Methods: Three different cream formulations were developed, compared, and labeled F1, F2, and F3. The compounds were studied for their antibacterial activity. In addition, the stability of the cream was investigated at 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C in plastic jars over three months. Results: The F2 formula has adequate physicochemical properties. Furthermore, it displays stable and better results than the marketed trade product and has potential inhibition zones (ZOI). Interestingly, considerable numbers (9.5%) of fusidic-acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FRSA) isolates possessed a high resistance pattern with MIC >= 128 mu g/mL. In contrast, most tested FRSA isolates (90.5%) had a low resistance pattern with MIC <= 8 mu g/mL. Conclusion: In conclusion, the F2 cream made with fusidic acid, oleuropein, thyme oil, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate in the right amounts has stable physical and chemical properties and has potential against FRSA as an antimicrobial agent.","Naseef, H; Sahoury, Y; Farraj, M; Qurt, M; Abukhalil, Ad; Jaradat, N; Sabri, I; Rabba, Ak; Sbeih, M",10.3390/pharmaceutics14081638,Pharmaceutics

The Evolutionary Advantage Of Heritable Phenotypic Heterogeneity,"Phenotypic plasticity is an evolutionary driving force in diverse biological processes, including the adaptive immune system, the development of neoplasms, and the persistence of pathogens despite drug pressure. It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers on cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population of individuals that can express only a single phenotype. We show that the advantage of such a mutation depends on the degree of phenotypic heritability between generations, called phenotypic memory. We analyze the fixation probability of the phenotypically plastic allele as a function of phenotypic memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In constant environments, plastic alleles are advantageous and their fixation probability increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic allele's fixation. This same optimum memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome persistence and, indirectly, drug resistance.","Carja, O; Plotkin, Jb",10.1038/s41598-017-05214-2,Scientific Reports
Znf397 Deficiency Triggers Tet2-Driven Lineage Plasticity And Ar-Targeted Therapy Resistance In Prostate Cancer,"ZNF397 is a molecular switch between AR-driven, therapy-sensitive prostate cancer and TET2-driven, lineage plastic, therapy-resistant cancer, highlighting TET2 and epigenetic rewiring as targets to overcome resistance. Cancer cells exhibit phenotypical plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming that allows them to evade lineage-dependent targeted treatments by adopting lineage plasticity. The underlying mechanisms by which cancer cells exploit the epigenetic regulatory machinery to acquire lineage plasticity and therapy resistance remain poorly understood. We identified zinc finger protein 397 (ZNF397) as a bona fide coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR), essential for the transcriptional program governing AR-driven luminal lineage. ZNF397 deficiency facilitates the transition of cancer cell from an AR-driven luminal lineage to a ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2)-driven lineage plastic state, ultimately promoting resistance to therapies inhibiting AR signaling. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that a TET2 inhibitor can eliminate the resistance to AR-targeted therapies in ZNF397-deficient tumors. These insights uncover a novel mechanism through which prostate cancer acquires lineage plasticity via epigenetic rewiring and offer promising implications for clinical interventions designed to overcome therapy resistance dictated by lineage plasticity.Significance: This study reveals a bifurcated role of ZNF397, and a TET2-driven epigenetic mechanism regulating tumor lineage plasticity and therapy response in prostate cancer, enhances the understanding of drug resistance, and unveils a new therapeutic strategy for overcoming androgen receptor-targeted therapy resistance.","Xu, Yr; Yang, Yq; Wang, Zn; Sjoestroem, M; Jiang, Yy; Tang, Yt; Cheng, Sy; Deng, S; Wang, Cs; Gonzalez, J; Johnson, Na; Li, X; Li, Xl; Metang, La; Mukherji, A; Xu, Qh; Tirado, Cr; Wainwright, G; Yu, Xz; Barnes, S; Hofstad, M; Chen, Y; Zhu, H; Hanker, Ab; Raj, Gv; Zhu, Gh; He, Hh; Wang, Z; Arteaga, Cl; Liang, H; Feng, Fy; Wang, Yg; Wang, T; Mu, P",10.1158/2159-8290.CD-23-0539,Cancer Discovery
Cancer Stem Cells And The Slow Cycling Phenotype: How To Cut The Gordian Knot Driving Resistance To Therapy In Melanoma,"Simple Summary Cancer stem cells play a central role in the development of cancer and are poorly sensitive to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Furthermore, they are also responsible for the onset of drug resistance. This also occurs in malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Hence, cancer stem cells eradication is one of the main challenges for medical oncology. Here, we conducted a bioinformatics approach aimed to identify the main circuits and proteins underpinning cancer stem cell fitness in melanoma. Several lessons emerged from our work and may help to conceptualize future therapeutic approaches to prolong the efficacy of current therapies. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have historically been defined as slow cycling elements that are able to differentiate into mature cells but without dedifferentiation in the opposite direction. Thanks to advances in genomic and non-genomic technologies, the CSC theory has more recently been reconsidered in a dynamic manner according to a phenotype switching plastic model. Transcriptional reprogramming rewires this plasticity and enables heterogeneous tumors to influence cancer progression and to adapt themselves to drug exposure by selecting a subpopulation of slow cycling cells, similar in nature to the originally defined CSCs. This model has been conceptualized for malignant melanoma tailored to explain resistance to target therapies. Here, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of available data directed to the identification of the molecular pathways sustaining slow cycling melanoma stem cells. Using this approach, we identified a signature of 25 genes that were assigned to four major clusters, namely (1) kinases and metabolic changes, (2) melanoma-associated proteins, (3) Hippo pathway and (4) slow cycling/CSCs factors. Furthermore, we show how a protein-protein interaction network may be the main driver of these melanoma cell subpopulations. Finally, mining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data we evaluated the expression levels of this signature in the four melanoma mutational subtypes. The concomitant alteration of these genes correlates with the worst overall survival (OS) for melanoma patients harboring BRAF-mutations. All together these results underscore the potentiality to target this signature to selectively kill CSCs and to achieve disease control in melanoma.","Fattore, L; Mancini, R; Ciliberto, G",10.3390/cancers12113368,Cancers
Expander/Implant Removal After Breast Reconstruction: Analysis Of Risk Factors And Timeline,"Removal of tissue expanders (TE) or implants is a dire consequence of breast reconstruction, and has the potential to halt the reconstructive efforts. Our goals were to characterize a cohort of patients with TE/implant removal, to perform a time-based analysis, and to review the bacteriology associated with explanted devices. Review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify patients who underwent TE/implant removal. Patient characteristics, surgical technique, adjuvant therapies, indications, complications, culture results were obtained. Data were analyzed according to timing of explantation. A total of 55 TE and implants were removed in 43 patients. Reasons for explantation were infection (58%), patient request (22%), and wound-related complications (20%). The majority of explantations occurred after 30 days (62%), and after Stage I (81%). Median days to explantation was 62. Patients of older age (p = 0.01) and higher BMI (p = 0.02) were more likely to undergo explantation after Stage I. The most commonly cultured organisms were S. epidermidis (10.9%), S. aureus (10.9%) and P. aeruginosa (10.9%). Antibiotic resistance was commonly encountered for ampicillin, cefazolin, penicillin, and erythromycin. Infection is the most common reason for explantation after prosthetic breast reconstruction. Patients should be carefully monitored for a prolonged period of time after Stage I, as the majority of explantations occur in this stage but beyond 30 days. For oral treatment, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and for IV treatment a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenems/carbapenems appear to be appropriate choices according to our culture results.

Water And Health: From Environmental Pressures To Integrated Responses,"The water-related exposome is a significant determinant of human health. The disease burden through water results from water-associated communicable and non-communicable diseases and is influenced by water pollution with chemicals, solid waste (mainly plastics), pathogens, insects and other disease vectors. This paper analyses a range of water practitioner-driven health issues, including infectious diseases and chemical intoxication, using the conceptual framework of Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses (DPSIR), complemented with a selective literature review. Pressures in the environment result in changes in the State of the water body: chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the presence of vectors. These and other health hazards affect the State of human health. The resulting Impacts in an exposed population or affected ecosystem, in turn incite Responses. Pathways from Drivers to Impacts are quite divergent for chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in vectors of disease and for the combined effects of plastics. Potential Responses from the water sector, however, show remarkable similarities. Integrated water management interventions have the potential to address Drivers, Pressures, Impacts, and State of several health issues at the same time. Systematic and integrated planning and management of water resources, with an eye for human health, could contribute to reducing or preventing negative health impacts and enhancing the health benefits.","Boelee, E; Geerling, G; Van Der Zaan, B; Blauw, A; Vethaak, Ad",10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.011,Acta Tropica
The Plasticity Of Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells: Implications In Therapeutic Resistance,"The ever-growing perception of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as a plastic state rather than a hardwired defined entity has evolved our understanding of the functional and biological plasticity of these elusive components in malignancies. Pancreatic cancer (PC), based on its biological features and clinical evolution, is a prototypical example of a CSC-driven disease. Since the discovery of pancreatic CSCs (PCSCs) in 2007, evidence has unraveled their control over many facets of the natural history of PC, including primary tumor growth, metastatic progression, disease recurrence, and acquired drug resistance. Consequently, the current near-ubiquitous treatment regimens for PC using aggressive cytotoxic agents, aimed at ''tumor debulking'' rather than eradication of CSCs, have proven ineffective in providing clinically convincing improvements in patients with this dreadful disease. Herein, we review the key hallmarks as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms of CSCs that mediate treatment failure in PC and enlist the potential CSC-targeting 'natural agents' that are gaining popularity in recent years. A better understanding of the molecular and functional landscape of PCSC-intrinsic evasion of chemotherapeutic drugs offers a facile opportunity for treating PC, an intractable cancer with a grim prognosis and in dire need of effective therapeutic advances.","Patil, K; Khan, Fb; Akhtar, S; Ahmad, A; Uddin, S",10.1007/s10555-021-09979-x,Cancer And Metastasis Reviews
Redirecting Tumor Evolution With Nanocompiler Precision For Enhanced Therapeutic Outcomes,"Precisely programming the highly plastic tumor expression profile to render it devoid of drug resistance and metastatic potential presents immense challenges. Here, a transformative nanocompiler designed to reprogram and stabilize the mutable state of tumor cells is introduced. This nanocompiler features a trio of components: 2-deoxy-d-glucose-modified lipid nanoparticles to inhibit glucose uptake, iron oxide nanoparticles to induce oxidative stress, and a deubiquitinase inhibitor to block adaptive protein profile changes in tumor cells. By specifically targeting the hypermetabolic nature of tumors, this approach disrupted their energy production, ultimately fostering a state of vulnerability and impeding their ability to adapt and resist. The results of this study indicate a substantial reduction in tumor growth and metastasis, thus demonstrating the potential of this strategy to manipulate tumor protein expression and fate. This proactive nanocompiler approach promises to steer cancer therapy toward more effective and lasting outcomes. A nanocompiler integrating glucose competition, oxidative stress induction, and deubiquitinase inhibition is developed to reprogram tumor cells from a plastic state to a vulnerable one. By disrupting energy production and impeding adaptive protein profile changes, this approach reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, showcasing the potential to actively manipulate tumor evolution and enhance cancer therapy efficacy. image","Sun, Ws; Cai, B; Zhao, Zj; Li, Sl; He, Yt; Xie, Sw",10.1002/adhm.202400366,Advanced Healthcare Materials
A Cell-Fate Reprogramming Strategy Reverses Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition Of Lung Cancer Cells While Avoiding Hybrid States,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of primary cancer contributes to the acquisition of lethal properties, including metastasis and drug resistance. Blocking or reversing EMT could be an effective strategy to improve cancer treatment. However, it is still unclear how to achieve complete EMT reversal (rEMT), as cancer cells often transition to hybrid EMT states with high metastatic potential. To tackle this problem, we employed a systems biology approach and identified a core-regulatory circuit that plays the primary role in driving rEMT without hybrid properties. Perturba-tion of any single node was not sufficient to completely revert EMT. Inhibition of both SMAD4 and ERK signaling along with p53 activation could induce rEMT in cancer cells even with TGFI3 stimulation, a primary inducer of EMT. Induction of rEMT in lung cancer cells with the triple combination approach restored chemo-sensitivity. This cell-fate reprogramming strategy based on attractor landscapes revealed potential therapeutic targets that can eradicate metastatic potential by subverting EMT while avoiding hybrid states.Significance: Network modeling unravels the highly complex and plastic process regulating epithelial and mesenchymal states in cancer cells and discovers therapeutic interventions for reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhancing chemosensitivity.","Kim, N; Hwang, Cy; Kim, T; Kim, H; Cho, Kh",10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-1559,Cancer Research
Novel Inhibitors That Target Bacterial Virulence Identified Via Hts Against Intra-Macrophage Survival Of Shigella Flexneri,"Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes shigellosis, a human diarrheal antimicrobial compounds to treat infections are urgently needed due to the proliferation of bacterial antibiotic resistance and lack of new effective antimicrobials in the market. Our approach to find compounds that block the Shigella virulence pathway has three potential advantages: (i) resistance development should be minimized due to the lack of growth selection pressure, (ii) no resistance due to environmental antibiotic exposure should be developed since the virulence pathways are not activated outside of host infection, and (iii) the normal intestinal microbiota, which do not have the targeted virulence pathways, should be unharmed. We chose to utilize two phenotypic assays, inhibition of Shigella survival in macrophages and Shigella growth inhibition (minimum inhibitory concentration), to interrogate the 1.7 M compound screening collection subset of the GlaxoSmithKline drug discovery chemical library. A number of secondary assays on the hit compounds resulting from the primary screens were conducted, which, in combination with chemical, structural, and physical property analyses, narrowed the final hit list to 44 promising compounds for further drug discovery efforts.. IMPORTANCE The rapid development of antibiotic resistance is a critical problem that has the potential of returning the world to a pre-antibiotic type of environment, where millions of people will die from previously treatable infections. One relatively newer approach to minimize the selection pressures for the development of resistance is to target virulence pathways. This is anticipated to eliminate any resistance selection pressure in environmental exposure to virulence-targeted antibiotics and will have the added benefit of not affecting the non-virulent microbiome. This paper describes the development and application of a simple, reproducible, and sensitive assay to interrogate an extensive chemical library in high-throughput screening format for activity against the survival of Shigella flexneri 2457T-nl in THP-1 macrophages. The ability to screen very large numbers of compounds in a reasonable time frame (similar to 1.7 M compounds in similar to 8months)distinguishes this assay as a powerful tool in further exploring pounds in similar to 8 months) distinguishes this assay as a powerful tool in further exploring new compounds with intracellular effect on S. flexneri or other pathogens with similar pathways of pathogenesis. The assay utilizes a luciferase reporter which is extremely rapid, simple, relatively inexpensive, and sensitive and possesses a broad linear range. The assay also utilized THP-1 cells that resemble primary monocytes and macrophages in morphology and differentiation differentiation properties. THP-1 cells have advantages over human primary monocytes or macrophages because they are highly plastic and their homogeneous genetic background minimizes the degree of variability in the cell phenotype (1). The intracellular and virulence-targeted selectivity of our methodology, determined via secondary screening, is an enormous advantage. Our main interest focuses on hits that are targeting virulence, and the most promising compounds with adequate physicochemical and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties will be progressed to a suitable in vivo shigellosis model to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this approach. Additionally, compounds that act via a host-directed mechanism could be a promising source for further research given that it would allow a whole new, specific,specific,specific, and controlled approach to the treatment of diseases caused by some pathogenic bacteria.","Miljkovic, M; Lozano, S; Castellote, I; De Cózar, C; Villegas-Moreno, Ai; Gamallo, P; Martinez, Dja; Fernández-Alvaro, E; Ballell, L; Garcia, Ga",10.1128/msphere.00154-23,Msphere
Visualization Of Aspergillus Fumigatus Biofilms With Scanning Electron Microscopy And Variable Pressure-Scanning Electron Microscopy: A Comparison Of Processing Techniques,"Aspergillus fumigatus biofilms consist of a three-dimensional network of cellular hyphae and extracellular matrix. They are involved in infections of immune-compromised individuals, particularly those with cystic fibrosis. These structures are associated with persistence of infection, resistance to host immunity, and antimicrobial resistance. Thorough understanding of structure and function is imperative in the design of therapeutic drugs. Optimization of processing parameters, including aldehyde fixation, heavy metal contrasting, drying techniques and Ionic Liquid treatment, was undertaken for an ultrastructural approach to understand cellular and extracellular biofilm components. Conventional and Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscopy were applied to analyze the structure of biofilms attached to plastic and formed at an air-liquid interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dual Predation By Bacteriophage And Bdellovibrio Bacteriovorus Can Eradicate Escherichia Coli Prey In Situations Where Single Predation Cannot,"Bacteria are preyed upon by diverse microbial predators, including bacteriophage and predatory bacteria, such as Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. While bacteriophage are used as antimicrobial therapies in Eastern Europe and are being applied for compassionate use in the United States, predatory bacteria are only just beginning to reveal their potential therapeutic uses. However, predation by either predator type can falter due to different adaptations arising in the prey bacteria. When testing poultry farm wastewater for novel Bdellovibrio isolates on Escherichia coli prey lawns, individual composite plaques were isolated containing both an RTP (rosette-tailed-phage)-like-phage and a B. bacteriovorus strain and showing central prey lysis and halos of extra lysis. Combining the purified phage with a lab strain of B. bacteriovorus HD100 recapitulated haloed plaques and increased killing of the E. coli prey in liquid culture, showing an effective side-by-side action of these predators compared to their actions alone. Using approximate Bayesian computation to select the best fitting from a variety of different mathematical models demonstrated that the experimental data could be explained only by assuming the existence of three prey phenotypes: (i) sensitive to both predators, (ii) genetically resistant to phage only, and (iii) plastic resistant to B. bacteriovorus only. Although each predator reduces prey availability for the other, high phage numbers did not abolish B. bacteriovorus predation, so both predators are competent to coexist and are causing different selective pressures on the bacterial surface while, in tandem, controlling prey bacterial numbers efficiently. This suggests that combinatorial predator therapy could overcome problems of phage resistance. IMPORTANCE With increasing levels of antibiotic resistance, the development of alternative antibacterial therapies is urgently needed. Two potential alternatives are bacteriophage and predatory bacteria. Bacteriophage therapy has been used, but prey/host specificity and the rapid acquisition of bacterial resistance to bacteriophage are practical considerations. Predatory bacteria are of interest due to their broad Gram-negative bacterial prey range and the lack of simple resistance mechanisms. Here, a bacteriophage and a strain of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, preyed side by side on a population of E. coli, causing a significantly greater decrease in prey numbers than either alone. Such combinatorial predator therapy may have greater potential than individual predators since prey surface changes selected for by each predator do not protect prey against the other predator.","Hobley, L; Summers, Jk; Till, R; Milner, Ds; Atterbury, Rj; Stroud, A; Capeness, Mj; Gray, S; Leidenroth, A; Lambert, C; Connerton, I; Twycross, J; Baker, M; Tyson, J; Kreft, Ju; Sockett, Re",10.1128/JB.00629-19,Journal Of Bacteriology
Stronger Geographic Limitations Shape A Rapid Turnover And Potentially Highly Connected Network Of Core Bacteria On Microplastics,"Core microbiota is shared microbial taxa within the same habitat, which is important for understanding the stable and consistent components of the complex microbial assembly. However, information on the microplastic core bacteria from the river ecosystems is poor. Here, we investigated the composition and function of microplastic core bacteria from the Three Gorges Reservoir area along the approximate 662 km of the Yangtze River via full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, compared with those in water, sediment, and soil. The results showed that the spatial turnover of bacterial communities in four habitats supported deterministic processes dominated by niche differentiation, which shaped their core bacteria. The composition and function of microplastic core bacteria were significantly different from those in the other three habitats. Rhodobacteraceae was the main component of microplastic core bacteria, while the main component of core bacteria in water, sediment, and soil were Burkholderiaceae (21.90%), Burkholderiaceae (5.01%), Nitrosomonadaceae (4.61%), respectively. Furthermore, microplastic core bacteria had stronger geographic limitations along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Stronger geographic limitations shaped the rapid community turnover and a potentially more connected network for the microplastic core bacteria than water, sediment, and soil. More importantly, microplastic core bacteria had strong potential functions of drug resistance and could cause risks to ecosystems and human health. Microplastic core bacteria were mainly influenced by sediment core bacteria, although the bacteria colonizing on microplastics could be from all the contact environments and original sources. These findings provide important insights into the composition, function, and association of microplastic core bacteria with their surrounding environment.","Zhang, Wh; Wan, Wj; Liu, Xn; Yang, Yy; Liu, Mx",10.1007/s00248-022-02000-0,Microbial Ecology
Plastic Pollution As A Novel Reservoir For The Environmental Survival Of The Drug Resistant Fungal Pathogen Candida Auris,"The WHO recently classified Candida auris as a fungal pathogen of critical concern. Evidence suggests that C. auris emerged from the natural environment, yet the ability of this pathogenic yeast to survive in the natural environment is still poorly understood. The aim of this study, therefore, was to quantify the persistence of C. auris in simulated environmental matrices and explore the role of plastic pollution for facilitating survival and potential transfer of C. auris. Multi-drug resistant strains of C. auris persisted for over 30 days in river water or seawater, either planktonically, or in biofilms colonising high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or glass. C. auris could be transferred from plastic beads onto simulated beach sand, particularly when the sand was wet. Importantly, all C. auris cells recovered from plastics retained their pathogenicity; therefore, plastic pollution could play a significant role in the widescale environmental dissemination of this recently emerged pathogen.","Akinbobola, A; Kean, R; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115841,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Differences In The Plastispheres Of Biodegradable And Non-Biodegradable Plastics: A Mini Review,"There has been a steady rise in the production and disposal of biodegradable plastics. Unlike the microorganisms present in the biofilms on non-biodegradable plastic surfaces (the plastisphere), the plastisphere of biodegradable plastic has not been well-characterized. As the polymer structure of biodegradable plastic has a higher microbial affinity than that of non-biodegradable plastic, their plastispheres are assumed to be different. This review summarizes the reported differences in microbial communities on the surface of biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, discusses the driving forces behind these differences, and discusses the potential environmental risks. Overall, the plastisphere biomass on the surface of non-biodegradable plastic was observed to be lower than that of biodegradable plastic. The community structure of microbes in both plastispheres was diverse, mainly due to the properties of the plastic surface, such as surface charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, roughness, and bioavailability of polymer components for microbes. Further research should focus on developing biodegradable plastic that degrade faster in the environment, revealing the mechanism of enrichment of ARGs and potential pathogens on plastics, and understanding the potential influence of plastispheres on the evolution and selection of plastic-degrading microbial potential.","Peng, C; Wang, J; Liu, Xh; Wang, L",10.3389/fmicb.2022.849147,Frontiers In Microbiology
The Future For Mediterranean Wetlands: 50 Key Issues And 50 Important Conservation Research Questions,"Wetlands are critically important for biodiversity and human wellbeing, but face a range of challenges. This is especially true in the Mediterranean region, where wetlands support endemic and threatened species and remain integral to human societies, but have been severely degraded in recent decades. Here, in order to raise awareness of future challenges and opportunities for Mediterranean wetlands, and to inform proactive research and management, we identified (a) 50 key issues that might affect Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050, and (b) 50 important research questions that, if answered, would have the greatest impact on the conservation of Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050. We gathered ideas through an online survey and review of recent literature. A diverse assessment panel prioritised ideas through an iterative, anonymised, Delphi-like process of scoring, voting and discussion. The prioritised issues included some that are already well known but likely to have a large impact on Mediterranean wetlands in the next 30 years (e.g. the accumulation of dams and reservoirs, plastic pollution and weak governance), and some that are currently overlooked in the context of Mediterranean wetlands (e.g. increasing desalination capacity and development of antimicrobial resistance). Questions largely focused on how best to carry out conservation interventions, or understanding the impacts of threats to inform conservation decision-making. This analysis will support research, policy and practice related to environmental conservation and sustainable development in the Mediterranean, and provides a model for similar analyses elsewhere in the world.","Taylor, Ng; Grillas, P; Al Hreisha, H; Balkiz, Ö; Borie, M; Boutron, O; Catita, A; Champagnon, J; Cherif, S; Çiçek, K; Costa, Lt; Dakki, M; Fois, M; Galewski, T; Galli, A; Georgiadis, Nm; Green, Aj; Hermoso, V; Kapedani, R; Lange, Ma; Mateljak, Z; Osta, M; Papastergiadou, E; Papazoglou, C; Sabater, S; Samraoui, B; Samraoui, F; Bachir, As; Tankovic, E; Thévenet, M; Troya, A; Sutherland, Wj",10.1007/s10113-020-01743-1,Regional Environmental Change
Gross Negligence: Impacts Of Microplastics And Plastic Leachates On Phytoplankton Community And Ecosystem Dynamics,"Plastic debris is an established environmental menace affecting aquatic systems globally. Recently, microplastics (MP) and plastic leachates (PL) have been detected in vital human organs, the vascular system, and in vitro animal studies positing severe health hazards. MP and PL have been found in every conceivable aquatic ecosystem-from open oceans and deep sea floors to supposedly pristine glacier lakes and snow covered mountain catchment sites. Many studies have documented the MP and PL impacts on a variety of aquatic organisms, whereby some exclusively focus on aquatic microorganisms. Yet, the specific MP and PL impacts on primary producers have not been systematically analyzed. Therefore, this review focuses on the threats posed by MP, PL, and associated chemicals on phytoplankton, their comprehensive impacts at organismal, community, and ecosystem scales, and their endogenous amelioration. Studies on MP-and PL-impacted individual phytoplankton species reveal the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, physical damage of thylakoids, and other physiological and metabolic changes, followed by homo-and heteroaggregations, ultimately eventuating in decreased photosynthesis and primary productivity. Likewise, analyses of the microbial community in the plastisphere show a radically different profile compared to the surrounding planktonic diversity. The plastisphere also enriches multidrug-resistant bacteria, cyanotoxins, and pollutants, accelerating microbial succession, changing the microbiome, and thus, affecting phytoplankton diversity and evolution. These impacts on cellular and community scales manifest in changed ecosystem dynamics with widespread bottom-up and top-down effects on aquatic biodiversity and food web interactions. These adverse effects-through altered nutrient cycling-have knock-on impacts on biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gases. Consequently, these impacts affect provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Our citation network analyses (CNA) further demonstrate dire effects of MP and PL on all trophic levels, thereby unsettling ecosystem stability and services. CNA points to several emerging nodes indicating combined toxicity of MP, PL, and their associated hazards on phytoplankton. Taken together, our study shows that ecotoxicity of plastic particles and their leachates have placed primary producers and some aquatic ecosystems in peril.","Ramanan, R; Amaneesh, C; Balan, Sa; Silpa, Ps; Kim, Jw; Greeshma, K; Mohan, Aa; Antony, Ar; Grossart, Hp; Kim, Hs",10.1021/acs.est.2c05817,Environmental Science & Technology
Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics For Breast Expander/Implant Infection Treatment-Related Adverse Events And Outcomes,"Background Despite best practices, infection remains the most common complication after breast reconstruction with expanders and implants, ranging from 2% to 29%. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently used in nonsurgical treatment of implant-associated infections in an effort to salvage the reconstruction. Pitfalls of antibiotherapy include adverse events, vascular access site complications, and drug resistance. Our goals were to describe management of implant infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics, review treatment related adverse events, and report on outcomes of therapy. Patients and Methods A retrospective review was carried out to identify patients who were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for periprosthetic infection. Patient characteristics, surgical details, and antibiotic therapy-related adverse events were collected. Eventual outcome related to expander/implant salvage was noted. Results A total of 101 patients (111 treatment episodes) were identified. Mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 18 days (range, 1-40 days). The most commonly used parenteral treatment was a combination of daptomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam (65%) or an alternative agent (16%). Fifty-nine percent of treatment episodes resulted in salvage of the expander or implant. Thirty-five percent treatment episodes were associated with 1 or more adverse events: diarrhea (12.6%), rash (10%), vaginal candidiasis (3.6%), agranulocytosis/neutropenic fever (3.6%), nausea (3.6%), urinary complaint (0.9%), myositis (0.9%), headache (0.9%), vascular line occlusion (1.8%), deep vein thrombosis (1.8%), and finger numbness (0.9%). No patients developed Clostridium difficile colitis. Five episodes (4%) needed discontinuation of antibiotics because of severe adverse events. The prosthesis was explanted in 3 of the cases of discontinued treatment. Conclusions Our findings show favorable outcomes and well-tolerated adverse effects with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotherapy for periprosthetic infection. However, every effort should be made to deescalate therapy by narrowing the spectrum or limiting the duration, to minimize adverse events and development of bacterial resistance. Treating surgeons need to carefully weigh benefits of therapy and be aware of potential complications that might necessitate discontinuation of treatment.","Ozturk, Cn; Ozturk, C; Sigurdson, Sl; Magner, Wj; Sheedy, B; Lohman, R; Moon, W",10.1097/SAP.0000000000002720,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Cutaneous Mycobacterium Abscessus Infection Following Plastic Surgery: Three Case Reports,"Aim: Mycobacterium abscessus is ubiquitous in the environment and seldom causes infections in immunocompetent individuals. However, skin and soft tissue infections caused by M. abscessus have been reported in recent years. Additionally, the cutaneous infections or outbreaks post cosmetic surgery caused by M. abscessus have been increasing due to the popularity of plastic surgery. The main modes of transmission are through contaminated saline, disinfectants, or surgery equipment, as well as close contact between patients. This article describes three patients who were admitted to our hospital between November 2019 and October 2020. They presented with long-term non-healing wounds caused by M. abscessus infection after undergoing plastic surgery. Symptoms presented by the three patients included swelling, ulceration, secretion, and pain. After identification of M. abscessus with Ziehl-Neelsen staining and MALDI-TOF MS system, the patients were treated with surgical debridement and clarithromycin. Conclusion: It is important to note that a long-term wound that does not heal, especially after plastic surgery, should raise suspicion for M. abscessus infection. The infection mechanism in these three patients may have been due to exposure to surgical equipment that was not properly sterilized or due to poor sterile technique by the plastic surgeon. To prevent such infections, it is important to ensure proper sterilization of surgical equipment and saline.","Shen, Hw; Zhang, Qm; Peng, L; Ma, W; Guo, Jd",10.2147/CCID.S445175,Clinical Cosmetic And Investigational Dermatology
The Impact Of Postoperative Antibiotic And Duration After Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction On Resistance Among Cultured Species,"BackgroundThere is a growing presence of literature within plastic surgery that establishes best practice for postoperative antibiotics after implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR), although it has not been widely adopted or translated into clinical practice. This study aims to determine how antibiotic and duration affects patient outcomes. We hypothesize that IBBR patients who receive a longer duration of postoperative antibiotics will demonstrate higher rates of antibiotic resistance as compared with the institutional antibiogram.MethodsA retrospective chart review included patients who underwent IBBR between 2015 and 2020 at a single institution. Variables of interest included patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical techniques, infectious complications, and antibiograms. Groups were classified by antibiotic (cephalexin, clindamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and duration (& LE;7 days, 8-14 days, and >14 days).ResultsThere were a total of 70 patients who experienced infections included in this study. Onset of infection did not differ based on antibiotic during either device implantation (postexpander P = 0.391; postimplant P = 0.234). Antibiotic and duration did not have an established relationship with explantation rate either (P = 0.154). In patients who had Staphylococcus aureus isolated, there was significantly increased resistance to clindamycin when compared with the institutional antibiogram (sensitivities of 43% and 68%, respectively).ConclusionsNeither antibiotic nor duration displayed a difference in overall patient outcomes, including explantation rates. In this cohort, S. aureus strains isolated in association with IBBR infections demonstrated a higher level of resistance to clindamycin compared with strains isolated and tested within the broader institution.","Driscoll, Cr; Grosser, Ja; Davidson, Al; Lloyd, Km; Prabhu, Ss; Katz, Aj",10.1097/SAP.0000000000003451,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Effective Paclitaxel: Β-Cyclodextrin-Based Formulation Boosts In Vitro Anti-Tumor Potential And Lowers Toxicity In Zebrafish,"Paclitaxel (PCTX) is one of the most prevalently used chemotherapeutic agents. However, its use is currently beset with a host of problems: solubility issue, microplastic leaching, and drug resistance. Since drug discovery is challenging, we decided to focus on repurposing the drug itself by remedying its drawbacks and making it more effective. In this study, we have harnessed the aqueous solubility of sugars, and the high affinity of cancer cells for them, to entrap the hydrophobic PCTX within the hydrophilic shell of the carbohydrate beta-cyclodextrin. We have characterized this novel drug formulation by testing its various physical and chemical parameters. Importantly, in all our in vitro assays, the conjugate performed better than the drug alone. We find that the conjugate is internalized by the cancer cells (A549) via caveolin 1-mediated endocytosis. Thereafter, it triggers apoptosis by inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. Based on experiments on zebrafish larvae, the formulation displays lower toxicity compared to PCTX alone. Thus, our Trojan Horse approach, relying on minimal components and relatively faster formulation, enhances the anti-tumor potential of PCTX, while simultaneously making it more innocuous toward non-cancerous cells. The findings of this study have implications in the quest for the most cost-effective chemotherapeutic molecule.

Eml4-Alk Fusions Drive Lung Adeno-To-Squamous Transition Through Jak-Stat Activation,"Through integrative analyses of mouse models and clinical data, Qin et al. find that certain ALK-rearranged LUAD hold the potential toward squamous transition. Such phenotypic transition associates with TKI resistance and relies on the JAK-STAT signaling. Human lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma (LUAS), containing both adenomatous and squamous pathologies, exhibits strong cancer plasticity. We find that ALK rearrangement is detectable in 5.1-7.5% of human LUAS, and transgenic expression of EML4-ALK drives lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) formation initially and squamous transition at late stage. We identify club cells as the main cell-of-origin for squamous transition. Through recapitulating lineage transition in organoid system, we identify JAK-STAT signaling, activated by EML4-ALK phase separation, significantly promotes squamous transition. Integrative study with scRNA-seq and immunostaining identify a plastic cell subpopulation in ALK-rearranged human LUAD showing squamous biomarker expression. Moreover, those relapsed ALK-rearranged LUAD show notable upregulation of squamous biomarkers. Consistently, mouse squamous tumors or LUAD with squamous signature display certain resistance to ALK inhibitor, which can be overcome by combined JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment. This study uncovers strong plasticity of ALK-rearranged tumors in orchestrating phenotypic transition and drug resistance and proposes a potentially effective therapeutic strategy.","Qin, Z; Yue, Mt; Tang, Sj; Wu, Fy; Sun, Hh; Li, Y; Zhang, Yc; Izumi, H; Huang, Hy; Wang, Wy; Xue, Y; Tong, Xy; Mori, S; Taki, T; Goto, K; Jin, Yj; Li, F; Li, Fm; Gao, Yj; Fang, Zy; Fang, Ys; Hu, L; Yan, Xm; Xu, Gl; Chen, Hq; Kobayashi, Ss; Ventura, A; Wong, Kk; Zhu, Xl; Chen, L; Ren, Sx; Chen, Ln; Ji, Hb",10.1084/jem.20232028,Journal Of Experimental Medicine
Antibiotic Prophylaxis And Resistance In Surgical Site Infection After Immediate Tissue Expander Reconstruction Of The Breast,"Background: A recent survey of plastic surgeons showed that the majority prescribed prophylactic antibiotics after hospital discharge for breast reconstruction. There is no clinical evidence that this practice reduces surgical site infection (SSI) after immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction. Furthermore, multiple studies have suggested that current antibiotic choices may not be appropriately covering the causative organisms of SSI. Methods: An institutional breast reconstruction database from January 2005 to December 2011 was queried to identify patients undergoing immediate tissue expander reconstruction of the breast. The bacteriology of the infection, prophylactic and empiric antibiotic use, and antibiotic sensitivities were analyzed. Results: In 557 cases of immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction performed in 378 patients, SSIs were diagnosed in 50 (9.0%) cases. Two hundred patients were given oral antibiotics at discharge; 178 did not receive antibiotics. Surgical site infection developed in 12.0% of patients given oral antibiotics and in 13.5% of those not receiving antibiotics (P = 0.67). Wound culture data were obtained in 34 SSIs. Twenty-nine had positive cultures. The most common offending organisms were methicillin-sensitive (11) and methicillin-resistant (6) Staphylococcus aureus. Despite increased use of postoperative prophylaxis over the years, SSI incidence remained unchanged. However, trends toward increased resistance of SSI organisms to the preoperative and postoperative prophylaxis agents were observed. When first-generation cephalosporins were used as prophylaxis, SSI organisms showed resistance rates of 20.5% (preoperative cefazolin) and 54.5% (postoperative cephalexin). Conclusions: Administration of extended prophylactic antibiotics does not reduce overall risk of SSI after expander-based breast reconstruction but may influence antibiotic resistance patterns when infections occur. The organisms most commonly responsible for SSI are often resistant to cefazolin.","Mccullough, Mc; Chu, Ck; Duggal, Cs; Losken, A; Carlson, Gw",10.1097/SAP.0000000000000275,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
The Adsorption Of Drugs On Nanoplastics Has Severe Biological Impact,"Micro- and nanoplastics can interact with various biologically active compounds forming aggregates of which the effects have yet to be understood. To this end, it is vital to characterize these aggregates of key compounds and micro- and nanoplastics. In this study, we examined the adsorption of the antibiotic tetracycline on four different nanoplastics, made of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and nylon 6,6 (N66) through chemical computation. Two separate approaches were employed to generate relevant conformations of the tetracycline-plastic complexes. In the first approach, we folded the plastic particle from individual polymer chains in the presence of the drug through multiple separate simulated annealing setups. In the second, more biased, approach, the neat plastic was pre-folded through simulated annealing, and the drug was placed at its surface in multiple orientations. The former approach was clearly superior to the other, obtaining lower energy conformations even with the antibiotic buried inside the plastic particle. Quantum chemical calculations on the structures revealed that the adsorption energies show a trend of decreasing affinity to the drug in the order of N66> PS> PP> PE. In vitro experiments on tetracycline-sensitive cell lines demonstrated that, in qualitative agreement with the calculations, the biological activity of tetracycline drops significantly in the presence of PS particles. Preliminary molecular dynamics simulations on two selected aggregates with each plastic served as first stability test of the aggregates under influence of temperature and in water. We found that all the selected cases persisted in water indicating that the aggregates may be stable also in more realistic environments. In summary, our data show that the interaction of micro- and nanoplastics with drugs can alter drug absorption, facilitate drug transport to new locations, and increase local antibiotic concentrations, potentially attenuating antibiotic effect and at the same time promoting antibiotic resistance.","Dick, L; Batista, Pr; Zaby, P; Manhart, G; Kopatz, V; Kogler, L; Pichler, V; Grebien, F; Bakos, V; Plósz, Bg; Kolev, Nz; Kenner, L; Kirchner, B; Hollóczki, O",10.1038/s41598-024-75785-4,Scientific Reports
Complete Genome Sequence Of Photobacterium Ganghwense C2.2: A New Polyhydroxyalkanoate Production Candidate,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable bioplastics that can be manufactured sustainably and represent a promising green alternative to petrochemical-based plastics. Here, we describe the complete genome of a new marine PHA-producing bacterium-Photobacterium ganghwense (strain C2.2), which we have isolated from the Black Sea seashore. This new isolate is psychrotolerant and accumulates PHA when glycerol is provided as the main carbon source. Transmission electron microscopy, specific staining with Nile Red visualized via epifluorescence microscopy and gas chromatography analysis confirmed the accumulation of PHA. This is the only PHA-producing Photobacterium for which we now have a complete genome sequence, allowing us to investigate the pathways for PHA production and other secondary metabolite synthesis pathways. The de novo assembly genome, obtained using open-source tools, comprises two chromosomes (3.5, 2 Mbp) and a megaplasmid (202 kbp). We identify the entire PHA synthesis gene cluster that encodes a class I PHA synthase, a phasin, a 3-ketothiolase, and an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. No conventional PHA depolymerase was identified in strain C2.2, but a putative lipase with extracellular amorphous PHA depolymerase activity was annotated, suggesting that C2.2 is unable to degrade intracellular PHA. A complete pathway for the conversion of glycerol to acetyl-CoA was annotated, in accordance with its ability to convert glycerol to PHA. Several secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and a low number of genes involved in antibiotic resistance and virulence were also identified, indicating the strain's suitability for biotechnological applications.","Lascu, I; Mereuta, I; Chiciudean, I; Hansen, H; Avramescu, Sm; Tanase, Am; Stoica, I",10.1002/mbo3.1182,Microbiologyopen
"Selective Colonization Of Microplastics, Wood And Glass By Antimicrobial- Resistant And Pathogenic Bacteria","The Plastisphere is a novel niche whereby microbial communities attach to plastic debris, including microplastics. These communities can be distinct from those found in the surrounding environment or those attached to natural substrates and may serve as a reservoir of both pathogenic and antimicrobial- resistant (AMR) bacteria. Owing to the frequent omission of appropriate comparator particles (e.g. natural substrates) in previous studies, there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting the unique risks posed by microplastics in terms of enrichment and spread of AMR pathogens. This study investigated selective colonization by a sewage community on environmentally sampled microplastics with three different polymers, sources and morphologies, alongside natural substrate (wood), inert substrate (glass) and free- living/planktonic community controls.","Stevenson, Em; Rushby-Jones, O; Buckling, A; Cole, M; Lindeque, Pk; Murray, Ak",10.1099/mic.0.001506,Microbiology-Sgm
Environmental Factors Support The Formation Of Specific Bacterial Assemblages On Microplastics,"While the global distribution of microplastics (MP) in the marine environment is currently being critically evaluated, the potential role of MP as a vector for distinct microbial assemblages or even pathogenic bacteria is hardly understood. To gain a deeper understanding, we investigated how different in situ conditions contribute to the composition and specificity of MP-associated bacterial communities in relation to communities on natural particles. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and wooden pellets were incubated for 2 weeks along an environmental gradient, ranging from marine (coastal Baltic Sea) to freshwater (waste water treatment plant, WWTP) conditions. The associated assemblages as well as the water communities were investigated applying high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our setup allowed for the first time to determine MP-dependent and -independent assemblage factors as subject to different environmental conditions in one system. Most importantly, plastic-specific assemblages were found to develop solely under certain conditions, such as lower nutrient concentration and higher salinity, while the bacterial genus Erythrobacter, known for the ability to utilize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), was found specifically on MP across a broader section of the gradient. We discovered no enrichment of potential pathogens on PE or PS; however, the abundant colonization of MP in a WWTP by certain bacteria commonly associated with antibiotic resistance suggests MP as a possible hotspot for horizontal gene transfer. Taken together, our study clarifies that the surrounding environment prevailingly shapes the biofilm communities, but that MP-specific assemblage factors exist. These findings point to the ecological significance of specific MP-promoted bacterial populations in aquatic environments and particularly in plastic accumulation zones.","Oberbeckmann, S; Kreikemeyer, B; Labrenz, M",10.3389/fmicb.2017.02709,Frontiers In Microbiology
Are Antibiotics Needed In Septorhinoplasty? An Evidence-Based Approach,"The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the context of septorhinoplasty (SRP) is a frequently debated topic among plastic surgeons. Most surgeons routinely use antibiotics to prevent the dreaded physical and psychological morbidity of postoperative infections, although this practice is controversial. With antimicrobial resistance becoming a global threat, however, optimizing antibiotic prescribing is essential. The current evidence would suggest that the rate of postoperative infection is low and routine antibiotic use is unnecessary in SRP surgery. Rates range from 0.5 to 2% in simple SRP surgery, majority of which are minor nasal infections which respond to oral antibiotics and do not require hospital admission. In cases of complex SRP, defined as revision cases or where grafts or implants have been utilized, infection rates can be much higher with an incidence of 7 to 11%, and as such utilization of antibiotics is reasonable. When considering the regime to be utilized, a single preoperative dose of intravenous antibiotics has the same efficacy in reducing the incident of postoperative infection as a postoperative 7-day course of oral antibiotics. In the authors' practice, all patients receive a single intravenous dose of antibiotics on induction, and in the case of utilization of a graft from a nonnasal site, this is complimented with an oral course of postoperative antibiotics. With this approach, infections rates are at the lowest range of available published literature.","Mantelakis, A; Argiris, K; Joshi, A; D'Souza, Ar",10.1055/a-1920-0876,Facial Plastic Surgery
Staphylococcus Aureus Breast Implant Infection Isolates Display Recalcitrance To Antibiotic Pocket Irrigants,"Breast implant-associated infections (BIAIs) are the primary complication following placement of breast prostheses in breast cancer reconstruction. Given the prevalence of breast cancer, reconstructive failure due to infection results in significant patient distress and health care expenditures. Thus, effective BIAI prevention strategies are urgently needed. This study tests the efficacy of one infection prevention strategy: the use of a triple antibiotic pocket irrigant (TAPI) against Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of BIAIs. TAPI, which consists of 50,000 U bacitracin, 1 g cefazolin, and 80mg gentamicin diluted in 500mL of saline, is used to irrigate the breast implant pocket during surgery. We used in vitro and in vivo assays to test the efficacy of each antibiotic in TAPI, as well as TAPI at the concentration used during surgery. We found that planktonically grown S. aureus BIAI isolates displayed susceptibility to gentamicin, cefazolin, and TAPI. However, TAPI treatment enhanced biofilm formation of BIAI strains. Furthermore, we compared TAPI treatment of a S. aureus reference strain (JE2) to a BIAI isolate (117) in a mouse BIAI model. TAPI significantly reduced infection of JE2 at 1 and 7 days postinfection (dpi). In contrast, BIAI strain 117 displayed high bacterial burdens in tissues and implants, which persisted to 14 dpi despite TAPI treatment. Lastly, we demonstrated that TAPI was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa reference (PAO1) and BIAI strains in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data suggest that S. aureus BIAI strains employ unique mechanisms to resist antibiotic prophylaxis treatment and promote chronic infection. IMPORTANCE The incidence of breast implant associated infections (BIAIs) following reconstructive surgery postmastectomy remains high, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotic strategies. Thus, surgeons have begun using additional antibiotic-based prevention strategies, including triple antibiotic pocket irrigants (TAPIs). However, these strategies fail to reduce BIAI rates for these patients. To understand why these therapies fail, we assessed the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus strains, the most common cause of BIAI, to the antibiotics in TAPI (bacitracin, cefazolin, and gentamicin). We found that while clinically relevant BIAI isolates were more susceptible to the individual antibiotics compared to a reference strain, TAPI was effective at killing all the strains in vitro. However, in a mouse model, the BIAI isolates displayed recalcitrance to TAPI, which contrasted with the reference strain, which was susceptible. These data suggest that strains causing BIAI may encode specific recalcitrance mechanisms not present within reference strains.","Ramirez, Jmd; Gomez, J; Hanson, Bm; Isa, T; Myckatyn, Tm; Walker, Jn",10.1128/spectrum.02884-22,Microbiology Spectrum
Evaluation Of Pathogen Distribution And Antimicrobial Resistance In Breast Plastic Surgery Infection,"BackgroundThe demand for mammaplasty has increased in recent years, and infection remains one of the common and serious post-operative complications. In this study, we analyzed the pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of breast plastic surgery infections, and compared the differences in pathogenic species between surgical procedures. MethodsThe number of each species was counted in the microbial samples of breast plastic surgery infections in Plastic Surgery Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2011 to December 2021. The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing data were analyzed using WHONET 5.6 software. The surgical techniques, the period of infection, and other details were gathered in accordance with the clinical data. ResultsThere were a total of 42 cases included, and 43 different types of pathogenic bacteria, mostly gram-positive bacteria, were found. CoNS (13/43) and Staphylococcus aureus (22/43) made up the majority. The most prevalent of the five Gram-negative bacteria was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results of drug sensitivity tests indicate that S. aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin, cotrimoxazole, and linezolid, whereas CoNS is highly sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, and chloramphenicol. Both of these bacteria show high resistance to erythromycin and penicillin. Breast augmentation, breast reconstruction, and breast reduction surgery were the most frequently associated breast surgery procedures in this study with infections, with the highest number of infections occurring following breast augmentation with fat grafting, breast reduction surgery, and breast reconstruction with autologous tissue. Various breast plastic surgery procedures have different common pathogens of infection, but the most prevalent are CoNS and S. aureus. Additionally, the majority of the infections in this study were in the early stages. ConclusionsGram-positive bacteria were the predominant cause of breast plastic surgery infections, and the types of infection strains, the period of infection onset, and the antibiotic susceptibility of prevalent strains varied between breast plastic procedures.","Su, Xs; Hu, Jt; Jiang, Fl; Wu, Yy; He, Jj; Jia, Xm; Zhan, S",10.1111/jocd.15919,Journal Of Cosmetic Dermatology
Culturing The Plastisphere: Comparing Methods To Isolate Culturable Bacteria Colonising Microplastics,"Microplastics quickly become colonised by diverse microbial communities, known as the Plastisphere. There is growing concern that microplastics may support the enrichment and spread of pathogenic or antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, although research to support the unique role of microplastics in comparison to control particles remains inconclusive. Limitations to this research include the microbiological methods available for isolating adhered microbes. Culture-based methods provide some of the most established, accessible and cost-effective microbiological protocols, which could be extremely useful in helping to address some of the remaining key questions in Plastisphere research. Previous works have successfully cultured bacteria from plastics, but these have not yet been reviewed, nor compared in efficiency. In this study, we compared four common biofilm extraction methods (swabbing, sonication, vortexing, sonication followed by vortexing) to extract and culture a mixed community of bacteria from both microplastic (polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene) and control (wood and glass) particles. Biofilm extraction efficiency and viability of bacterial suspension was determined by comparing CFU/mL of four different groups of bacteria. This was verified against optical density and 16S rRNA qPCR. Overall, we found that all tested methods were able to remove biofilms, but to varying efficiencies. Sonicating particles with glass beads for 15 min, followed by vortexing for a further minute, generated the highest yield and therefore greatest removal efficiency of culturable, biofilm-forming bacteria.","Stevenson, Em; Buckling, A; Cole, M; Lindeque, Pk; Murray, Ak",10.3389/fmicb.2023.1259287,Frontiers In Microbiology
Adhesion And Biofilm Formation By Staphylococcus Aureus Clinical Isolates Under Conditions Relevant To The Host: Relationship With Macrolide Resistance And Clonal Lineages,"Purpose. Staphylococcus aureus isolates, collected from various clinical samples, were analysed to evaluate the contribution of the genetic background of both erythromycin-resistant (ERSA) and -susceptible (ESSA) S. aureus strains to biofilm formation. Methods. A total of 66 ESSA and 43 ERSA clinical isolates were studied for adhesiveness and biofilm formation under different atmospheres. All isolates were evaluated for phenotypic and genotypic macrolide resistance, and for clonal relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and by spa typing on representative isolates. Results. A high genetic heterogeneity was encountered, although 10 major PFGE types accounted for 86% with a few small spatially and temporally related clusters. Overall, biofilm formation under anoxia was significantly lower than under oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres. Biofilm formation by ESSA was significantly higher compared to ERSA under oxic and micro-aerophilic conditions. Adhesiveness to plastic was significantly higher among respiratory tract infection isolates under micro-aerophilic conditions, while surgical site infection isolates formed significantly higher biomass of biofilm under oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres compared to anoxia. Pulsotype 2 and 4 strains formed significantly higher biofilm biomass than pulsotype 1, with strains belonging to CC8 forming significantly more compared to those belonging to CC5, under both oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres. Conclusions. S. aureus biofilm formation appears to be more efficient in ESSA than ERSA, associated with specific S. aureus lineages, mainly CC8 and CC15, and affected by atmosphere. Further studies investigating the relationship between antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation could prove useful in the development of new strategies for the management of S. aureus infections.","Di Bonaventura, G; Pompilio, A; Monaco, M; De Araujo, Fp; Baldassarri, L; Pantosti, A; Gherardi, G",10.1099/jmm.0.000893,Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Nasopharyngeal Carriage And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Patterns Of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Among Children Under Five In Southwest Ethiopia,"Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae is found to play an important role in the development and transmission of pneumococcal diseases. In this study, we assessed the nasopharyngeal carriage, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and associated risk factors of S. pneumoniae among children under five. A total of 361 children under five attending the outpatient department of Shanan Gibe Hospital in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia were enrolled from June to September 2014. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected using sterile plastic applicator rayon tipped swab and inoculated on tryptone soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood and 5 mu g/mL gentamycin. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the modified disk diffusion method. The overall prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage was 43.8% (158/361) among children under five. Resistance to tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, penicillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin was observed in 53.2% (84/158), 43.7% (69/158), 36.1% (57/158), 13.3% (21/158) and 8.9% (14/158) of isolates respectively. Multidrug resistance was seen in 17.7% (28/158) of isolates. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, children living with sibling(s) < 5 years old (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.798; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.169-2.766) and malnutrition (AOR = 2.065; 95% CI, 1.239-3.443) were significantly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage. A high nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae was observed among children under five in Southwest Ethiopia. There should be a strategy to prevent S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal colonization and identify the appropriate antibiotic to the individual child.","Gebre, T; Tadesse, M; Aragaw, D; Feye, D; Beyene, Hb; Seyoum, D; Mekonnen, M",10.3390/children4040027,Children-Basel
Critical Review: Propensity Of Premise Plumbing Pipe Materials To Enhance Or Diminish Growth Of Legionella And Other Opportunistic Pathogens,"Growth of Legionella pneumophila and other opportunistic pathogens (OPs) in drinking water premise plumbing poses an increasing public health concern. Premise plumbing is constructed of a variety of materials, creating complex environments that vary chemically, microbiologically, spatially, and temporally in a manner likely to influence survival and growth of OPs. Here we systematically review the literature to critically examine the varied effects of common metallic (copper, iron) and plastic (PVC, cross-linked polyethylene (PEX)) pipe materials on factors influencing OP growth in drinking water, including nutrient availability, disinfectant levels, and the composition of the broader microbiome. Plastic pipes can leach organic carbon, but demonstrate a lower disinfectant demand and fewer water chemistry interactions. Iron pipes may provide OPs with nutrients directly or indirectly, exhibiting a high disinfectant demand and potential to form scales with high surface areas suitable for biofilm colonization. While copper pipes are known for their antimicrobial properties, evidence of their efficacy for OP control is inconsistent. Under some circumstances, copper's interactions with premise plumbing water chemistry and resident microbes can encourage growth of OPs. Plumbing design, configuration, and operation can be manipulated to control such interactions and health outcomes. Influences of pipe materials on OP physiology should also be considered, including the possibility of influencing virulence and antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, all known pipe materials have a potential to either stimulate or inhibit OP growth, depending on the circumstances. This review delineates some of these circumstances and informs future research and guidance towards effective deployment of pipe materials for control of OPs.","Cullom, Ac; Martin, Rl; Song, Y; Williams, K; Williams, A; Pruden, A; Edwards, Ma",10.3390/pathogens9110957,Pathogens
Early Detection Of Metallo-Β-Lactamase Ndm-1-And Oxa-23 Carbapenemase-Producing Acinetobacter Baumannii In Libyan Hospitals,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen causing various nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to characterise the molecular support of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii clinical isolates recovered from two Libyan hospitals. Bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods, and carbapenem resistance determinants were studied by PCR amplification and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for typing of the isolates. All 36 imipenem-resistant isolates tested were identified as A. baumannii. The bla(OXA-23) gene was detected in 29 strains (80.6%). The metallo-beta-lactamase bla(NDM-1) gene was detected in eight isolates (22.2%), showing dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in Tripoli Medical Center and Burn and Plastic Surgery Hospital in Libya, including one isolate that co-expressed the bla(OXA-23) gene. MLST revealed several sequence types (STs). Imipenem-resistant A. baumannii ST2 was the predominant clone (16/36; 44.4%). This study shows that NDM-1 and OXA-23 contribute to antibiotic resistance in Libyan hospitals and represents the first incidence of the association of these two carbapenemases in an autochthonous MDR A. baumannii isolated from patients in Libya, indicating that there is a longstanding infection control problem in these hospitals.

Flap Reconstruction For Deep Sternal Wound Infections: Factors Influencing Morbidity And Mortality,"Background. Deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) often require flap reconstruction to obliterate dead space and provide healthy soft tissue coverage. A better understanding of risk factors for complications after DSWI flap reconstruction may improve operative management. Methods. A retrospective study (2007-2018) was conducted of all patients with DSWI after cardiothoracic procedure referred to a single reconstructive surgeon for flap reconstruction. Patient and operative factors were reviewed, including procedure types and outcomes. Predictors of morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed. Results. A total of 119 patients requiring flap reconstruction for DSWI met inclusion criteria. Unilateral (49.6%) or bilateral (40.3%) pectoralis muscle flaps were performed most frequently, followed by vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) (4.2%), omental (4.2%), and omental/pectoralis flap combination (1.7%). Superficial surgical site infection (SSI) was the predominant postoperative complication (17.6%). Debridement/revisional procedures were required in 19 patients (16%), and flap failure occurred in 5 (4.2%). Overall 30-day mortality was 15.1%. End-stage renal disease (P = .002), congestive heart failure (P = .049), low albumin (P = .004), cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = .0001), need for open chest (P = .020), and high American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (P = .003) were associated with higher mortality. By multivariate analysis, multidrug resistance was predictive of any postoperative complication (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-23.2; P = .018), VRAM was predictive of SSI (OR, 9.6; 95% CI, 1.4-66.4; P = .022), and end-stage renal disease (OR, 8.57; 95% CI, 1.06-69.1; P = .044) was predictive of higher mortality. Conclusions. Pectoralis muscle flaps are the workhorse for complex sternal wound coverage, but complications after flap reconstruction for DSWIs remain high. In particular, end-stage renal disease, VRAM reconstruction, and multidrug-resistant infection may predict a complicated postoperative course in these patients.

Increase In Gray Matter Volume And White Matter Fractional Anisotropy In The Motor Pathways Of Patients With Secondarily Generalized Neocortical Seizures,"Purpose: Convulsive motor activity is a clinical manifestation of secondarily generalized seizures evolving from different focal regions. The way in which the motor seizures present themselves is not very different from most of the generalized seizures in and between epilepsy patients. This might point towards the involvement of motor related cortices and corticospinal pathway for wide spread propagation of epileptic activity. Our aim was to identify changes in the cerebral structures and to correlate clinical variables with structural changes particularly in the motor-related cortices and pathway of patients with generalized convulsions from different seizure foci. Methods: Sixteen patients with focal onset and secondarily generalized seizures were included, along with sixteen healthy volunteers. Structural differences were analysed by measuring grey matter (GM) volume and thickness via T1-weighted MRI, and white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) via diffusion tensor imaging. GM and WM microstructural properties were compared between patients and controls by voxel- and surface-based analyses. Next, morphometric findings were correlated with seizure severity and disease duration to identify the pathologic process. Key findings: In addition to widely reduced GM and WM properties, increased GM volume in the bilateral precentral gyri and paracentral lobules, and elevated regional FA in the bilateral corticospinal tracts adjacent to these motor-related GM were observed in patients and with higher statistical difference in the sub-patient group with drug-resistance. Significance: The increment of GM volume and WM FA in the motor pathway positively correlated with severity and duration of epilepsy. The demonstrated microstructural changes of motor pathways imply a plastic process of motor networks in the patients with frequent generalization of focal seizures.","Hsin, Yl; Harnod, T; Chang, Cs; Peng, Sj",10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.09.011,Epilepsy Research
Investigation Of The Effect Of Microplastics On The Uv Inactivation Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Water,"This study investigated the effect of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics on the UV fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug-resistant E. coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at pH 6.0 + 0.1. In the absence of microplastics, the UV inactivation of the studied bacteria exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation of free (dispersed) bacteria, while in the presence of microplastics, these 2 regimes were followed by an additional regime of slower or no inactivation related to micmplastic-associated bacteria (i.e., bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from UV indicated by tailing at higher UV fluences). The magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics varied with different microplastics (type/particle size) and bacteria (Gram-negative and Gram-positive). Results showed that when the UV transmittance of the micmplastic-containing water was not taken into account in calculating UV fluences, the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated. A UV fluence-based double-exponential microbial inactivation model accounting for both free and microplastic-associated bacteria could describe well the disinfection data. The present study elucidated the effect of microplastics on the performance of UV disinfection, and the approach used herein to prove this concept may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of other particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfection processes in different water and wastewater matrices.","Manoli, K; Naziri, A; Ttofi, I; Michael, C; Allan, Ij; Fatta-Kassinos, D",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118906,Water Research
"Microbial Keratitis In Thyroid Eye Disease: Clinical Features, Microbiological Profile, And Treatment Outcome","Microbial Keratitis occurs in 1.3% cases of Thyroid Eye Disease. It is more common in men, and in active disease. The microbiological spectrum and possible clinical risk factors are presented. Purpose: To report the incidence, clinical features, microbiologic profile, and risk indicators in the development of microbial keratitis in Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). Methods: All patients who were diagnosed to have TED and developed microbial keratitis between the years 2009 to 2017 at the Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery service, LV Prasad Eye Institute were included in this retrospective interventional study. The clinical features, microbiological profile, and treatment outcome of the infection were studied. Possible risk factors leading to the development of microbial keratitis were studied. Results: A total of 1,000 patients of TED were evaluated in the 10-year period. Of the 1,000, 13 patients (14 eyes, 1.4%) were diagnosed with microbial keratitis. The average age at presentation was 44 years (range 1969 years). Of the 13 patients, 10 (77%) were men, 12 (92%) were hyperthyroid, and 12 (92%) were active (average clinical activity score 3) at presentation. Average exophthalmometry value in the involved eye was 24.75mm, and severe eyelid retraction (>2mm scleral show) was noted in 13 of 14 eyes. None of the patients had optic nerve compression. Moderate motility restriction (2 in all gazes) was noted in 6 eyes, and severe motility restriction (4 in all gazes) in 8 eyes. At presentation, 11 (85%) had visual acuity of counting fingers at 1 meter or less, The mean follow up from the time of presentation was 18.3 months (range 566 months). Majority of the eyes (8/14) presented with severe infection (panophthalmitis with microbial keratits = 1, total corneal infiltrate with/without melt = 4, severe thinning/perforation = 4). Microbiological work up of 14 eyes revealed presence of gram-negative bacteria in 5 eyes which included Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., and Acinetobacter sp., and gram-positive bacteria in 4 eyes including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., and Staphylococcus sp. Three eyes revealed a mixed infection of E. coli with Alternaria sp, and E. coli with Corynebacterioum amycolatum while 1 had Corynebacterium pseudodiptheriticum, and S. pneumoniae. Two eyes of the bilateral case showed no growth. Antibiotic susceptibility revealed 6 of the 7 gram-negative isolates were multidrug resistant, whereas the gram-positive isolates were susceptible to most drugs tested. Surgical procedures required were tarsorrhaphy in 7 eyes, tissue adhesive with bandage contact lens in 4, evisceration in 4, levator recession in 2, 3-wall orbital decompression in 2, and penetrating keratoplasty in 1 eye. The visual acuity at presentation was counting fingers or worse in 10/14 eyes. Posttreatment, 10 eyes achieved resolution of infiltrate (with visual improvement in 2), and 4 required evisceration. Conclusions: In the authors large series of TED, microbial keratitis was noted in 1.3% of patients presenting to a tertiary eye center. Majority presented with advanced diseases and ended with a poor outcome. Gram-negative isolates showed multidrug resistance. An association with early phase of active TED (CAS 3 or more), severe eyelid retraction, and moderate-severe motility restriction is suggested.","Naik, Mn; Vasanthapuram, Vh; Joseph, J; Murthy, Si",10.1097/IOP.0000000000001361,Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Synergistic Toxic Mechanisms Of Microplastics And Triclosan Via Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Inhibition-Mediated Autophagy In The Freshwater Water Flea Daphnia Magna,"Since a mixed state of environmental contaminants, including microplastics (MPs), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs), exists in aquatic ecosystems, it is necessary to evaluate not only the adverse effects of exposure to a single stressor but to combined stressors. In this study, we exposed the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna to 2 & mu;m MPs and triclosan (TCS), one of PPCPs, for 48 h to investigate the synergistic toxic consequences of simultaneous exposure to both pollutants. We measured in vivo endpoints, antioxidant responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and autophagy-related protein expression via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. While MPs single exposure did not show toxic effects in water fleas, simultaneous exposure to TCS and MPs was associated with significantly greater deleterious effects in the form of increased mortality and alterations in antioxidant enzymatic activities compared with water fleas exposed to TCS alone. In addition, MXR inhibition was confirmed by measurement of the expression of P-glycoproteins and multidrug-resistance proteins in MPsexposed groups, which led to the accumulation of TCS. Overall, these results suggest that simultaneous exposure to MPs and TCS resulted in higher TCS accumulation via MXR inhibition, leading to synergistic toxic effects such as autophagy in D. magna.","Lee, Js; Oh, Y; Park, He; Lee, Js; Kim, Hs",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165214,Science Of The Total Environment
"A Review Of Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma Therapies And Their Mechanisms, From Immunotherapies To Lysine Histone Methyl Transferase Inhibitors","Simple Summary Advanced cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer and has variable rates of treatment response. Currently, there are some classes of immunotherapy and target therapies for its treatment. Immunotherapy can inhibit tumor growth and its recurrence by triggering the host's immune system, whereas targeted therapy inhibits specific molecules or signaling pathways. However, melanoma responses to these treatments are highly heterogeneous, and frequently become resistant. Thus, this review article presents newly available therapies and those in development for advanced cutaneous melanoma therapy.Abstract Advanced cutaneous melanoma is considered to be the most aggressive type of skin cancer and has variable rates of treatment response. Currently, there are some classes of immunotherapy and target therapies for its treatment. Immunotherapy can inhibit tumor growth and its recurrence by triggering the host's immune system, whereas targeted therapy inhibits specific molecules or signaling pathways. However, melanoma responses to these treatments are highly heterogeneous, and patients can develop resistance. Epigenomics (DNA/histone modifications) contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Epigenetic alterations are divided into four levels of gene expression regulation: DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation. Deregulation of lysine methyltransferase enzymes is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, development of metastases, changes in the immune microenvironment, and drug resistance. The study of lysine histone methyltransferase (KMT) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) inhibitors is important for understanding cancer epigenetic mechanisms and biological processes. In addition to immunotherapy and target therapy, the research and development of KMT and NNMT inhibitors is ongoing. Many studies are exploring the therapeutic implications and possible side effects of these compounds, in addition to their adjuvant potential to the approved current therapies. Importantly, as with any drug development, safety, efficacy, and specificity are crucial considerations when developing methyltransferase inhibitors for clinical applications. Thus, this review article presents the recently available therapies and those in development for advanced cutaneous melanoma therapy.","De Oliveira, Rs; De Oliveira, Da; Nisimoto, Mm; Marti, Lc",10.3390/cancers15245751,Cancers
Mechanistic Concepts Involved In Biofilm Associated Processes Of Campylobacter Jejuni: Persistence And Inhibition In Poultry Environments,"Campylobacter species, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, remains a significant zoonotic pathogen worldwide, with the poultry sector being the primary vector for human transmission. In recent years. there has been a notable rise in the incidence of human campylobacteriosis, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen's survival mechanisms and transmission dynamics. Biofilm presence significantly contributes to C. jejuni persistence in poultry and subsequent food product contamination, and this review describes the intricate processes involved in biofilm formation. The ability of Campylobacter to form biofilms on various surfaces, including stainless steel, plastic, and glass, is a critical survival strategy. Campylobacter biofilms, with their remarkable resilience, protect the pathogen from environmental stresses such as desiccation, pH extremes, biocides and sanitizing agents. This review explores the molecular and genetic mechanisms of C. jejuni biofilm formation, highlighting regulatory genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, and stress responses. Flagellar proteins, particularly flaA, flaB, flaG, and adhesins like cadF and flpA, are identified as the main molecular components in biofilm development. The role of mixed-species biofilms, where C. jejuni integrates into existing biofilms of other bacteria to enhance pathogen resilience, is also discussed. This review also considers alternative interventions to control C. jejuni in poultry production, in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance. It explores the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, bacteriocins, bacteriophages, vaccines, and organic acids, with a focus on their mechanisms of action in reducing bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Studies show that mixtures of organic acids and compounds like Carvacrol and Eugenol significantly downregulate genes linked with motility and adhesion, thereby disrupting biofilm integrity. It discusses the impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and oxygen levels on biofilm formation, providing insights into how industrial conditions can be manipulated to reduce contamination. This paper stresses the need for a multifaceted approach to control Campylobacter in poultry, integrating molecular and genetic insights with practical interventions. By advancing our understanding of biofilm dynamics and gene regulation, we aim to inform the development of more effective strategies to enhance food safety and protect public health.","Bundurus, Ia; Balta, I; Pet, I; Stef, L; Popescu, Ca; Mccleery, D; Lemon, J; Callaway, T; Douglas, A; Corcionivoschi, N",10.1016/j.psj.2024.104328,Poultry Science
Exposure To Heavy Metal And Antibiotic Enriches Antibiotic Resistant Genes On The Tire Particles In Soil,"The widespread occurrence of tire particles (IPs) in soils has attracted considerable attention due to their potential threats. The assemblage of bacteria and associated antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) on TPs is yet largely unknown, especially under the stress of soil pollutants. In the present study, TPs were incubated in soils with or without the stress of heavy metal (Cu2+) or/and antibiotic (tetracycline). and bacterial community and ARG profile on TPs and in soils were explored using high-throughput sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR. Results indicated that bacterial community structure on TPs was significantly different from the surrounding soils, with a lower diversity, and significantly shifted by heavy metal and antibiotic exposure. Additionally, a diverse set of ARGs were detected on TPs, and their abundances were significantly increased under the stress of heavy metal and antibiotic, revealing a strong synergistic effect. Moreover, a good fit was observed for the correlation between bacterial community and ARG profile on TPs. Taken together, this study, for the first time, demonstrates that TPs can provide a novel niche for soil bacteria and soil resistome, and heavy metal and antibiotic exposure may potentially increase the abundance of ARGs on TPs, threatening soil ecosystems and human health.

Increased Drug Resistance Of Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Biofilms Formed On A Mouse Dermal Chip Model,"Purpose. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm formation in humans is of serious clinical concern. Previous in vitro studies have been performed with biofilms grown only on inorganic substrates; therefore, we investigated the vancomycin (VCM) resistance of MRSA biofilms grown on skin tissue. Methodology. We established a novel tissue substrate model, namely MRSA grown on segments of mouse skin tissue (dermal chips, DCs), and compared its resistance capacity against VCM with that of MRSA biofilms grown on plastic chips (PCs). Results/Key findings. For one MRSA isolate, we found that the VCM MIC was identical (1.56 mu g ml(-1)) for planktonic cultures and for biofilms-formed on PCs (PC-BF), although the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) increased to 6.25 mu g ml(-1) in PC-BF. On the contrary, the MIC and MBC for biofilms formed on DCs (DC-BF) significantly increased (25 and 50 mu g ml(-1), respectively). Furthermore, the minimum biofilm-eradicating concentration was higher for DC-BF (100 mu g ml(-1)) than for PC-BF (25 mu g ml(-1)). Using six MRSA strains, we found that in PC-BF, the c.f.u. number decreased with increasing VCM concentration, whereas in DC-BF, it greatly increased until the MIC was reached, accompanied by the formation of large colonies, thicker bacterial walls and the presence of many mitotic cells. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the VCM resistance of MRSA was greater in DC-BF. We conclude that DCs may provide a specific environment for MRSA that enhances bacterial growth under cytotoxic VCM concentrations, and might be useful for the study of skin wound infections and the effects of antimicrobial drugs.","Jimi, S; Miyazaki, M; Takata, T; Ohjimi, H; Akita, S; Hara, S",10.1099/jmm.0.000461,Journal Of Medical Microbiology
The Role Of Topical Antibiotic Prophylaxis In Oculofacial Plastic Surgery A Randomized Controlled Study,"Purpose: The usefulness of topical antibiotic prophylaxis for routine oculofacial plastic surgery is not well established. Given concerns such as contact dermatitis, antibiotic resistance, and healthcare costs in conjunction with a low baseline rate of surgical site infections, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of infection with and without the use of topical antibiotic prophylaxis. Design: Randomized, controlled, unmasked clinical trial. Participants: Adult patients undergoing routine periocular surgery without prior history of periocular surgical site infection, need for perioperative oral or parenteral antibiotics, or allergy to all study medications. Methods: Participants were randomized before surgery to receive either antibiotic or placebo (mineral oil and petrolatum-based) ointment after surgery. Outcomes were measured at the first postoperative visit. The 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to compare outcomes between groups. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infections. The secondary outcomes included stratification of infections by patient risk characteristics, incidence of allergic contact dermatitis, and incidence of wound complications. Results: Four hundred one participants were enrolled and randomized, and 13 participants did not proceed with surgery or were lost to follow-up. High-risk features for infection were identified in 24% of the placebo group and 21% of the antibiotic group. Surgical site infections were more common in the placebo group (2.7% vs. 0.0%; P = 0.025). The rate of contact dermatitis was similar (0.5% vs. 0.5%; P = 1.00), as was the rate of wound dehiscence (2.7% vs. 3.5%; P = 0.77). Among the placebo group, the incidence of infections in the low-and highrisk participants was 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively. Infections were treated with oral or topical antibiotics and resolved without complication, except in 1 patient who required 2 subsequent surgeries to address the sequelae. Conclusions: After routine oculofacial plastic surgery, patients treated with a topical antibiotic ointment showed a lower risk of surgical site infection compared with patients treated with a nonantibiotic ointment.

Adaptive Phenotypic Plasticity In Malaria Parasites Is Not Constrained By Previous Responses To Environmental Change,"Background and objectives: Phenotypic plasticity enables organisms to maximize fitness by matching trait values to different environments. Such adaptive phenotypic plasticity is exhibited by parasites, which experience frequent environmental changes during their life cycle, between individual hosts and also in within-host conditions experienced during infections. Life history theory predicts that the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity is limited by costs and constraints, but tests of these concepts are scarce. Methodology: Here, we induce phenotypic plasticity in malaria parasites to test whether mounting a plastic response to an environmental perturbation constrains subsequent plastic responses to further environmental change. Specifically, we perturb red blood cell resource availability to induce Plasmodium chabaudi to alter the trait values of several phenotypes underpinning within-host replication and betweenhost transmission. We then transfer parasites to unperturbed hosts to examine whether constraints govern the parasites' ability to alter these phenotypes in response to their new in-host environment. Results: Parasites alter trait values in response to the within-host environment they are exposed to. We do not detect negative consequences, for within-host replication or between-host transmission, of previously mounting a plastic response to a perturbed within-host environment. Conclusions and implications: We suggest that malaria parasites are highly plastic and adapted to adjusting their phenotypes in response to the frequent changes in the within-host conditions they experience during infections. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that medical interventions, such as anti-parasite drugs, induce plastic responses that are adaptive and can facilitate the survival and potentially, drug resistance of parasites. Lay Summary: Malaria parasites have evolved flexible strategies to cope with the changing conditions they experience during infections. We show that using such flexible strategies does not impact upon the parasites' ability to grow (resulting in disease symptoms) or transmit (spreading the disease).","Birget, Plg; Schneider, P; O'Donnell, Aj; Reece, Se",10.1093/emph/eoz028,Evolution Medicine And Public Health
Effects Of Microplastics (Mps) And Tributyltin (Tbt) Alone And In Combination On Bile Acids And Gut Microbiota Crosstalk In Mice,"Microplastics (MPs) and tributyltin (TBT) are both potential environmental pollutants that enter organisms through the food chain and affect bodily functions. However, the effects and mechanisms of MPs and TBT exposure (especially the co-exposure of both pollutants) on mammals remain unclear. In this study, CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF5 mu m MPs (5MP) was administered alone or in combination with TBT to investigate the health risk of oral exposure in mice. All three treatments induced inflammation in the liver, altered gut microbiota composition and disturbed fecal bile acids profiles. In addition to decreasing triglyceride (TG) and increasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and macrophage-expressed gene 1 (Mpeg1), 5MP induced hepatic cholestasis by stimulating the expression of the cholesterol hydroxylase enzymes CYP8B1 and CYP27A1, and inhibiting multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 3 (MRP2, MRP3), and bile-salt export pump (BSEP) to prevent bile acids for entering the blood and bile. Correspondingly, 5MP treatment decreased 7-ketolithocholic acid (7-ketoLCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA), which were positively correlated with decreased Bacteroides and Marvinbryantia and negatively correlated with increased Bifidobacterium. In addition, TBT increased interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and Mpeg1 levels to induce inflammation, accompanied by decreased 7-ketoLCA, tauro-alpha-muricholic acid (T-alpha-MCA) and alpha-muricholic acid (alpha-MCA) levels, which were negatively related to Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 and Bifidobacterium. Coexposure to 5MP and TBT also decreased TG and induced bile acids accumulation in the liver due to inhibited BSEP, which might be attributed to the co-regulation of decreased T-alpha-MCA and Harryflintia. In conclusion, the administration of 5MP and TBT alone and in combination could cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and subsequently alter bile acids profiles, while the combined exposure of 5MP and TBT weakened the toxic effects of 5MP and TBT alone.","Jiang, P; Yuan, Gh; Jiang, Br; Zhang, Jy; Wang, Yq; Lv, Hj; Zhang, Z; Wu, Jl; Wu, Q; Li, L",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112345,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Meta-Analysis Reveals Differential Impacts Of Microplastics On Soil Biota,"Contamination of microplastics (MPs) is a global environmental issue that has received much attention from the scientific and public communities due to ecological concerns in recent decades. Comparing with aquatic ecosystems, soil systems, regardless of the high importance and complexity, have been less studied under widely existing and increasing MP contamination. This review, combined with data assimilation and meta-analysis methods, has summarized current contamination conditions of soil MPs across different sites reported in earlier studies. While performing this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of MPs on soil biota including their numbers, biomass, diversity, and physiological properties. The results showed that abundance of soil MPs ranged from 0.34 to 410958.9 items kg(-1) and concentration ranged from 0.002 to 67500 mg kg(-1) across sites, with agricultural soils containing significantly lower abundance and concentration of MPs than others. Presence of MPs significantly decreased the individual number of soil biota, operational taxonomic unit, diversity index (Simpson), movement index and reproduction rate, whereas the mortality rate was significantly increased by the soil MPs. Despite these significant effects, MPs did not significantly alter the biomass of soil biota, which could be due to a counteraction of their negative and positive effects on different groups of soil organisms. Moreover, we observed that soil MPs could significantly increase the Chao1 index, suggesting that MPs may act as a food resource for the soil rare biosphere. Based on the existing knowledge, we suggest that future studies should focus on research areas that include but are not limited to methodological improvements, intensive field investigations, risk assessment from the perspective of soil food web and bioaccumulation, MPs induced antibiotic resistance, and restoration strategies to reduce their concentrations in soil.","Wei, H; Wu, Lz; Liu, Zq; Saleem, M; Chen, X; Xie, Jf; Zhang, Je",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113150,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
"A Preliminary Study Of The Cultivable Microbiota On The Plastic Litter Collected By Commercial Fishing Trawlers In The South-Eastern Adriatic Sea, With Emphasis On Vibrio Isolates And Their Antibiotic Resistance","Mediterranean Sea is the sixth largest area of marine litter accumulation in the world, and plastic pollution is a growing problem in its Adriatic sub-basin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cultivable microbiota associated with plastic litter collected by commercial fishing trawlers in the south-eastern Adriatic Sea in comparison with microbiota in seawater and sediment. Plastic litter in the sea contains an autochthonous microbiota that is different from that of the surrounding seawater and sediment. Vibrio abundance was higher on plastic litter than in surrounding seawater and sediment. All isolated Vibrio showing resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin, while resistance to other antibiotics depended on the isolated species. Overall, this study provides for the first time information on the cultivable microbiota associated with plastic litter collected by commercial fishing trawlers and provides a data base for further studies.","Kapetanovic, D; Smrzlic, Iv; Kazazic, S; Omanovic, D; Cukrov, N; Cindric, Am; Rapljenovic, A; Peric, L; Orlic, K; Mijosek, T; Redzovic, Z; Gavrilovic, A; Radocaj, T; Marijic, Vf",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114592,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Towards Quantifying Plasmid Similarity,"Plasmids are extrachromosomal replicons which can quickly spread resistance and virulence genes between clinical pathogens. From the tens of thousands of currently available plasmid sequences we know that overall plasmid diversity is structured, with related plasmids sharing a largely conserved 'backbone' of genes while being able to carry very different genetic cargo. Moreover, plasmid genomes can be structurally plastic and undergo frequent rearrangements. So, how can we quantify plasmid similarity? Answering this question requires practical efforts to sample natural variation as well as theoretical considerations of what defines a group of related plasmids. Here we consider the challenges of analysing and rationalising the current plasmid data deluge to define appropriate similarity thresholds.","Matlock, W; Shaw, Lp; Sheppard, Sk; Feil, E",10.1099/mgen.0.001290,Microbial Genomics
Urban Waste Piles Are Reservoirs For Human Pathogenic Bacteria With High Levels Of Multidrug Resistance Against Last Resort Antibiotics: A Comprehensive Temporal And Geographic Field Analysis,"Inadequate waste management and poor sanitation practices in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) leads to waste accumulation in urban and peri-urban residential areas. This increases human exposure to hazardous waste, including plastics, which can harbour pathogenic bacteria. Although lab-based studies demonstrate how plastic pollution can increase the persistence and dissemination of dangerous pathogens, empirical data on pathogen association with plastic in real-world settings are limited. We conducted a year-long spatiotemporal sampling survey in a densely populated informal settlement in Malawi, quantifying enteric bacterial pathogens including ESBL-producing E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio cholerae. Culture-based screening and molecular approaches were used to quantify the presence of each pathogen, together with the distribution and frequency of resistance to antibiotics. Our data indicate that these pathogens commonly associate with urban waste materials. Elevated levels of these pathogens precede typical infection outbreaks, suggesting that urban waste piles may be an important source of community transmission. Notably, many pathogens displayed increased levels of AMR, including against several 'last resort' antibiotics. These findings highlight urban waste piles as potential hotspots for the dissemination of infectious diseases and AMR and underscores the need for urgent waste management interventions to mitigate public health risks.","Mphasa, M; Ormsby, Mj; Mwapasa, T; Nambala, P; Chidziwisano, K; Morse, T; Feasey, N; Quilliam, Rs",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136639,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Mmp3C: An In-Silico Framework To Depict Cancer Metabolic Plasticity Using Gene Expression Profiles,"Metabolic plasticity enables cancer cells to meet divergent demands for tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance. Landscape analysis of tumor metabolic plasticity spanning different cancer types, in particular, metabolic crosstalk within cell subpopulations, remains scarce. Therefore, we proposed a new in-silico framework, termed as (MMPC)-C-3 (Modeling Metabolic Plasticity by Pathway Pairwise Comparison), to depict tumor metabolic plasticity based on transcriptome data. Next, we performed an extensive metabo-plastic analysis of over 6000 tumors comprising 13 cancer types. The metabolic plasticity within distinct cell subpopulations, particularly interplay with tumor microenvironment, were explored at single-cell resolution. Ultimately, the metabo-plastic events were screened out for multiple clinical applications via machine learning methods. The pilot research indicated that 6 out of 13 cancer types exhibited signs of the Warburg effect, implying its high reliability and robustness. Across 13 cancer types, high metabolic organized heterogeneity was found, and four metabo-plastic subtypes were determined, which link to distinct immune and metabolism patterns impacting prognosis. Moreover, (MMPC)-C-3 analysis of approximately 60 000 single cells of eight breast cancer patients unveiled several metabo-plastic events correlated to tumorigenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Notably, the metabolic features screened out by (MMPC)-C-3 are potential biomarkers for diagnosis, tumor classification and prognosis. (MMPC)-C-3 is a practical cross-platform tool to capture tumor metabolic plasticity, and our study unveiled a core set of metabo-plastic pairs among diverse cancer types, which provides bases toward improving response and overcoming resistance in cancer therapy.","Chen, Xy; Deng, M; Wang, Zh; Huang, C",10.1093/bib/bbad471,Briefings In Bioinformatics
Evidence Of Selective Enrichment Of Bacterial Assemblages And Antibiotic Resistant Genes By Microplastics In Urban Rivers,"The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments has recently drawn considerable attention due to their potential threat to the entire ecosystem. The colonization of bacterial communities on microplastics is an important ecological linkage for microplastics in aquatic ecosystems, which is yet poorly understood. In this study, microplastic particles were sampled in two urbanized rivers in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China, and the differences between bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics and planktonic bacteria were estimated. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial communities on microplastics were less rich and diverse compared to those from the freshwater samples, with a significantly distinct taxonomic composition. The predicted functional profiles also indicated significant differences between microplastic and water samples. The functions related to biofilm formation and human diseases were relatively higher for the bacterial communities on the microplastics. Network analyses suggested that microplastic bacterial communities possessed higher average path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity compared to those in water samples. Additionally, quantitative PCR results showed microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), and a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition was observed. The relative abundances of integron-integrase gene classes 1 and 2 were greater on microplastics, potentially suggesting a higher level of horizontal gene transfer. Findings of this study suggested microplastics are a novel microbial niche and may serve as hotspots for microbial interaction, potentially increasing risks to freshwater ecosystems and human health.

Bacterial 'Grounded' Prophages: Hotspots For Genetic Renovation And Innovation,"Bacterial genomes are highly plastic allowing the generation of variants through mutations and acquisition of genetic information. The fittest variants are then selected by the econiche thereby allowing the bacterial adaptation and colonization of the habitat. Larger genomes, however, may impose metabolic burden and hence bacterial genomes are optimized by the loss of frivolous genetic information. The activity of temperate bacteriophages has acute consequences on the bacterial population as well as the bacterial genome through lytic and lysogenic cycles. Lysogeny is a selective advantage as the prophage provides immunity to the lysogen against secondary phage attack. Since the non-lysogens are eliminated by the lytic phages, lysogens multiply and colonize the habitat. Nevertheless, all lysogens have an imminent risk of lytic cycle activation and cell lysis. However, a mutation in the attachment sites or in the genes that encode the specific recombinase responsible for prophage excision could result in 'grounding' of the prophage. Since the lysogens with grounded prophage are immune to respective phage infection as well as dodge the induction of lytic cycle, we hypothesize that the selection of these mutant lysogens is favored relative to their normal lysogenic counterparts. These grounded prophages offer several advantages to the bacterial genome evolution through propensity for genetic variations including inversions, deletions, and insertions via horizontal gene transfer. We propose that the grounded prophages expedite bacterial genome evolution by acting as 'genetic buffer zones' thereby increasing the frequency as well as the diversity of variations on which natural selection favors the beneficial variants. The grounded prophages are also hotspots for horizontal gene transfer wherein several ecologically significant genes such as those involved in stress tolerance, antimicrobial resistance, and novel metabolic pathways, are integrated. Moreover, the high frequency of genetic changes within prophages also allows proportionate probability for the de novo genesis of genetic information. Through sequence analyses of well-characterized E. coli prophages we exemplify various roles of grounded prophages in E. coli ecology and evolution. Therefore, the temperate prophages are one of the most significant drivers of bacterial genome evolution and sites of biogenesis of genetic information.","Ramisetty, Bcm; Sudhakari, Pa",10.3389/fgene.2019.00065,Frontiers In Genetics
"Impact Of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers, Antibiotic Consumption, And Other Measures On Detection Rates Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Rural Japanese Hospitals","There are limited data available on the relationship between multidrug-resistant bacteria and infection control activities in small to medium-sized hospitals. Therefore, we collected data on the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHSs), personal protective equipment, antibiotics, and the levels of detectable bacteria between April 2014 and March 2015 in 11 Japanese hospitals. Average total antibiotic consumption was 100 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days (PD), and average use of ABHSs, masks, plastic aprons, and gloves was 5 L per 1000 PD, and 1, 2, and 26 pieces per 1 PD, respectively. Average numbers of isolated (isolation rate) Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) were 107 (8% of total bacterial tests performed), 51 (4%), and 4 (0.3%), respectively. Multivariate analyses of ABHS and tazobactam/piperacillin consumption showed a significant negative association with the MRSA isolation rate (adjusted R-2 = 0.87). These findings suggest that hand hygiene is more important than antibiotic consumption in small to medium-sized hospitals.

Epidemiology Of Staphylococcus Aureus In A Burn Unit Of A Tertiary Care Center In Ghana,"Background In developing countries, hospitalized burn victims are at high risk of nosocomial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors include poor infection control practices, prolonged hospitalisation and limited capacity for laboratory microbiological analyses. These problems are compounded by widespread use of antibiotics that drives the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria. Methods During the study period (November 2014-June 2015), nasal and invasive S. aureus isolates were collected consecutively from patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) within the burn unit of the Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burn Center of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Antibiotic prescription, antibiotic susceptibility and bacterial typing were used to assess antibiotic pressure, antibiotic resistance, and possible transmission events among patients and HCWs. Results Eighty S. aureus isolates were obtained from 37 of the 62 included burn patients and 13 of the 29 HCWs. At admission, 50% of patients carried or were infected with S. aureus including methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Antibiotic use per 100 days of hospitalization was high (91.2 days), indicating high selective pressure for resistant pathogens. MRSA isolates obtained from 11 patients and one HCW belonged to the same spa-type t928 and multi-locus sequence type 250, implying possible transmission events. A mortality rate of 24% was recorded over the time of admission in the burn unit. Conclusion This study revealed a high potential for MRSA outbreaks and emergence of resistant pathogens amongst burn patients due to lack of patient screening and extended empirical use of antibiotics. Our observations underscore the need to implement a system of antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention where microbiological diagnostics results are made available to physicians for timely and appropriate patient treatment.","Amissah, Na; Van Dam, L; Ablordey, A; Ampomah, Ow; Prah, I; Tetteh, Cs; Van Der Werf, Ts; Friedrich, Aw; Rossen, Jw; Van Dijl, Jm; Stienstra, Y",10.1371/journal.pone.0181072,Plos One
Can Microplastics Facilitate The Emergence Of Infectious Diseases?,"Plastic pollution is a major environmental problem. Small plastic particles (called microplastics) have been reported to have pernicious effects on human and wildlife health, by altering physiological functions (e.g., immunity, metabolism) and interfering with commensal microorganisms. However, in addition to these direct toxic effects, we suggest that microplastic pollution might also exert deleterious effects, modifying (i) the exposure to pathogens (e.g., multi-drug resistant bacteria) and (ii) the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Therefore, we argue that microplastics should be considered as a ubiquitous environmental hazard, potentially promoting the (re)emergence of infectious diseases. The implementation of multi-and interdisciplinary research projects are crucial to properly evaluate if microplastic pollution should be added to the current list of global health threats.","Loiseau, C; Sorci, G",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153694,Science Of The Total Environment
"Contamination Sources, Biofilm-Forming Ability And Biocide Resistance Of Staphylococcus Aureus In Tilapia-Processing Facilities","The major contamination sources, biofilm-forming ability and biocide resistance of Staphylococcus aureus in tilapia-processing plants were evaluated. Twenty-five processing control points were analysed twice in two factories, including whole tilapias, frozen fillets, water and food-contact surfaces. No final product was contaminated with S. aureus. However, high concentrations of S. aureus carrying enterotoxin (se) genes were found in several processing points of both factories due to the application of inadequate hygienic and handling procedures, which generate a high risk of cross-contamination of the tilapia fillets with staphylococcal enterotoxins. Nine S. aureus strains were characterized by RAPD-PCR using primers AP-7, ERIC-2 and S. A wide diversity of se gene profiles was detected, most strains being multi-se-carriers. All S. aureus strains showed high biofilm-forming ability on stainless steel and polystyrene. Biofilm-forming ability was correlated with the presence of fliC H7 and the type of origin surface (metallic or plastic). A marked resistance of S. aureus to peracetic acid and sodium hypochlorite was also observed, required doses being higher than those recommended by manufacturers to be eradicated. Case-by-case approaches are thus recommended to determine the sources and degree of contamination present in each factory, which would allow applying precise responses that avoid, or at least reduce, the presence of bacterial pathogens and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.","Vázquez-Sánchez, D; Galvao, Ja; Oetterer, M",10.1177/1082013217742753,Food Science And Technology International
Use Of Nanotechnology For Infectious Disease Diagnostics: Application In Drug Resistant Tuberculosis,"BackgroundThe increased transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) poses a challenge to tuberculosis prevention and control in Sri Lanka. Isoniazid (INH) is a key element of the first line anti tuberculosis treatment regimen. Resistance to INH may lead to development of MDR TB. Therefore, early detection of INH resistance is important to curb spread of resistance. Due to the limited availability of rapid molecular methods for detection of drug resistance in Sri Lanka, this study was aimed at developing a simple and rapid gold nanoparticle (AuNP) based lateral flow strip for the simultaneous detection of the most common INH resistance mutation (katG S315T, 78.6%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb).MethodsLateral flow strip was designed on an inert plastic backing layer containing a sample pad, nitrocellulose membrane and an absorption pad. Biotin labeled 4 capture probes which separately conjugated with streptavidin were immobilized on the nitrocellulose. The test sample was prepared by multiplex PCR using primers to amplify codon 315 region of the katG gene and MTb specific IS6110 region. The two detection probes complementary to the 5 end of each amplified fragment was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (20nm) and coupled with the above amplified PCR products were applied on the sample pad. The hybridization of the amplified target regions to the respective capture probes takes place when the sample moves towards the absorption pad. Positive hybridization is indicated by red colour lines.ResultsThe three immobilized capture probes on the strip (for the detection of TB, katG wild type and mutation) were 100 and 96.6% specific and 100 and 92.1% sensitive respectively.Conclusion The AuNP based lateral flow assay was capable of differentiating the specific mutation and the wild type along with MTb identification within 3h.","Karunaratne, Re; Wijenayaka, La; Wijesundera, Ss; De Silva, Kmn; Adikaram, Cp; Perera, J",10.1186/s12879-019-4259-x,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Prevalence And Risk Assessment Of Microplastics In The Nile Delta Estuaries: The Plastic Nile Revisited,"Recent research is directed toward studying plastic pollution in rivers, and estuaries due to the importance of freshwa-ter bodies in all aspects of life. The river deltas and estuaries are interesting for studying the flux of plastics into the oceans. The Nile River has been identified as a hot spot of plastic litter flux in the eastern Mediterranean basin. In addition, it was nicknamed Plastic Nile, yet this major river is largely unexplored with a lack of field measurements and adequate surveys. The current study was based on bridging this scientific gap. Three trips were conducted, cover-ing 30 km in the Rosetta branch and 23 km in the Damietta branch, during the high water level in summer 2021, and 10 km off the inlet of Lake Burullus, in spring 2021. Microplastics in surface water ranged from 761 +/- 319 to 1718 +/- 1008 MPs/m3, and from 167 +/- 137 to 1630 +/- 1303 MPs/kg of dry sediments. Land use/ land cover mapping using Sentinel-2 images showed several sources of pollution that contribute to plastic contamination in the study area. Ther-mal analysis indicated seven plastic polymers; including, PE, PP, PET, PEVA, and PTFE, using discarded plastic prod-ucts as reference materials. Microplastics were composed of colored and glossy fragments of sizes <500 mu m, originating from land-based sources. Pollution load, polymer risk assessment, and ecological risk indices were calculated. Based on field observations macro-plastics were retained within the extensive network of infrastructure and dam systems. 80-106 billion MPs/year were estimated to flux from the Nile estuaries into the Mediterranean Sea. The current situation urges the development of binding plans to reduce plastic waste in the Nile Delta, as well as setting environ-mental monitoring points along the Deltaic coast.","Shabaka, S; Moawad, Mn; Ibrahim, Mia; El-Sayed, Aam; Ghobashy, Mm; Hamouda, Az; El-Alfy, Ma; Darwish, Dh; Youssef, Na",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158446,Science Of The Total Environment

Plastic Probe Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Developed For Rapid Fingerprint Profile Of Biological Samples Without Pretreatment,"A triangular-shaped flat plastic substrate probe was prepared for direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for analysis of untreated chemical and biological samples including liquids (Met-Arg-Phe-Ala peptide, reserpine, and dodecyl aldehyde), solids (biological samples, traditional Chinese medicine), and powders (roasted coffee, rhizoma coptidis, lotus plumule, and Schisandra sphenanthera). Quantitative analysis of reserpine in water yielded a detection limit of 1 ng mL-1, dynamic response range within 1-500 ng mL(-1), and linearity of signal response >0.9925. Compared to the conventional capillary ESI, this plastic probe ESI offers lower cost of analysis (US $0.0056 per probe), higher sensitivity, lower sample consumption, longer signal duration (>6 min), better reproducibility, signal stability, and higher speed of analysis (<10 s per sample, including sample loading). Overall, the results indicate the potential of ESI-MS based on flat plastic probes as a versatile method for simple, sensitive, and stable analysis of untreated biological sample analysis.","Wang, Sl; Shan, S; Yang, J; Zhou, Jh; Wang, Gf",10.1007/s00216-023-04947-6,Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry
Boar Management And Semen Handling Factors Affect The Quality Of Boar Extended Semen,"Artificial insemination (AI) is the preferred method for reproduction in the majority of the intensive pig production systems Worldwide. To this end, fresh extended ready-to-use semen doses are either purchased from AI-centres or produced by boars kept on-farm. For profitable semen production, it is necessary to obtain a maximum amount of high quality semen from each boar. This paper reviews current knowledge on factors that may affect semen quality by influencing the boar or the semen during processing. Genetic markers could be used for early detection of boars with the highest fertility potential. Genetic selection for fast growth might jeopardize semen quality. Early detection of boars no longer fit for semen production might be possible by ultrasonography of the testes. Seasonal variation in sperm quality could be associated with changes in photoperiod and heat stress during summer. Comfortable housing, with appropiate bedding material to avoid locomotion problems is essential. In some areas, cooling systems may be necessary to avoid heat stress. The sperm quality can be manipulated by feeding strategies aiming, for instance, to increase sperm resistance to oxidative stress and extend storage duration. High collection frequency will negatively influence sperm quality. Also, if collection is not hygienically performed it will result in bacterial contamination of the semen doses. The concern over bacterial contamination has risen not only because of its negative effect on semen quality but also due to the detection of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from extended semen. Moreover, bacterial and viral pathogens must be monitored because they affect semen production and quality and constitute a risk of herd infection. During processing, boar sperm are submitted to many stress factors that can cause oxidative stress and capacitation-like changes potentially reducing their fertility potential. Dilution rate or dilution temperature affects the quality of the semen doses. Some packaging might preserve semen better than others and some plastic components might be toxic for sperm.

Spatio-Genetic And Phenotypic Modelling Elucidates Resistance And Re-Sensitisation To Treatment In Heterogeneous Melanoma,"Although novel targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma, understanding and combatting drug resistance remains a major clinical challenge. Using partial differential equations, we describe the evolution of a cellular population through time, space, and phenotype dimensions, in the presence of various drug species. We then use this framework to explore models in which resistance is attained by either mutations (irreversible) or plasticity (reversible). Numerical results suggest that punctuated evolutionary assumptions are more consistent with results obtained from murine melanoma models than gradual evolution. Furthermore, in the context of an evolving tumour cell population, sequencing the treatment, for instance applying immunotherapy before BRAF inhibitors, can increase treatment effectiveness. However, drug strategies which showed success within a spatially homogeneous tumour environment were unsuccessful under heterogeneous conditions, suggesting that spatio-environmental heterogeneity may be the greatest challenge to tumour therapies. Plastic metabolic models are additionally capable of reproducing the characteristic resistant tumour volume curves and predicting re-sensitisation to secondary waves of treatment observed in patient derived xenograft (PDX) melanomas treated with MEK and BRAF inhibitors. Nevertheless, secondary relapse due to a pre-adapted subpopulation, remaining after the first wave of treatment, results in a more rapid development of resistance. Our model provides a framework through which tumour resistance can be understood and would suggest that carefully phased treatments may be able to overcome the development of long-term resistance in melanoma.

"Accumulation Of Polyethylene Microplastics In River Biofilms And Effect On The Uptake, Biotransformation And Toxicity Of The Antimicrobial Triclosan","The interaction of multiple stressors in freshwater ecosystems may lead to adverse effects on aquatic communities and their ecological functions. Microplastics (MPs) are a class of contaminants of emerging concern that can exert both direct and indirect ecotoxicological effects. A growing number of studies have investigated MPsattached microbial communities, but the interaction between MPs and substrate-associated biofilm (i.e., on natural river substrates, such as stones and sediments) remains poorly studied. In this work, the combined effects of polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) with a particle size of 10-45 mu m (2 mg/L) and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) (20 mu g/L) were investigated on river biofilms through a short-term exposure experiment (72 h). To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of MPs and chemical contaminants in substrate-associated river biofilms were assessed. Different response parameters were evaluated, including (i) exposure assessment and ii) contaminants effects at different levels: bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), photosynthetic efficiency (Yeff), and leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAPA). Triclosan was accumulated in river biofilms (1189-1513 ng/g dw) alongside its biotransformation product methyl-triclosan (20-29 ng/g dw). Also, PE-MPs were detected on biofilms (168-292 MP/cm2), but they had no significant influence on the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of TCS. A moderate shift in bacterial community composition was driven by TCS, regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure (e.g., increased relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae family). Additionally, Yeff and EPS content were significantly disrupted in TCSexposed biofilms. Therefore, the most remarkable effects on river biofilms were related to the antimicrobial TCS, whereas single PE-MPs exposure did not alter any of the evaluated parameters. These results demonstrate that biofilms might act as environmental sink of MPs. Although no interaction between PE-MPs and TCS was observed, the possible indirect impact of other MPs-adsorbed contaminants on biofilms should be further assessed.","Castaño-Ortiz, Jm; Romero, F; Cojoc, L; Barceló, D; Bálcazar, Jl; Rodríguez-Mozaza, S; Santos, Lhmlm",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123369,Environmental Pollution
A Risk-Oriented Evaluation Of Biofilm And Other Influencing Factors On Biological Quality Of Drinking Water For Dairy Cows,"Several researchers have considered water an essential nutrient for dairy cows, but studies on its quality are rare. This study evaluated the biological water quality from Western German dairy farms, identified risk factors for quality impairment, showed that microbial growth on trough surfaces is related to biological water quality, and detected antibiotic-resistant bacteria in troughs. Despite the importance of livestock drinking water quality on animal physiology, welfare, and performance, influences such as biofilm formation on trough surfaces on microbial water quality are rarely researched. The objective of this study was to assess the microbial quality of water offered to lactating dairy cows and identify risk factors for poor water quality. We further aimed to determine the impact of biofilm formation on water quality and evaluate rapid test systems to score the hygiene status of dairy troughs on the farm. A total of 105 troughs located on 24 typical Western German dairy farms were sampled. Samples of livestock drinking water and biofilm were analyzed for aerobic total viable count (TVC), coliform count (CC), Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and other bacteria resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins (CRB). Surface protein- and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-rapid tests were evaluated to detect biofilm formation. The influence of 22 selected fixed and variable trough characteristics on impaired livestock drinking water quality was evaluated by calculating odds ratios. The average TVC, CC, and E. coli counts were 4.4 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SD), 1.7 +/- 0.1, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 log(10) cfu per mL, respectively. CC was detectable in 94.3% of all water samples and E. coli in 48.6%. MRSA was found in pooled livestock drinking water samples of a single farm and CRB on three farms, suggesting that troughs might function as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, thereby contributing to an exchange of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between animals. Risk factors for the impairment of at least one microbial quality criteria (TVC, CC, or E. coli) increased significantly (P < 0.05) when using high-volume troughs, other trough materials than stainless steel, a lower distance to the milking parlor, heavy visible soiling, biofilm formation, and high ambient and high water temperatures. CC (r = 0.46; P < 0.001) and E. coli (r = 0.31; P < 0.01) of water samples correlated with their equivalent in biofilm and with the results of rapid tests on trough surfaces (0.31 > r > 0.19; P < 0.05). Addressing the identified risk factors could be an approach to ensure sufficient biological quality of livestock drinking water. Lay Summary Although water is recognized as one of the most important nutrients for dairy cows, only limited research on its quality and potential risk factors for quality impairments is available. This study aimed to evaluate biological water quality on Western German dairy farms, identify potential risk factors for impairment, and evaluate rapid test systems to score the hygienic status of troughs. Water, biofilm, and trough surfaces of 105 water troughs on 24 dairy farms were sampled and analyzed. The bacterial load of sampled livestock drinking water was relatively high. Nearly half of all water samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detectable on four farms. Identified risk factors for poor biological water quality that could be used to ensure sufficient water quality on-farm were: high-volume troughs, plastic or cast iron as trough material, a lower distance to the milking parlor, heavy visible soiling, biofilm formation, and high ambient and high water temperatures. Rapid test systems to evaluate trough surfaces correlated with biofilm and water analysis results and could be a useful tool for farmers to check water quality on-farm.","Hayer, Jj; Heinemann, C; Schulze-Dieckhoff, Bg; Steinhoff-Wagner, J",10.1093/jas/skac112,Journal Of Animal Science
Plug-And-Play In Vitro Metastasis System Toward Recapitulating The Metastatic Cascade,"Microfluidic-based tumor models that mimic tumor culture environment have been developed to understand the cancer metastasis mechanism and discover effective antimetastatic drugs. These models successfully recapitulated key steps of metastatic cascades, yet still limited to few metastatic steps, operation difficulty, and small molecule absorption. In this study, we developed a metastasis system made of biocompatible and drug resistance plastics to recapitulate each metastasis stage in three-dimensional (3D) mono- and co-cultures formats, enabling the investigation of the metastatic responses of cancer cells (A549-GFP). The plug-and-play feature enhances the efficiency of the experimental setup and avoids initial culture failures. The results demonstrate that cancer cells tended to proliferate and migrate with circulating flow and intravasated across the porous membrane after a period of 3 d when they were treated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) or co-cultured with human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). The cells were also observed to detach and migrate into the circulating flow after a period of 20 d, indicating that they transformed into circulating tumor cells for the next metastasis stage. We envision this metastasis system can provide novel insights that would aid in fully understanding the entire mechanism of tumor invasion.","Ni, Bs; Tzao, C; Huang, Jh",10.1038/s41598-019-54711-z,Scientific Reports
Impact Of Pvc Microplastics In Photodynamic Inactivation Of Staphylococcus Aureus And Mrsa,"Photodynamic processes have found widespread application in therapies. These processes involve photosensitizers (PSs) that, when excited by specific light wavelengths and in the presence of molecular oxygen, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), that target cells leading to inactivation. Photodynamic action has gained notable attention in environmental applications, particularly against pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) that pose a significant challenge to public health. However, environmental matrices frequently encompass additional contaminants and interferents, including microplastics (MPs), which are pollutants of current concern. Their presence in water and effluents has been extensively documented, highlighting their impact on conventional treatment methods, but this information remains scarce in the context of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) setups. Here, we described the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microparticles in PDI targeting Staphylococcus aureus and its methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA), using curcumin as a PS under blue light. The presence of PVC microparticles does not hinder ROS formation; however, depending on its concentration, it can impact bacterial inactivation. Our results underscore that PDI remains a potent method for reducing bacterial concentrations in water and wastewater containing ARB, even in highly contaminated scenarios with MPs.","Lima, Ar; Silva, Kjs; Aguiar, Asn; De Souza, M; Lima, Thn; Blanco, Kc; Bagnato, Vs; Dias, Ld",10.2166/wst.2024.104,Water Science And Technology
Microplastics As Vectors Of Chemical Contaminants And Biological Agents In Freshwater Ecosystems: Current Knowledge Status And Future Perspectives*,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous, and their environmental fate is becoming an issue of concern. Our review aims to synthesize current knowledge status and provide future perspectives regarding the vector effect of MPs for chemical contaminants and biological agents. The evidence in the literature indicates that MPs are a vector for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and pharmaceuticals. Concentrations of chemical contaminant in orders of six-fold higher on MPs surfaces than in the surrounding environmental waters have been reported. Chemical pollutants such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PAFSs), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), exhibiting polarities in the range of 3.3-9 are the commonest chemicals reported on MP surfaces. Regarding metals on MPs including chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), the presence of C-O and N-H in MPs promote a relatively high adsorption of these metals onto MP surfaces. Regarding pharmaceuticals, not much has been done, but a few studies indicate that commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen have been associated with MPs. There is sufficient evidence supporting the claim that MPs can act as vectors for viruses, bacterial and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, and MPs act to accelerate horizontal and vertical gene transfer. An area that deserves urgent attention is whether MPs can act as vectors for invertebrates and vertebrates, mainly non-native, invasive freshwater species. Despite the ecological significance of invasive biology, little research has been done in this regard. Overall, our review summarises the state of the current knowledge, identifies critical research gaps and provides perspectives for future research.","Tumwesigye, E; Nnadozie, Cf; Akamagwuna, Fc; Noundou, Xs; Nyakairu, Gw; Odume, On",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121829,Environmental Pollution
Overview Of Host Defense Peptides And Their Applications For Plastic And Reconstructive Surgeons,"Background: Host defense peptides are a family of endogenous short peptides that are found in all living beings and play a critical role in innate immunity against infection. Methods: A nonsystematic review of host defense peptides was conducted with specific interest in properties and applications relevant to plastic and reconstructive surgery. Results: In addition to their direct antimicrobial actions against pathogens, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, they also demonstrate important functions in immunomodulation, tumor cell lysis, and tissue regeneration. These properties have made them a topic of clinical interest for plastic surgeons because of their potential applications as novel antibiotics, wound healing medications, and cancer therapies. The rising clinical interest has led to a robust body of literature describing host defense peptides in great depth and breadth. Numerous mechanisms have been observed to explain their diverse functions, which rely on specific structural characteristics. However, these peptides remain mostly experimental, with limited translation to clinical practice because of numerous failures to achieve acceptable results in human trials. Conclusions: Despite the broad ranging potential of these peptides for use in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, they are rarely discussed in the literature or at scientific meetings. In this review, the authors provide a summary of the background, structure, function, bacterial resistance, and clinical applications of host defense peptides with the goal of stimulating host defense peptide-based innovation within the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery.","Delong, Mr; Tandon, Vj; Da Lio, Al; Deming, Tj; Cederna, Ps",10.1097/PRS.0000000000006910,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Effective Elimination Of Contaminant Antibiotics Using High-Surface-Area Magnetic-Functionalized Graphene Nanocomposites Developed From Plastic Waste,"The presence of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments represents a risk for the equilibrium of the ecosystem and may seriously affect human safety itself in the long term. To address this issue, we have synthesized functional materials based on highly-reduced graphene oxide (HRGO), sulfonated graphene (SG), and magnetic sulfonated graphene (MSG). The method of synthesis adopted is simple and inexpensive and makes use of plastic bottle waste as the raw material. We have tested the fabricated materials for their adsorption efficiency against two model antibiotics in aqueous solutions, namely Garamycin and Ampicillin. Our tests involved the optimization of different experimental parameters of the adsorption process, such as starting antibiotic concentration, amount of adsorbent, and time. Finally, we characterized the effect of the antibiotic adsorption process on common living organisms, namely Escherichia coli DH5 alpha (E. coli DH5 alpha) bacteria. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the method in addressing the issue of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which will help in preventing changes in the ecosystem.","Elessawy, Na; Gouda, Mh; Ali, Sm; Salerno, M; Eldin, Msm",10.3390/ma13071517,Materials

Universal Contact Precautions Do Not Change The Prevalence Of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms In A Tertiary Burn Unit,"Objective: The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (ARO) in burn units is increasing worldwide and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Study aims are to describe the burden of AROs in burn patients admitted to a tertiary burn unit, to evaluate the impact of contact precautions implemented after an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and to identify possible predictors of ARO acquisition. Methods: Data of burn inpatients between 2006 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of ARO colonization/infection at or after admission were reviewed in detail. Organisms of interest included: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed with the p-value set at 0.05. Results: Complete data analysis was available for 340 patients. The mean age was 41.8 years with male predominance. Among the AROs, the most prevalent was MRSA from clinical specimens. Prior to contact precaution implementation, the prevalence of all AROs was 27.9%, compared to 27.6% afterwards. There was an increase in Pseudomonas and VRE isolates and a disappearance of Acinetobacter. The most common isolate sites were the burn wounds. ICU stay, burns >20% TBSA, and surgical management were significant predictors of ARO acquisition. Conclusion: This study describes the ARO profile of burn patients admitted to a tertiary burn unit. The results suggest that implementation of unit-wide contact precautions may not significantly reduce the frequency of AROs among burn patients. Contact precautions for patients transferred from the ICU, undergoing surgery, and large burns may be of benefit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

Surface-Attached Sulfonamide Containing Quaternary Ammonium Antimicrobials For Textiles And Plastics,"With the risks associated with healthcare-associated infections and the rise of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, there is an important need to control the proliferation of these factors in hospitals, retirement homes and other institutions. This work explores the development and application of a novel class of sulfonamide-based quaternary ammonium antimicrobial coatings, anchored to commercially and clinically relevant material surfaces. Synthesized in high yields (60-97%), benzophenone-anchored antimicrobials were spray-coated and UV grafted onto plastic surfaces, while silane-anchored variants were adhered to select textiles via dip-coating. Surface modified samples were characterised by advancing contact angle, anionic dye staining, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. After verifying coating quality through the above characterization methods, microbiological testing was performed on batch samples in conditions that simulate the natural inoculation of surfaces and objects (solid/air) and water containers (solid/liquid). Using the previously established Large Drop Inoculum (LDI) protocol at solid/air interfaces, all treated samples showed a full reduction (10(5)-10(7) CFU) of viable Arthrobacter sp., S. aureus, and E. coli after 3 h of contact time. Additional testing of the walls of plastic LDPE vials treated with a UV-cured sulfonamide antimicrobial at a solid/liquid interface using the newly developed Large Reservoir Inoculum (LRI) protocol under static conditions revealed a complete kill (>10(6) reduction) of Gram-positive Arthrobacter sp., and a partial kill (>10(4) reduction) of Gram-negative E. coli within 24-48 h of contact.","Caschera, A; Mistry, Kb; Bedard, J; Ronan, E; Syed, Ma; Khan, Au; Lough, Aj; Wolfaardt, G; Foucher, Da",10.1039/c8ra10173f,Rsc Advances
The Travelling Particles: Investigating Microplastics As Possible Transport Vectors For Multidrug Resistant E. Coli In The Weser Estuary (Germany),"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in aquatic environments has been a long withstanding health concern, namely extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. Given increasing reports on microplastic (MP) pollution in these environments, it has become crucial to better understand the role of MP particles as transport vectors for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed where particles of both synthetic and natural material (HDPE, tyre wear, and wood) were sequentially incubated at multiple sites along a salinity gradient from the Lower Weser estuary (Germany) to the offshore island Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). Following each incubation period, particle biofilms and water samples were assessed for ESBL-producing E. coli, first by the enrichment and detection of E. coli using Fluorocult (R) LMX Broth followed by cultivation on CHROMAgar (TM) ESBL media to select for ESBL-producers. Results showed that general E. coli populations were present on the surfaces of wood particles across all sites but none were found to produce ESBLs. Additionally, neither HDPE nor tyre wear particles were found to harbour any E. coli. Conversely, ESBL-producing E. coli were present in surrounding waters from all sites, 64% of which conferred resistances against up to 3 other antibiotic groups, additional to the beta-lactam resistances intrinsic to ESBL-producers. This study provides a first look into the potential of MP to harbour and transport multidrug-resistant E. coli across different environments and the approach serves as an important precursor to further studies on other potentially harmful MP-colonizing species.

Making Medical Devices Safer: Impact Of Plastic And Silicone Oil On Microbial Biofilm Formation,"Background: Medical devices face the challenge of microbial biofilm attached to the surface. Ultimately, this may jeopardize the function of the device and increase the patient's risk of infection. However, reliable methods to prevent biofilm are lacking. Aim: To investigate the effect of silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic, used in a new automatic urinometer, on biofilm formation; furthermore, to explore the impact of silicone oil viscosity and compare polypropylene with polystyrene, another common medical plastic. Methods: Common pathogens, including extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing and multi-drug-resistant bacteria, as well as Candida albicans, were investigated. Isogenic Escherichia coli strains deficient in the important biofilm forming factors curli, cellulose and type 1 fimbriae (fim D) were used to determine the possible mode of action by silicone oil. Clear flat-bottomed polypropylene or polystyrene wells were pretreated with either low- or medium-viscosity silicone oil and microbes were added. After 72 h, biofilm formation was quantified using crystal violet assay. Findings: Silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic surfaces, regardless of the oil viscosity, significantly inhibited biofilm formation of all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including ESBL-producing and multi-drug resistant strains, as well as C. albicans. Silicone oil did not affect bacterial or candida growth and curli fimbriae were found to be the main target of silicone oil. Polypropylene plastic itself without oil had a better effect in preventing biofilm formation than polystyrene. Conclusion: These findings suggest a new strategy to decrease microbial biofilm formation, which may reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent dysfunction of medical devices.

Rapid Real-Time Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing With Electrical Sensing On Plastic Microchips With Printed Electrodes,"Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing is important for efficient and timely therapeutic decision making. Due to globally spread bacterial resistance, the efficacy of antibiotics is increasingly being impeded. Conventional antibiotic tests rely on bacterial culture, which is time-consuming and can lead to potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescription and up-front broad range of antibiotic use. There is an urgent need to develop point-of-care platform technologies to rapidly detect pathogens, identify the right antibiotics, and monitor mutations to help adjust therapy. Here, we report a biosensor for rapid (<90 min), real time, and label-free bacteria isolation from whole blood and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Target bacteria are captured on flexible plastic-based microchips with printed electrodes using antibodies (30 min), and its electrical response is monitored in the presence and absence of antibiotics over an hour of incubation time. We evaluated the microchip with Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as clinical models with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, daptomycin, gentamicin, and methicillin antibiotics. The results are compared with the current standard methods, i.e. bacteria-viability and conventional antibiogram assays. The technology presented here has the potential to provide precise and rapid bacteria screening and guidance in clinical therapies by identifying the correct antibiotics for pathogens.","Safavieh, M; Pandya, Hj; Venkataraman, M; Thirumalaraju, P; Kanakasabapathy, Mk; Singh, A; Prabhakar, D; Chug, Mk; Shafiee, H",10.1021/acsami.6b16571,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Tuning Antibacterial Efficacy Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa By Using Green Agnps In Chitosan Thin Films As A Plastic Alternative,"Nanotechnology advancements have facilitated the development of eco-friendly strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This study promotes a green method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing Eucalyptus globulus leaf extracts as an alternative to traditional colloidal AgNPs obtained through chemical synthesis, investigating their antibacterial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their impact on the expression of bacterial virulence factors (pyocyanin, pyoverdine, rhamnolipids). This work demonstrates that: i. while colloidal AgNPs showed ineffective up to 120 mu M, green AgNPs had a bactericidal effect already at 20 mu M, without impacting bacterial virulence factors at sub-inhibitory concentrations; ii. the polyphenolic shell surrounding green AgNPs could play a crucial role in the antibacterial mechanisms, with a pro-oxidant action confirmed by a greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); iii. AgNPs improved the antibacterial properties of chitosan when incorporated into thin films. Consequently, an environmentally friendly nanocomposite film with antibacterial and antibiofilm properties was produced, which holds promise for application in food packaging to mitigate the emergence of microbial contamination in food products.","Villani, S; De Matteis, V; Calcagnile, M; Cascione, M; Pellegrino, P; Vincenti, L; Demitri, C; Alifano, P; Rinaldi, R",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.138277,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules

Coatable And Resistance-Proof Ionic Liquid For Pathogen Eradication,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria infect close to 3 million people, and kill 35,000, each year in the United States. Ionic liquid (IL)-based antimicrobial agents have the potential to diversify our ever-diminishing antibiotic arsenal.

Candida Auris Susceptibility On Surfaces Coated With The Antifungal Drug Caspofungin,"Candida auris is known to survive for weeks on solid material surfaces.

We fabricated antifungal surface coatings by coating plastic and glass surfaces with a thin polymer layer to which the antifungal drug caspofungin was covalently conjugated. Caspofungin-susceptible and -resistant C. auris strains were inhibited on these surfaces by 98.7 and 81.1%, respectively. Cell viability studies showed that this inhibition was fungicidal. Our findings indicate that C. auris strains can be killed on contact when exposed to caspofungin that is reformulated as a covalently-bound surface layer.

Polyethylene Glycol Coatings On Plastic Substrates For Chemically Defined Stem Cell Culture,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a widely available and clinically relevant cell type with a host of applications in regenerative medicine. Current clinical expansion methods can lead to selective changes in hMSC phenotype potentially resulting from relatively undefined cell culture surfaces. Chemically defined synthetic surfaces can aid in understanding the influence of cell-material interactions on stem cell behavior. Here, a thin copolymer coating for hMSC culture on plastic substrates is developed. The random copolymer is synthesized by living free radical polymerization and characterized in solution before application to the substrate, ensuring a homogeneous coating and limiting the sample-to-sample variations. The ability to coat multiple substrate types and cover large surface areas is reported. Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides are incorporated into the coating under aqueous conditions via their lysine or cysteine side chains, resulting in amide and thioester linkages, respectively. Stability studies show amide linkages to be stable and thioester linkages to be labile under standard serum-containing culture conditions. In addition, chemically defined passaging of hMSCs using only ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on polystyrene dishes is shown. After passage, the hMSCs can be seeded back onto the same plate, indicating potential reusability of the coating.","Schmitt, Sk; Xie, Aw; Ghassemi, Rm; Trebatoski, Dj; Murphy, Wl; Gopalan, P",10.1002/adhm.201500191,Advanced Healthcare Materials
Effect Of Incubation Temperature On Antibiotic Resistance And Virulence Factors Of Acinetobacter Baumannii Atcc 17978,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a notorious opportunistic pathogen that is prevalent mainly in hospital settings. The ability of A. baumannii to adapt and to survive in a range of environments has been a key factor for its persistence and success as an opportunistic pathogen. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature on the clinically relevant phenotypes displayed by A. baumannii at 37 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Surface-associated motility was significantly reduced at 28 degrees C, while biofilm formation on plastic surfaces was increased at 28 degrees C. Decreased susceptibility to aztreonam and increased susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were observed at 28 degrees C. No differences in virulence, as assayed in a Galleria mellonella model, were observed. Proteomic analysis showed differential expression of 629 proteins, of which 366 were upregulated and 263 were downregulated at 28 degrees C.

The Dangerous Transporters: A Study Of Microplastic-Associated Bacteria Passing Through Municipal Wastewater Treatment,"Microplastics (MPs) provide a stable and protective habitat for diverse wastewater bacteria, including pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant species. Therefore, MPs may potentially transport these bacteria through wastewater treatment steps to the environment and far distances. This study investigated bacterial communities of MP - associated bacteria from different stages of municipal wastewater treatment processes to evaluate the poten- tial negative effect of these biofilms on the environment. The results showed a high diversity of bacteria that were strongly attached to MPs. After all treatment steps, the core bacterial groups remained attached to MPs and escaped from the wastewater treatment plant with effluent water. Several pathogenic bacteria were identified in MP samples from all treatment steps, and most of them were found in effluent water. These data provide new insights into the possible impacts of wastewater-derived MPs on the environment. MP-associated biofilms were proved to be important sources of pathogens and antibiotic-resistant genes in natural waters.","Kruglova, A; Munoz-Palazon, B; Gonzalez-Martinez, A; Mikola, A; Vahala, R; Talvitie, J",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120316,Environmental Pollution
Simultaneous Dissemination Of Nanoplastics And Antibiotic Resistance By Nematode Couriers,"Thisstudy reports the dissemination of antibiotic-resistantbacteria and associated antibiotic-adsorbed nanoplastics across thesoil by bacterivorous nematodes. Nanoplastics (NPs) are increasingly recognized as a newlyemergingpollutant in the environment. NPs can enable the colonization of microbialpathogens on their surfaces and adsorb toxic pollutants, such as heavymetals and residual antibiotics. Although the dissemination of plasticparticles in water bodies and the atmosphere is widely studied, thedissemination of NPs and adsorbed pollutants on land, via biologicalmeans, is poorly understood. Since soil animals, such as the bacterivorousnematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), are highly mobile, this raises the possibilitythat they play an active role in disseminating NPs and adsorbed pollutants.Here, we established that antibiotic-resistant bacteria could aggregatewith antibiotic-adsorbed NPs to form antibiotic-adsorbed NP-antibioticresistant bacteria (ANP-ARB) aggregates, using polymyxins (colistin)as a proof-of-concept. Colistin-resistant mcr-1 bearing Escherichia coli from a mixed population of resistantand sensitive bacteria selectively aggregate with colistin-ANPs. Inthe soil microcosm, C. elegans fedon ANP-ARB clusters, resulting in the rapid spread of ANP-ARB by thenematodes across the soil at a rate of 40-60 cm per day. Ourwork revealed insights into how NPs could still disseminate acrossthe soil faster than previously thought by hitching a ridein soil animals and acting as agents of antibiotic-resistant pathogensand antibiotic contaminants. This poses direct risks to ecology, agriculturalsustainability, and human health.","Chan, Sy; Liu, Sy; Wu, Rb; Wei, W; Fang, Jkh; Chua, Sl",10.1021/acs.est.2c07129,Environmental Science & Technology
"Old And New Contaminants And Their Management: Learning From The Past, Looking To The Future","Within the 50 year lifetime of the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (SEGH), we have seen a number of contaminants transfer from being the wonder chemical of their day through to becoming current contaminants of concern. This is also true for a variety of emerging contaminants such as plastic microbeads, pharmaceutical residues, and fire retardant chemicals, amongst others. This thought piece discusses the risk associated with a range of these emerging contaminants, their global nature, how existing models and frameworks can be applied to deal with their impacts, and research and management gaps and challenges.

Acinetobacter Baumannii Can Be Transferred From Contaminated Nitrile Examination Gloves To Polypropylene Plastic Surfaces,"Background: Several observational studies suggest that gloves of health care workers are major routes of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii transmission. However, limited experimental data are available assessing Acinetobacter transmission from gloves to environmental surfaces. This study determined whether A baumannii was easily transferred from nitrile gloves to polypropylene plastic compared with other gram-negative bacteria that cause health care-associated infections in laboratory-controlled experiments. Methods: Gloved fingerpad-to-fomite transfer efficiency was determined for drug-resistant and -sensitive strains of A baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results: Only A baumannii transferred from gloves to fomites 3 minutes after the bacterial transfer event. Transfer efficiency of A baumannii was 0.1%-33% at that time point. Discussion: Bacterial transfer from contaminated gloves to the hospital environment may be related to the type of contaminating bacteria, inoculated bacterial level, fomites, and glove materials. Therefore, it is important to need a comprehensive assessment of the transfer efficiency. Conclusions: A baumannii can transfer easily from nitrile gloves to fomite compared with other gram-negative bacteria that cause health care-associated infections. These findings support data from previous observational studies that gloves of health care workers can be major routes of A baumannii transmission in clinical settings.

Farnesol Emulsion As An Effective Broad-Spectrum Agent Against Eskape Biofilms,"The family of ESKAPE pathogens is comprised of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter. Together they are the main contributors of nosocomial infections and are well established for their ability to escape antibiotics. Farnesol is an FDA-approved cosmetic and flavoring agent with significant anti-biofilm properties. In a proprietary emulsion, farnesol has been shown to be capable of disrupting S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii biofilms. The current work demonstrates that this farnesol emulsion reduces the number of viable bacteria, while also leading to reductions in biomass, of the other three ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter, both in vitro and in an ex vivo human skin model. A concentration of 0.5 mg/mL was effective for impeding biofilm development of all three bacteria, while 1 mg/mL for E. faecium and K. pneumoniae, or 0.2 mg/mL for E. cloacae, was able to kill bacteria in established biofilms. Contrary to antibiotics, no resistance to farnesol was observed for E. faecium or K. pneumoniae. The results indicate that farnesol is effective for direct cell killing and also has the ability to induce biofilm detachment from surfaces, as confirmed using Live/Dead image analysis. Our findings confirm that farnesol emulsion is an effective broad-spectrum agent to impede ESKAPE biofilms.","Tan, L; Ma, R; Katz, Aj; Levi, N",10.3390/antibiotics13080778,Antibiotics-Basel
Access To Thermally Robust And Abrasion Resistant Antimicrobial Plastics: Synthesis Of Uv-Curable Phosphonium Small Molecule Coatings And Extrudable Additives,"The threat of antibiotic-resistant, biofilm-forming bacteria necessitates a preventative approach to combat the proliferation of robust, pathogenic strains on high touch surfaces in the food packaging, biomedical, and healthcare industries. The development of both biocide-releasing and tethered, immobilized biocide surface coatings has risen to meet this demand. While these surface coatings have demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy, there are few examples of antimicrobial surfaces with long-term durability and performance. To this end, UV-curable phosphoniums bearing benzophenone anchors with either an alkyl, aryl, or fluoroalkyl group were synthesized and their efficacy as thermally stable antimicrobial additives in extruded plastics or as surface attached coatings probed. The surface topology and characteristics of these materials were studied to gain insight into the mechanism of their antimicrobial activity. Efficacy against both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria as either a coating or additive showed compete reductions of the initial bacterial load. Crucially, the materials maintained the ability to kill biofilm-forming bacteria even after being subject to several cycles of abrasion.","Bedard, J; Caschera, A; Foucher, Da",10.1039/d1ra00555c,Rsc Advances
Alterations In The Glycome After Hdac Inhibition Impact Oncogenic Potential In Epigenetically Plastic Sw13 Cells,"BackgroundDefects in the type and degree of cellular glycosylation impact oncogenesis on multiple levels. Although the type of glycosylation is determined by protein sequence encoded by the genome, the extent and modifications of glycosylation depends on the activity of biosynthetic enzymes and recent data suggests that the glycome is also subject to epigenetic regulation. This study focuses on the ability of HDAC inhibition to alter glycosylation and to lead to pro-oncogenic alterations in the glycome as assessed by metastatic potential and chemoresistance.MethodsEpigenetically plastic SW13 adrenocortical carcinoma cells were treated with FK228, an HDAC inhibitor with high affinity for HDAC1 and, to a lesser extent, HDAC2. In comparing HDAC inhibitor treated and control cells, differential expression of glycome-related genes were assessed by microarray. Differential glycosylation was then assessed by lectin binding arrays and the ability of cellular proteins to bind to glycans was assessed by glycan binding arrays. Differential sensitivity to paclitaxel, proliferation, and MMP activity were also assessed.ResultsTreatment with FK228 alters expression of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways for a large number of glycome related genes including enzymes in all major glycosylation pathways and several glycan binding proteins. 84% of these differentially expressed glycome-related genes are linked to cancer, some as prognostic markers and others contributing basic oncogenic functions such as metastasis or chemoresistance. Glycan binding proteins also appear to be differentially expressed as protein extracts from treated and untreated cells show differential binding to glycan arrays. The impact of differential mRNA expression of glycosylation enzymes was documented by differential lectin binding. However, the assessment of changes in the glycome is complicated by the fact that detection of differential glycosylation through lectin binding is dependent on the methods used to prepare samples as protein-rich lysates show different binding than fixed cells in several cases. Paralleling the alterations in the glycome, treatment of SW13 cells with FK228 increases metastatic potential and reduces sensitivity to paclitaxel.ConclusionsThe glycome is substantially altered by HDAC inhibition and these changes may have far-reaching impacts on oncogenesis.","Montgomery, Mr; Hull, Ee",10.1186/s12885-018-5129-4,Bmc Cancer
Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element In Evolution And Pathogenicity Of The Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Strain Usa300,"USA300 is a predominant community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain which carries an arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME). ACME contains potential virulence factors including an arginine deiminase (arc) pathway and an oligopeptide permease (opp-3) system, which are proposed to play a role in bacterial virulence and transmission. However, the role of ACME in evolution and pathogenicity of USA300 remains to be elucidated. ACME and arcA deletion mutants were created by allelic replacement from a USA300 clinical isolate. By comparing wild type and isogenic ACME deletion USA300 strains, ACME was shown not to contribute to bacterial survival on plastic surfaces, and mouse skin surfaces. ACME did not contribute to bacterial virulence in cell invasion and cytotoxicity assays, invertebrate killing assays and a mouse skin infection model. Wild-type ACME negative USA300 clinical isolates showed similar associations with invasive anatomic sites as ACME positive isolates. Our experiments also demonstrated that ACME can spontaneously excise from the bacterial chromosome to generate an ACME deletion strain at a low frequency. Our results do not support that the ACME element alone is a significant factor in the transmission and virulence of USA300 strain, and ACME may have been coincidently incorporated into the genome of USA300.","Wu, Ky; Conly, J; Mcclure, Ja; Kurwa, Ha; Zhang, Ky",10.3390/microorganisms8020275,Microorganisms
"Detection, Survival, And Persistence Of Staphylococcus Capitis Nrcs-A In Neonatal Units In England","Background: The multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus capitis clone, NRCS-A, is increasingly associated with late-onset sepsis in low birthweight newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in England and globally. Understanding where this bacterium survives and persists within the NICU environment is key to developing and implementing effective control measures. Aim: To investigate the potential for S. capitis to colonize surfaces within NICUs. Methods: Surface swabs were collected from four NICUs with and without known NRCS-A colonizations/infections present at the time of sampling. Samples were cultured and S. capitis isolates analysed via whole-genome sequencing. Survival of NRCS-A on plastic surfaces was assessed over time and compared to that of non-NRCS-A isolates. The bactericidal activity of commonly used chemical disinfectants against S. capitis was assessed. Findings: Of 173 surfaces sampled, 40 (21.1%) harboured S. capitis with 30 isolates (75%) being NRCS-A. Whereas S. capitis was recovered from surfaces across the NICU, the NRCS-A clone was rarely recovered from outside the immediate neonatal bedspace. Incubators and other bedside equipment were contaminated with NRCS-A regardless of clinical case detection. In the absence of cleaning, S. capitis was able to survive for three days with minimal losses in viability (<0.5 log(10) reduction). Sodium troclosene and a QAC-based detergent/disinfectant reduced S. capitis to below detectable levels. Conclusion: S. capitis NRCS-A can be readily recovered from the NICU environment, even in units with no recent reported clinical cases of S. capitis infection, highlighting a need for appropriate national guidance on cleaning within the neonatal care environment.

Size-Dependent Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Gut Metagenome And Antibiotic Resistance In C57Bl/6 Mice,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat for marine and terrestrial ecosystems, which has raised global concerns about its implications for human health. Mounting evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a key role in human health and diseases. The gut bacteria could be disturbed by many environmental factors, including the microplastic particles. However, the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on mycobiome, as well as gut functional metagenome has not been well studied. In this study, we performed ITS sequencing to explore the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on the fungal composition, in combination with the shotgun meta-genomics sequencing to reveal the size effects of polystyrene on the functional metagenome. We found that polystyrene microplastic particles with 0.05-0.1 mu m diameter showed greater impact on the bacterial and fungal composition of gut microbiota as well as the metabolic pathways than the polystyrene microplastic particles with 9-10 mu m diameter. Our results suggested that size-depended effects should not be ignored in the health risk assessment of microplastics.","Gao, B; Shi, Xc; Li, Ss; Xu, Wc; Gao, N; Shan, Jj; Shen, Ws",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114737,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Effect Of Bacteriophages Against Biofilms Of Escherichia Coli On Food Processing Surfaces,"The bacterial adhesion to food processing surfaces is a threat to human health, as these surfaces can serve as reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria. Escherichia coli is an easily biofilm-forming bacterium involved in surface contamination that can lead to the cross-contamination of food. Despite the application of disinfection protocols, contamination through food processing surfaces continues to occur. Hence, new, effective, and sustainable alternative approaches are needed. Bacteriophages (or simply phages), viruses that only infect bacteria, have proven to be effective in reducing biofilms. Here, phage phT4A was applied to prevent and reduce E. coli biofilm on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at 25 degrees C. The biofilm formation capacity of phage-resistant and sensitive bacteria, after treatment, was also evaluated. The inactivation effectiveness of phage phT4A was surface-dependent, showing higher inactivation on plastic surfaces. Maximum reductions in E. coli biofilm of 5.5 and 4.0 log colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(2) after 6 h of incubation on plastic and stainless steel, respectively, were observed. In the prevention assays, phage prevented biofilm formation in 3.2 log CFU/cm(2) after 12 h. Although the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria has been observed during phage treatment, phage-resistant bacteria had a lower biofilm formation capacity compared to phage-sensitive bacteria. Overall, the results suggest that phages may have applicability as surface disinfectants against pathogenic bacteria, but further studies are needed to validate these findings using phT4A under different environmental conditions and on different materials.","Bras, A; Braz, M; Martinho, I; Duarte, J; Pereira, C; Almeida, A",10.3390/microorganisms12020366,Microorganisms
Antimicrobial Face Shield: Next Generation Of Facial Protective Equipment Against Sars-Cov-2 And Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Transparent materials used for facial protection equipment provide protection against microbial infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. However, transparent materials used for this type of application are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. They just avoid direct contact between the person and the biological agent. Therefore, healthy people can become infected through contact of the contaminated material surfaces and this equipment constitute an increasing source of infectious biological waste. Furthermore, infected people can transmit microbial infections easily because the protective equipment do not inactivate the microbial load generated while breathing, sneezing or coughing. In this regard, the goal of this work consisted of fabricating a transparent face shield with intrinsic antimicrobial activity that could provide extra-protection against infectious agents and reduce the generation of infectious waste. Thus, a single-use transparent antimicrobial face shield composed of polyethylene terephthalate and an antimicrobial coating of benzalkonium chloride has been developed for the next generation of facial protective equipment. The antimicrobial coating was analyzed by atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy with elemental analysis. This is the first facial transparent protective material capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one minute of contact, and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial infections contribute to severe pneumonia associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing. Our extra protective broad-spectrum antimicrobial composite material could also be applied for the fabrication of other facial protective tools such as such as goggles, helmets, plastic masks and space separation screens used for counters or vehicles. This low-cost technology would be very useful to combat the current pandemic and protect health care workers from multidrug-resistant infections in developed and underdeveloped countries.","Tuñón-Molina, A; Martí, M; Muramoto, Y; Noda, T; Takayama, K; Serrano-Aroca, A",10.3390/ijms22179518,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Increased Capsule Thickness And Hypermotility Are Traits Of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii St3 Strains Causing Fulminant Infection,"Background. Acinetobacter baumannii is a successful nosocomial pathogen, causing severe, life-threatening infections in hospitalized patients, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections. The spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) strains is a major health threat worldwide. The successful spread of CRAB is mostly due to its highly plastic genome. Although some virulence factors associated with CRAB have been uncovered, many mechanisms contributing to its success are not fully understood. Methods. Here we describe strains of CRAB that were isolated from fulminant cases in 2 hospitals in Israel. These isolates show a rare hypermucoid (HM) phenotype and were investigated using phenotypic assays, comparative genomics, and an in vivo Galleria mellonella model. Results. The 3 isolates belonged to the ST3 international clonal type and were closely related to each other, as shown by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and phylogenetic analyses. These isolates possessed thickened capsules and a dense filamentous extracellular polysaccharides matrix as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and overexpressed the capsule polysaccharide synthesis pathway-related wzc gene. Conclusions. The HM isolates possessed a unique combination of virulence genes involved in iron metabolism, protein secretion, adherence, and membrane glycosylation. HM strains were more virulent than control strains in 2 G. mellonella infection models. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated several virulence factors, all present in 3 CRAB isolates with rare hypermucoid phenotypes.","Rakovitsky, N; Lellouche, J; Ben David, D; Frenk, S; Elmalih, P; Weber, G; Kon, H; Schwartz, D; Wolfhart, L; Temkin, E; Carmeli, Y",10.1093/ofid/ofab386,Open Forum Infectious Diseases
Comparison Of Methods For Quantitating Salmonella Enterica Typhimurium And Heidelberg Strain Attachment To Reusable Plastic Shipping Container Coupons And Preliminary Assessment Of Sanitizer Efficacy,"Salmonella serovars, one of the leading contributors to foodborne illness and are especially problematic for foods that are not cooked before consumption, such as fresh produce. The shipping containers that are used to transport and store fresh produce may play a role in cross contamination and subsequent illnesses. However, methods for quantitatively attached cells are somewhat variable. The overall goal of this study was to compare conventional plating with molecular methods for quantitating attached representative strains for Salmonella Typhimurium and Heidelberg on reusable plastic containers (RPC) coupons, respectively. We attached Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and serovar Heidelberg SL486 (parent and an antibiotic resistant marker strain) to plastic coupons (2.54cm(2)) derived from previously used shipping containers by growing for 72h in tryptic soy broth. The impact of the concentration of sanitizer on log reductions between unsanitized and sanitized coupons was evaluated by exposing attached S. Typhimurium cells to 200ppm and 200,000ppm sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Differences in sanitizer effectiveness between serovars were also evaluated with attached S. Typhimurium compared to attached S. Heidelberg populations after being exposed to 200ppm peracetic acid (PAA). Treatment with NaClO caused an average of 2.73 +/- 0.23 log CFU of S. Typhimurium per coupon removed with treatment at 200ppm while 3.36 +/- 0.54 log CFU were removed at 200,000ppm. Treatment with PAA caused an average of 2.62 +/- 0.15 log CFU removed for S. Typhimurium and 1.41 +/- 0.17 log CFU for S. Heidelberg (parent) and 1.61 +/- 0.08 log CFU (marker). Lastly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize cell attachment and coupon surface topography. SEM images showed that remaining attached cell populations were visible even after sanitizer application. Conventional plating and qPCR yielded similar levels of enumerated bacterial populations indicating a high concordance between the two methods. Therefore, qPCR could be used for the rapid quantification of Salmonella attached on RPC.","Shi, Zh; Baker, Ca; Lee, Si; Park, Sh; Kim, Sa; Ricke, Sc",10.1080/03601234.2016.1181905,Journal Of Environmental Science And Health Part B-Pesticides Food Contaminants And Agricultural Wastes
The Impact Of The Syrian Civil War On One Department In An Israeli Hospital,"During the Syrian civil war, Syrian refugees crossed the Israeli border to receive medical treatment. During this time, Galilee Medical Center (GMC) became the main center for multidisciplinary treatment of these war-wounded patients. This retrospective study compares the demographics of local Israeli and refugee Syrian patients, as well as the volume and types of procedures each group received over a 5-year period. From January 2013 to December 2017, 963 unique patients underwent 1,751 procedures in the GMC Plastic Surgery Department. Of these patients, 176 were Syrian-including 42 children-and 787 were Israeli. These groups underwent 393 and 1,358 procedures, respectively, for a procedure-per-patient ratio of 2.23 versus 1.72, respectively. On average, Syrian patients tended to be younger than Israeli patients (23.6 vs. 49.25 years), had longer median hospitalization time (50 vs. 8 days), longer median operative times (102 vs. 85 minutes), and higher incidence of infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria (52.2 vs. 5.8%). Further, Syrian patients had more trauma-related procedures, such as skin grafts, wound debridement, and microsurgery, than Israeli patients. Through this process, GMC's plastic surgery department gained unprecedented exposure to a variety of complex procedures.","Sagi, Oi; Ohana, N; Appel, R; Kogan, L",10.1055/s-0042-1749105,Seminars In Plastic Surgery
Genomic Scan Of A Healthcare-Associated Ndm-1-Producing Citrobacter Freundii St18 Isolated From A Green Sea Turtle Impacted By Plastic Pollution,"Background: Carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter freundii has been reported as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Particularly, C. freundii belonging to the sequence type (ST) 18 is considered to be an emerging nosocomial clone. Objectives: To report the genomic background and phylogenomic analysis of a multidrug-resistant NDM1-producing C. freundii ST18 (strain CF135931) isolated from an endangered green sea turtle affected by plastic pollution in Brazil. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. De novo assembly was performed by CLC Workbench, and in silico analysis accomplished by bioinformatics tools. For phylogenomic analysis, publicly available C. freundii (txid:546) genome assemblies were retrieved from the NCBI database. Results: The genome size was calculated at 5 290 351 bp, comprising 5263 total genes, 4 rRNAs, 77 tRNAs, 11ncRNAs, and 176 pseudogenes. The strain belonged to C. freundii ST18, whereas resistome analysis predicted genes encoding resistance to beta-lactams ( blaNDM-1 , blaOXA-1 , blaCMY-117 , and blaTEM-1C ), aminoglycosides ( aph(3' ')-Ib, aadA16, aph(3' )-VI, aac(6' )-Ib-cr, and aph(6)-Id ), quinolones ( aac(6' )-Ib-cr ), macrolides ( mph(A) and erm(B) ), sulphonamides ( sul1 and sul2 ), tetracyclines ( tetA and tetD ), and trimethoprim ( dfrA27 ). The phylogenomic analysis revealed that CF135931 strain is closely related to international human-associated ST18 clones producing NDM-1. Conclusion: Genomic surveillance effort s are necessary for robust monitoring of the emergence of drugresistant strains and WHO critical priority pathogens within a One Health framework. In this regard, this draft genome and associated data can improve understanding of dissemination dynamics of nosocomial clones of carbapenemase-producing C. freundii beyond hospital walls. In fact, the emergence of NDM-1producing C. freundii of global ST18 in wildlife deserves considerable attention. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Nanoemulsion As An Effective Inhibitor Of Biofilm-Forming Bacterial Associated Drug Resistance: An Insight Into Covid Based Nosocomial Infections,"Antibiotic overuse has resulted in the microevolution of drug-tolerant bacteria. Understandably it has become one of the most significant obstacles of the current century for scientists and researchers to overcome. Bacteria have a tendency to form biofilm as a survival mechanism. Biofilm producing microorganism become far more resistant to antimicrobial agents and their tolerance to drugs also increases. Prevention of biofilm development and curbing the virulency factors of these multi drug resistant or tolerant bacterial pathogens is a newly recognised tactic for overcoming the challenges associated with such bacterial infections and has become a niche to be addressed. In order to inhibit virulence and biofilm from planktonic bacteria such as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and others, stable nanoemulsions (NEs) of essential oils (EOs) and their bioactive compounds prove to be an interesting solution. These NEs demonstrated significantly greater anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activity than commercial antibiotics. The EO reduces disease-causing gene expression, which is required for pathogenicity, biofilm formation and attachment to the surfaces. Essential NE and NE-loaded hydrogel surface coatings demonstrates superior antibiofilm activity which can be employed in healthcare-related equipments like glass, plastic, and metal chairs, hospital beds, ventilators, catheters, and tools used in intensive care units. Thus, anti-virulence and anti-biofilm forming strategies based on NEs-loaded hydrogel may be used as coatings to combat biofilm-mediated infection on solid surfaces.","Raj, Ds; Dhamodharan, D; Thanigaivel, S; Vickram, As; Byun, Hs",10.1007/s12257-022-0055-3,Biotechnology And Bioprocess Engineering
Bacteriophage Treatment Before Chemical Disinfection Can Enhance Removal Of Plastic-Surface-Associated Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Opportunistic pathogens can linger on surfaces in hospital and building plumbing environments, leading to infections in at-risk populations. Furthermore, biofilm-associated bacteria are protected from removal and inactivation protocols such as disinfection. Bacteriophages show promise as tools to treat antibiotic-resistant infections. As such, phages may also be useful in environmental applications to prevent newly acquired infections. In the current study, the potential of synergies between bacteriophage and chemical disinfection against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed under various conditions. Specifically, surface-associated P. aeruginosa was treated with various concentrations of phages (P1 or JG004), chemical disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite or benzalkonium chloride), or combined sequential treatments under three distinct attachment models (spot inoculations, dry biofilms, and wet biofilms). Phages were very effective at removing bacteria in spot inoculations (>3.2 log(10) removal) and wet biofilms (up to 2.6 log(10) removal), while phages prevented the regrowth of dry biofilms in the application time. In addition, phage treatment followed by chemical disinfection inactivated P. aeruginosa cells under wet biofilm conditions better than either treatment alone. This effect was hindered when chemical disinfection was applied first, followed by phage treatment, suggesting that the additive benefits of combination treatments are lost when phage is applied last. Furthermore, we confirm previous evidence of greater phage tolerance to benzalkonium chloride than to sodium hypochlorite, informing choices for combination phage-disinfectant approaches. Overall, this paper further supports the potential of using combination phage and chemical disinfectant treatments to improve the inactivation of surface-associated P. aeruginosa. IMPORTANCE Phages are already utilized in the health care industry to treat antibiotic-resistant infections, such as those on implant-associated biofilms and in compassionate-care cases. Phage treatment could also be a promising new tool to control pathogens in the built environment, preventing infections from occurring. This study shows that phages can be combined effectively with chemical disinfectants to improve the removal of wet biofilms and bacteria spotted onto surfaces while preventing regrowth in dry biofilms. This has the potential to improve pathogen containment within the built environment and drinking water infrastructure to prevent infections by opportunistic pathogens.","Stachler, E; Kull, A; Julian, Tr",10.1128/AEM.00980-21,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
The Enterococcus: A Model Of Adaptability To Its Environment,"The genus Enterococcus comprises a ubiquitous group of Gram-positive bacteria that are of great relevance to human health for their role as major causative agents of health care-associated infections. The enterococci are resilient and versatile species able to survive under harsh conditions, making them well adapted to the health care environment. Two species cause the majority of enterococcal infections: Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Both species demonstrate intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics, such as virtually all cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, a remarkably plastic genome allows these two species to readily acquire resistance to further antibiotics, such as high-level aminoglycoside resistance, high-level ampicillin resistance, and vancomycin resistance, either through mutation or by horizontal transfer of genetic elements conferring resistance determinants.","García-Solache, M; Rice, Lb",10.1128/CMR.00058-18,Clinical Microbiology Reviews
Development Of Arg-Based Biodegradable Poly(Ester Urea) Urethanes And Its Biomedical Application For Bone Repair,"Thermal plastic polyurethanes (TPUs), serving as biomaterials, have become increasingly prevalent over time in many fields including artificial blood vessels, pericardial patches and other tissue engineering scaffolds by virtue of well adjustable performance. However, synthetic polyurethanes are, to some extent, inadequate for their cytocompatibility and biological activity owing to high hydrophobicity and lack of active groups. In this study, an amino-terminated bis(L-arginine) alkylene diester extender (L-Arg-8) was synthesized and Arg-based biodegradable poly(ester urea) urethanes (PEUUs) with different content of arginine groups were designed, synthesized and characterized in regard to the amelioration of the biodegradability, hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) with PCL as soft segments. Biodegradability, hydrophilicity and positive surface charges increased after Arginine was introduced. As cytocompatibility was improved, PEUU materials A8-1.2 and A8-1.6 were proved to be suitable for human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) to adhere, grow and proliferate on in vitro. These materials would unlock great potential for the use in tissue engineering and regeneration. Additionally, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were composited to PEUUs for further exploration to the applications in bone tissue. The addition of halloysite nanotubes further stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells in vitro. At the same time, a rat cranial defect model was built to assess effects of repair in vivo. Osteointegration and repair were promoted by patch-implanted groups. A8-1.2 6% HNTs showed the best repair. All the results indicated that Arg-based poly(ester urea) urethanes and the composites were conductive to bone repair.","Zhang, Yj; Huang, Kq; Yuan, Qj; Gu, Zp; Wu, G",10.1166/jbn.2019.2818,Journal Of Biomedical Nanotechnology
Structural Studies Of Klebsiella Pneumoniae Fosfomycin-Resistance Protein And Its Application For The Development Of An Optical Biosensor For Fosfomycin Determination,"Fosfomycin-resistance proteins (FosAs) are dimeric metal-dependent glutathione transferases that conjugate the antibiotic fosfomycin (Fos) to the tripeptide glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly, GSH), rendering it inactive. In the present study, we reported a comparative analysis of the functional features of two FosAs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FosAPA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (FosAKP). The coding sequences of the enzymes were cloned into a T7 expression vector, and soluble active enzymes were expressed in E. coli. FosAKP displayed higher activity and was selected for further studies. The crystal structure of the dimeric FosAKP was determined via X-ray crystallography at 1.48 & Aring; resolution. Fos and tartrate (Tar) were found bound in the active site of the first and second molecules of the dimer, respectively. The binding of Tar to the active site caused slight rearrangements in the structure and dynamics of the enzyme, acting as a weak inhibitor of Fos binding. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to measure the thermal stability of FosAKP under different conditions, allowing for the selection of a suitable buffer to maximize enzyme operational stability. FosAKP displays absolute specificity towards Fos; therefore, this enzyme was exploited for the development of an enzyme-based colorimetric biosensor. FosAKP was tethered at the bottom of a plastic cuvette using glutaraldehyde chemistry to develop a simple colorimetric method for the determination of Fos in drinking water and animal plasma.","Varotsou, C; Ataya, F; Papageorgiou, Ac; Labrou, Ne",10.3390/ijms25010085,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Washer Disinfector And Alkaline Detergent Ef Ficacy Against C. Difficile On Plastic Bedpans,"Background: Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of infectious antibiotic resistant diarrhea. C. difficile spores are shed in patient stool, are hearty and difficult to kill. Bedpans are often used by patients with C. difficile infections and require proper handling and cleaning or disposal to prevent the transmission of C. difficile spores and other infectious microorganisms into the environment. Disposable bedpans are often used for convenience, which has consequences from an environmental sustainability perspective. Aim: This study evaluates the ability for a washer-disinfector device (WD) to efficaciously clean and disinfect C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli from bedpans for sanitary reuse. Methods: A commercially available WD device was evaluated for both efficacy and thermal disinfection against C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli using one disinfection cycle per test. Bedpans were not rinsed or dumped prior to placement in the WD. Bedpans were sampled using swabs. Microorganisms were eluted from the swabs and log-kill was calculated. Findings: The average log-kill for C. difficile spores was 3.99 and >7.69 for E. coli. Thermal disinfection results showed an average log kill of 4.31 for C. difficile and >7.23 for E. coli. Conclusions: The WD was efficacious against both C. difficile spores and E. coli when used according to manufacturer's instructions for use, suggesting a viable alternative to disposable bedpan waste management.

Stable Closure Of Acute And Chronic Wounds And Pressure Ulcers And Control Of Draining Fistulas From Osteomyelitis In Persons With Spinal Cord Injuries: Non-Interventional Study Of Mppt Passive Immunotherapy Delivered Via Telemedicine In Community Care,"BackgroundMicropore particle technology (MPPT) is a topical wound treatment. It is a passive immunotherapy, acting via the skin and wound microbiome without the use of antimicrobial action. In a general patient population, it removed wound infections 60% and initiated tissue regeneration 50% quicker than antibiotics and antiseptics. As MPPT supports the immune system, the aim was to confirm that MPPT is also effective in immunocompromised individuals. People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are immunodeficient due to their injury and not an underlying disease and recruit 50% fewer immune cells to an injury. The study, therefore, determined the efficacy, safety, health economics, and sustainability of MPPT in acute and chronic wounds and pressure ulcers in this patient population.MethodsPressure ulcers in SCI persons are an orphan indication, patient variability is high, and ICH E10 excludes comparators due to ethical concerns. The study design was, therefore, a single-arm, non-interventional, observational, post-market surveillance study of MPPT for treating wounds and pressure ulcers and removing soft tissue infection in connection with draining fistulas in SCI persons. The study was based on telemedicine in community care.ResultsThe study included 44 wounds. All acute and chronic grade 1-4 wounds and pressure ulcers reached stable closure. In wounds acting as fistulas draining from an underlying, primary focus of infection, e.g., osteomyelitis, MPPT removed the soft tissue infection in approx. 2.5 months and supported regeneration, considerably reducing fistula sizes. Compared to standard care, per-wound cost savings were 51 to 94% depending on wound grade and age, and substantial nursing resources were freed up. The telemedicine approach was well received by participants and supported independence and self-care. The use of antimicrobials, plastics, and synthetic polymers was essentially eliminated. MPPT did not require bed rest.ConclusionThe study confirmed that MPPT is safe and effective in treating acute and chronic wounds in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, including wounds with antimicrobial-resistant infections. MPPT also removes soft tissue infections caused by an underlying primary focus of infection, such as osteomyelitis. Non-healing wounds currently represent an unmet clinical need. The findings suggest that a therapy acting via the microbiome without antimicrobial actions is effective.","Sams-Dodd, J; Belci, M; Bandi, S; Smith, D; Sams-Dodd, F",10.3389/fmed.2023.1279100,Frontiers In Medicine
Prevalence And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Of Salmonella Serovars Isolated From Us Retail Ground Pork,"One objective of this study was to determine overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from U.S. retail stores over three seasons including both case-ready and store-ground packages. Package types collected included: overwrap, chub, modified atmosphere packaging, and other (plastic or wax paper wrapped). Because package type represents different production systems and are subject to varied microbiological government regulation and testing methodologies, both USDA-FSIS and FDA Salmonella isolation protocols were performed. Another objective of the study was to determine serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates obtained from the ground pork samples. Ground pork aliquots were subjected to real-time PCR. Recovered isolates were serotyped and minimum inhibitory concentration analysis to 15 antimicrobials was determined using microbroth dilution. Overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from the 865 samples collected was 1.39%. Prevalence was not affected by package type (p = 0.29) nor grind location (case-ready vs. store-ground; p = 0.17). Season affected Salmonella prevalence (p = 0.05) with most isolates found during fall, and there was a tendency for geographic region to affect prevalence (p = 0.07). The USDA Salmonella isolation method was more effective at recovering isolates (p = 0.01) compared with the FDA methodology and yielded a kappa statistic of 0.26 as a measure of agreement. The serotypes isolated included: Infantis, 4,5,12:i:-, Brandenburg, Typhimurium var 5-, Seftenberg, and Johannesburg with only two packages containing multiple serotypes. No isolates were resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat human Salmonella infections including extended spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Although the recovery of Salmonella from retail ground pork samples was rare, Salmonella Typhimurium (and its monophasic variant 4,5,12:i:-), which are among the most common serovars recovered from human infections, were recovered. Therefore, more effective strategies to further reduce or eliminate these pathogens from retail pork products are warranted.","Broadway, Pr; Brooks, Jc; Mollenkopf, Df; Calle, Ma; Loneragan, Gh; Miller, Mf; Carroll, Ja; Sanchez, Ncb; Wittum, Te",10.1089/fpd.2020.2853,Foodborne Pathogens And Disease
Eradication And Sensitization Of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus To Methicillin With Bioactive Extracts Of Berry Pomace,"The therapeutic roles of phenolic blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomace (commercial byproduct) extracts (BPE) and their mechanism of actions were evaluated against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Five major phenolic acids of BPE, e.g., protocatechuic, p. coumaric, vanillic, caffeic, and gallic acids, as well as crude BPE completely inhibited the growth of vegetative MRSA in vitro while BPE + methicillin significantly reduced MRSA biofilm formation on plastic surface. In addition, BPE restored the effectiveness of methicillin against MRSA by down-regulating the expression of methicillin resistance (mecA) and efflux pump (norA, norB, norC, mdeA, sdrM, and sepA) genes. Antibiogram with broth microdilution method showed that MIC of methicillin reduced from 512 mu g/mL to 4 mu g/mL when combined with only 200 mu g Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/mL of BPE. Significant reduction in MRSA adherence to and invasion into human skin keratinocyte Hek001 cells were also noticed in the presence of BPE. BPE induced anti-apoptosis and anti-autophagy pathways through overexpression of Bcl-2 gene and down-regulation of TRADD and Bax genes (inducers of apoptosis pathway) in Hek001 cells. In summary, novel and sustainable prophylactic therapy can be developed with BPE in combination with currently available antibiotics, especially methicillin, against skin and soft tissue infections with MRSA.","Salaheen, S; Peng, Mf; Joo, J; Teramoto, H; Biswas, D",10.3389/fmicb.2017.00253,Frontiers In Microbiology
Antimicrobial Activity Of Amphiphilic Triazole-Linked Polymers Derived From Renewable Sources,"Conventional engineered polymers are strong, stable, and can interact desirably within the human body in implants and medical devices. However, bacterial colonization of medical devices and implants constructed from these materials results in numerous hospital acquired infections (HAI) and deaths each year. Polytriazole based plastics containing triazole rings and fatty acid derivatives have been synthesized from biological sources without catalysts or solvents. In this study, three amphiphilic polytriazoles with varying triazole density and hydrophilic/hydrophobic segments demonstrated broad spectrum, contact antimicrobial properties against both Gram positive and negative bacteria. SEM analysis of bacteria killed by these polymers evidence membrane damage, indicating that these polymers act by direct contact with bacterial membranes. Surface hydrophobicity of these polymers increased with increasing triazole group density, which also improved the antimicrobial efficacy. This work demonstrates that amphiphilic polytriazoles have antimicrobial properties and that future utilization of triazole modified polymers may produce self-sterilizing materials which resist bacterial contamination and formation of antibiotic resistant organisms, ideal characteristics for medically relevant biomaterials.","Floros, Mc; Bortolatto, Jf; Oliveira, Ob; Salvador, Sl; Narine, Ss",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5b00412,Acs Biomaterials Science & Engineering
"Etiology And Multi-Drug Resistant Profile Of Bacterial Infections In Severe Burn Patients, Romania 2018-2022","Infections in severe burns and their etiology are and will remain a big concern for the medical field. The multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria are a challenge of today's medicine. The aim of our study was to identify the etiological spectrum of bacterial infections in severe burn patients in Romania and their multi-drug resistant patterns. We performed a prospective study that included 202 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Clinical Emergency Hospital of Plastic, Reconstructive Surgery and Burns, Bucharest, Romania (CEHPRSB), from 1 October 2018 to 1 April 2022, a period which includes the first 2 years of the outbreak of COVID-19. From each patient, wound swabs, endotracheal aspirates, blood for blood culture, and urine were collected. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (39%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12%), Klebsiella spp. (11%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (9%). More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were MDR, regardless of the clinical specimen from which they were isolated.","Nitescu, B; Pitigoi, D; Talapan, D; Nitescu, M; Arama, Ss; Pavel, B; Streinu-Cercel, A; Rafila, A; Arama, V",10.3390/medicina59061143,Medicina-Lithuania

Microglia In Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is one of most common chronic neurological disorders, and the antiseizure medications developed by targeting neurocentric mechanisms have not effectively reduced the proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Further exploration of the cellular or molecular mechanism of epilepsy is expected to provide new options for treatment. Recently, more and more researches focus on brain network components other than neurons, among which microglia have attracted much attention for their diverse biological functions. As the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia have highly plastic transcription, morphology and functional characteristics, which can change dynamically in a context-dependent manner during the progression of epilepsy. In the pathogenesis of epilepsy, highly reactive microglia interact with other components in the epileptogenic network by performing crucial functions such as secretion of soluble factors and phagocytosis, thus continuously reshaping the landscape of the epileptic brain microenvironment. Indeed, microglia appear to be both pro-epileptic and anti-epileptic under the different spatiotemporal contexts of disease, rendering interventions targeting microglia biologically complex and challenging. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the pathophysiological role of microglia in epileptic brain homeostasis alterations and explores potential therapeutic or modulatory targets for epilepsy targeting microglia.","Yu, C; Deng, Xj; Xu, D",10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106249,Neurobiology Of Disease

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Contamination Of Hospital-Use-Only Mobile Phones And Efficacy Of 222-Nm Ultraviolet Disinfection,"Background: Mobile phones may be contaminated with nosocomial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The aim of this study was to investigate the MRSA contamination rate on doctors' hospital-use-only mobile phones and the efficacy of 222-nm ultraviolet light (UV) disinfection. Methods: We investigated the MRSA contamination rate of doctors' hospital-use-only mobile phones, as well as the reduction in MRSA counts on plastic plates and aerobic bacteria (AB) on mobile phones before and after exposure to 222-nm UV irradiation. Results: Five (10%) of the 50 mobile phones investigated were contaminated with MRSA. Exposure to 0.1 mJ/cm(2) 222-nm UVC irradiation for 1.5 and 2.5 min (9 and 15 mJ/cm(2)) achieved mean log(10) MRSA colony-forming units reductions of 2.91 and 3.95, respectively. Exposure to 9 mJ/cm2 222-nm UVC irradiation (0.1 mW/cm(2) for 1.5 minutes) significantly reduced AB contamination on mobile phones (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of 222-nm UV disinfection resulted in effective in vitro reduction of MRSA and significantly reduced AB contamination of mobile phone surfaces.

Decontaminating Surfaces With Atomized Disinfectants Generated By A Novel Thickness-Mode Lithium Niobate Device,"We evaluated the ability of a novel lithium niobate (LN) thickness-mode device to atomize disinfectants and reduce microbial burden on model surface materials. A small-scale plastic model housed the LN thickness-mode device and circular coupon surface materials including polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and natural rubber. Coupon surfaces were coated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii), atomized with disinfectant solutions of varying viscosity (including 10% bleach, 70% ethanol (EtOH), or 25% triethylene glycol (TEG)) using the LN thickness-mode device, and assessed for surviving bacteria. The LN thickness-mode device effectively atomized disinfectants ranging from low viscosity 10% bleach solution or 70% EtOH to highly viscous 25% TEG. Coupons harboring MDR bacteria and atomized with 10% bleach solution or 70% EtOH were effectively decontaminated with 100% bacterial elimination. Atomized 25% TEG effectively eliminated 100% of K. pneumoniae (CRE) from contaminated coupon surfaces but not MRSA. The enclosed small-scale plastic model established proof-of-principle that the LN thickness-mode device could atomize disinfectants of varying viscosities and decontaminate coupon surface materials harboring MDR organisms. Future studies evaluating scaled devices for patient rooms are warranted to determine their utility in hospital environmental decontamination.","Kumaraswamy, M; Collignon, S; Do, C; Kim, J; Nizet, V; Friend, J",10.1007/s00253-018-9088-0,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
"Antibiotic Resistance Patterns Of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales In Mohammed Vi University Hospital Of Marrakech, Morocco","Objectives: The emergence and spread of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has become a growing concern for health services, internationally, nationally, and regionally. In Morocco, the situation is more worrisome as studies on CRE are scarce and/or scattered and/or outdated. As a result, we carried out the present study to determine and update CRE prevalence at Mohammed VI University Hospital of Marrakech, Morocco. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was carried out from March 2018 to March 2020 on 41161 clinical specimens of 23,469 patients suspected of bacterial infections. Enterobacterales strains were isolated following standard bacteriological procedures. Bacterial strains were identified using BD-Phoenix and MALDI-TOF-MS. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined for 14 antibiotics. Carbapenemase production and phenotypic detection were characterized using modified carbapenem inactivation phenotypic and immunochromatographic methods. Results: All in all, 484 Enterobaterales resistant to at least one carbapenem were recovered. The majority was isolated from the neonatal unit (14%), followed by the urology-nephrology (11%), and plastic surgery departments (10%). K. pneumoniae (n = 232) was the most isolated, followed by E. cloacae (n = 148), E. coli (n = 56), and S. marcescens (n = 17). Antibiotic susceptibility profile showed high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (75.21%), gentamicin (84.50%), and cotrimoxazole (88.42%). Out of 484 CRE positive cultures, 388 (80.16%) were Carbapenemase-positive. Out of the latter, 170 were metallo-beta-lactamase producers (NDM), 162 OXA-48-like, and 56 both. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the urgent need for control precautions and strict measures to contain and mitigate this issue. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Biofilm Of Petroleum-Based And Bio-Based Microplastics In Seawater In Response To Zn(Ii): Biofilm Formation, Community Structure, And Microbial Function","Microplastic biofilms are novel vectors for the transport and spread of pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria. With the increasing use of bio-based plastics, there is an urgent need to investigate the microbial colonization characteristics of these materials in seawater, particularly in comparison with conventional petroleum-based plastics. Furthermore, the effect of co-occurring contaminants, such as heavy metals, on the formation of microplastic biofilms and bacterial communities remains unclear. In this study, we compared the biofilm bacterial community structure of petroleum-based polyethylene (PE) and bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) in seawater under the influence of zinc ions (Zn2+). Our findings indicate that the biofilm on PLA microplastics in the late stage was impeded by the formation of a mildly acidic microenvironment resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester group on PLA. The PE surface had higher bacterial abundance and diversity, with a more intricate symbiotic pattern. The bacterial structures on the two types of microplastics were different; PE was more conducive to the colonization of anaerobic bacteria, whereas PLA was more favorable for the colonization of aerobic and acidtolerant species. Furthermore, Zn increased the proportion of the dominant genera that could utilize microplastics as a carbon source, such as Alcanivorax and Nitratireductor. PLA had a greater propensity to harbor and disseminate pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria, and Zn promoted the enrichment and spread of harmful bacteria such as, Pseudomonas and Clostridioides.

The Arc Gene: Retroviral Heritage In Cognitive Functions,"Stabilization of neuronal plastic changes is mediated by transient gene expression, including transcription of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated gene (Arc), also known as Arg 3.1. Arc is implicated in several types of synaptic plasticity, including synaptic scaling, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression. However, the precise mechanisms by which Arc mediates these forms of long-term plasticity are unclear. It was recently found that Arc protein is capable of forming capsid-like structures and of transferring its own mRNA to neighboring cells. Moreover, Arc mRNA undergoes activity-dependent translation in these transfected cells. These new data raise unexpected possibilities for the mechanisms of the Arc action, and many intriguing questions concerning the role of Arc transcellular traffic in neuronal plasticity. In this mini-review, we discuss a possible link between the role of Arc in learning and memory and the virus-like properties of this protein. Additionally, we highlight some of the emerging questions for future neurobiological studies and translational applications of Arc trans synaptic effects.","Kedrov, Av; Durymanov, M; Anokhin, Kv",10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.02.006,Neuroscience And Biobehavioral Reviews
Analysis And Management Of Pathogens Isolated From Patients With Complicated Facial Lacerations And Abrasions,"Plastic surgeons commonly encounter patients with facial lacerations and/or abrasions in the emergency room. If they are properly treated, facial wounds generally heal well without complications. However, infection can sometimes cause delayed wound healing. We performed wound culture for the early detection of infection and to promote the healing of infected facial wounds. We included 5033 patients with facial wounds who visited the emergency room of Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital between January 2018 and February 2021. Among them, 104 patients underwent wound culture. We analysed the pathogens isolated and the patients' age, sex, wound site, mechanism of injury, wound healing time, time from injury to culture, time to culture results, and dressing methods used. Pathogens were isolated in slightly less than half of the patients (38.46%); among them, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common (47.5%). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated in six (15%) patients. Patients with complicated wounds had a longer mean wound healing time (10.83 +/- 5.91 days) than those with non-complicated wounds (6.06 +/- 1.68 days). Wound culture of complicated facial wounds resulted in the isolation of various types of pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi. We recommend the use of wound culture for early detection of infection to prevent delayed wound healing.","Shin, Sh; Woo, Ss; Lee, Jh; Kim, Hj; Kim, Sh; Kim, Jh; Suh, Is",10.1111/iwj.13842,International Wound Journal
"The Chlamydia Suis Genome Exhibits High Levels Of Diversity, Plasticity, And Mobile Antibiotic Resistance: Comparative Genomics Of A Recent Livestock Cohort Shows Influence Of Treatment Regimes","Chlamydia suis is an endemic pig pathogen, belonging to a fascinating genus of obligate intracellular pathogens. Of particular interest, this is the only chlamydial species to have naturally acquired genes encoding for tetracycline resistance. To date, the distribution and mobility of the Tet-island are not well understood. Our study focused on whole genome sequencing of 29 C. suis isolates from a recent porcine cohort within Switzerland, combined with data from USA tetracycline-resistant isolates. Our findings show that the genome of C. suis is very plastic, with unprecedented diversity, highly affected by recombination and plasmid exchange. A large diversity of isolates circulates within Europe, even within individual Swiss farms, suggesting that C. suis originated around Europe. New World isolates have more restricted diversity and appear to derive from European isolates, indicating that historical strain transfers to the United States have occurred. The architecture of the Tet-island is variable, but the tetA(C) gene is always intact, and recombination has been a major factor in its transmission within C. suis. Selective pressure from tetracycline use within pigs leads to a higher number of Tet-island carrying isolates, which appear to be lost in the absence of such pressure, whereas the loss or gain of the Tet-island from individual strains is not observed. The Tet-island appears to be a recent import into the genome of C. suis, with a possible American origin.","Seth-Smith, Hmb; Wanninger, S; Bachmann, N; Marti, H; Qi, Wh; Donati, M; Di Francesco, A; Polkinghorne, A; Borel, N",10.1093/gbe/evx043,Genome Biology And Evolution
"Homologous Stress Adaptation, Antibiotic Resistance, And Biofilm Forming Ability Of Salmonella Enterica Serovar Heidelberg Atcc8326 On Different Food-Contact Surfaces Following Exposure To Sublethal Chlorine Concentrations","Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC 8326) was examined for the ability to adapt to the homologous stress of chlorine through exposure to increasing chlorine concentrations (25 ppm daily increments) in tryptic soy broth (TSB). The tested strain exhibited an acquired tolerance to chlorine in TSB with the tolerant cells growing in concentrations up to 400 ppm. In addition, the chlorine stressed cells displayed rugose morphology on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates at 37 degrees C. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chlorine for adapted (rugose and smooth) cells was determined to be 550 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively whereas the MIC for the control was 450 ppm. The biofilm forming ability of the adapted and control cells were examined on both plastic and stainless steel surface at room temperature and 37 degrees C. The rugose variant, in contrast to the smooth (adapted and control) showed the ability to form strong biofilms (P = 0.05) on a plastic surface at room temperature and 37 degrees C. Rugose cells compared to smooth and control attached more (P = 0.05) to steel surfaces as well. The possibility of cross-adaptation was examined by exposing the adapted and control cells to different antibiotics according to the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Adapted cells exhibited reduced susceptibility to some of the antibiotics tested as compared to control. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to sublethal chlorine concentration during the sanitization procedure can result in tolerant Salmonella cells. Chlorine may confer cross-protection that aids in the survival of the tolerant population to other environmental stresses.","Obe, T; Nannapaneni, R; Sharma, Cs; Kiess, A",10.3382/ps/pex346,Poultry Science
"Shining Light On Multi-Drug Resistant Candida Auris: Ultraviolet-C Disinfection, Wavelength Sensitivity, And Prevention Of Biofilm Formation Of An Emerging Yeast Pathogen","Candida auris is an emerging fungal superbug of worldwide interest. It is associated with high mortality rates and exhibits increased resistance to antifungals. Ultraviolet subtype C (UVC) light can be used to disinfect surfaces to mitigate its spread. The objectives of this study were (1) To investigate UVC disinfection performances and wavelength sensitivity of C. auris. (2) To evaluate the UVC dose required for the prevention of biofilm formation on stainless-steel, plastic (polystyrene), and poly-cotton fabric surfaces. C. auris was grown following standard procedures. The study utilized six different UVC LED arrays with wavelengths between 252 and 280 nm. Arrays were set at similar intensities, to obtain doses of 5-40 mJ cm(-2) and similar irradiation time. Disinfection performance for each array was determined using log reduction value (LRV) and percentage reduction by comparing the controls against the irradiated treatments. Evaluation of the ability of 267 nm UVC LEDs to prevent C. auris biofilm formation was investigated using stainless-steel, plastic coupons, and poly-cotton fabric. Peak sensitivity to UVC disinfection was between 267 and 270 nm. With 20 mJ cm(-2), the study obtained >= LRV3. On stainless-steel coupons, 30 mJ cm(-2) was sufficient to prevent biofilm formation, while on plastic, this required 10 mJ cm(-2). A dose of 60 mJ cm(-2) reduced biofilms on poly-cotton fabric significantly (R-2 = 0.9750, p = 0.0002).

Current Levels Of Microplastic Pollution Impact Wild Seabird Gut Microbiomes,"Consuming microplastics is known to harm marine wildlife in several ways, but effects on the microbiome are understudied. Here the authors demonstrate that two species of wild seabirds with larger amounts of microplastic in their guts had fewer commensal gut microbial species but more pathogens. Microplastics contaminate environments worldwide and are ingested by numerous species, whose health is affected in multiple ways. A key dimension of health that may be affected is the gut microbiome, but these effects are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated if microplastics are associated with changes in proventricular and cloacal microbiomes in two seabird species that chronically ingest microplastics: northern fulmars and Cory's shearwaters. The amount of microplastics in the gut was significantly correlated with gut microbial diversity and composition: microplastics were associated with decreases in commensal microbiota and increases in (zoonotic) pathogens and antibiotic-resistant and plastic-degrading microbes. These results illustrate that environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations and mixtures are associated with changes in gut microbiomes in wild seabirds.","Fackelmann, G; Pham, Ck; Rodríguez, Y; Mallory, Ml; Provencher, Jf; Baak, Je; Sommer, S",10.1038/s41559-023-02013-z,Nature Ecology & Evolution
Polystyrene Nanoplastics Of Different Particle Sizes Regulate The Polarization Of Pro-Inflammatory Macrophages,"Microplastics (MPs) are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in size, and nanoplastics (NPs) are those MPs with a particle size of less than 1000 nm or 100 nm. The prevalence of MPs in the environment and human tissues has raised concerns about their potential negative effects on human health. Macrophages are the major defence against foreign substances in the intestine, and can be polarized into two types: the M1 phenotype and the M2 phenotype. However, the effect of NPs on the polarization of macrophages remains unclear. Herein, we selected polystyrene, one of the most plastics in the environment and controlled the particle sizes at 50 nm and 500 nm respectively to study the effects on the polarization of macrophages. We used mouse RAW264.7 cell line models in this macrophage-associated study. Experiments on cell absorption showed that macrophages could quickly ingest polystyrene nanoplastics of both diameters with time-dependent uptake. Compared to the untreated group and 10 mu g/mL treatment group, macrophages exposed to 50 mu g/mL groups (50 nm and 500 nm) had considerably higher levels of CD86, iNOS, and TNF-alpha, but decreased levels of aCD206, IL-10, and Arg-1. According to these findings, macrophage M1 and M2 polarization can both be induced and inhibited by 50 mu g/mL 50 nm and 500 nm polystyrene nanoplastics. This work provided the first evidence of a possible MPs mode of action with appropriate concentration and size through the production of polarized M1, providing dietary and environmental recommendations for people, particularly those with autoimmune and autoinflammatory illnesses.","Jiang, Wl; Liu, Yl; Wu, Yq; Zhang, L; Zhang, Bq; Zhou, Sl; Zhang, P; Xu, T; Wu, M; Lv, Sw",10.1038/s41598-024-67289-y,Scientific Reports
"Microplastic Distributions In A Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant: Removal Efficiency, Seasonal Variation And Influence Of Sampling Technique","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as an important route of microplastics (MPs) to the environment. Therefore, more effective MPs sampling and detection methodologies, as well as a better understanding of their influence on MPs occurrence and distributions in WWTP effluents, are needed for better removal and control. In this work, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs was assessed by collecting samples from raw to tertiary effluent during a 12-month sampling campaign (season-based) using different sampling methods (containers, 24-h composite and large grab samples). MPs retrieved from different treatment units within the WWTP were identified and quantified using plastic/non-plastic staining followed by optical microscopy, SEM and mu-Raman microscopy. Overall, the mean removal efficiency of MPs in the WWTP was 97%, with most MPs removed by the secondary stage and a mean effluent concentration of 1.97MPs L-1 after sand filtration. The relative abundance of particles was lower than fibers in treated effluent compared with the raw wastewater, with MP fibers constituting 74% of the total MPs in raw wastewater and 91% in treated effluent. Taking seasonal variations into account is important as total MPs concentration in the effluent was notably higher in winter compared with the other seasons. Increasing the sampled volume using large samples or 24-h composite samples significantly reduced the variability between replicates. However, MPs concentration post the tertiary stage was significantly lower using morning sampling (9 am) by large grab sampling method (1.2 MPs L-1) compared to 24-h composite sampling (3.2 MPs L-1) possibly due to intra-daily changes. Using a finer mesh size (0.45 mu m) to captureMPs beyond the size range typically studied (>= 20 mu m) effectively doubled the number of MPs detected in the tertiary effluent and highlights the importance of standardizing sampling procedures.

White Stork Movements Reveal The Ecological Connectivity Between Landfills And Different Habitats,"BackgroundConnections between habitats are key to a full understanding of anthropic impacts on ecosystems. Freshwater habitats are especially biodiverse, yet depend on exchange with terrestrial habitats. White storks (Ciconia ciconia) are widespread opportunists that often forage in landfills and then visit wetlands, among other habitats. It is well known that white storks ingest contaminants at landfills (such as plastics and antibiotic resistant bacteria), which can be then deposited in other habitats through their faeces and regurgitated pellets.MethodsWe characterized the role of white storks in habitat connectivity by analyzing GPS data from populations breeding in Germany and wintering from Spain to Morocco. We overlaid GPS tracks on a land-use surface to construct a spatially-explicit network in which nodes were sites, and links were direct flights. We then calculated centrality metrics, identified spatial modules, and quantified overall connections between habitat types. For regional networks in southern Spain and northern Morocco, we built Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to explain network topologies as a response to node habitat.ResultsFor Spain and Morocco combined, we built a directed spatial network with 114 nodes and 370 valued links. Landfills were the habitat type most connected to others, as measured by direct flights. The relevance of landfills was confirmed in both ERGMs, with significant positive effects of this habitat as a source of flights. In the ERGM for southern Spain, we found significant positive effects of rice fields and salines (solar saltworks) as sinks for flights. By contrast, in the ERGM for northern Morocco, we found a significant positive effect of marshes as a sink for flights.ConclusionsThese results illustrate how white storks connect landfills with terrestrial and aquatic habitats, some of which are managed for food production. We identified specific interconnected habitat patches across Spain and Morocco that could be used for further studies on biovectoring of pollutants, pathogens and other propagules.","López-Calderón, C; Martín-Vélez, V; Blas, J; Höfle, U; Sánchez, Mi; Flack, A; Fiedler, W; Wikelski, M; Green, Aj",10.1186/s40462-023-00380-7,Movement Ecology
A Live Single-Cell Reporter System Reveals Drug-Induced Plasticity Of A Cancer Stem Cell-Like Population In Cholangiocarcinoma,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) play an important role in carcinogenesis and are acknowledged to be responsible for chemoresistance in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Studying CCA CSC has been challenging, due to lack of consensus CSC markers, and to their plastic nature. Since dual expression of the core pluripotent factors SOX2/OCT4 has been shown to correlate with poor outcome in CCA patients, we selected the SOX2/OCT4 activating short half-life GFP-based live reporter (SORE6-dsCopGFP) to study CSC dynamics at the single-cell level. Transduction of five human CCA cell lines resulted in the expression of 1.8-13.1% GFP-positive (SORE6POS) cells. By live imaging, we found that SORE6POS CCA cells possess self-renewal capacity and that they can be induced to differentiate. Significantly, the SORE6POS cells were highly tumorigenic, both in vitro and in vivo, thus implicating the characteristics of primary CSCs. When we then analyzed for selected CSC-related markers, we found that the majority of both CD133+/CD44+, and CD133+/LGR5+ CCA cells were SORE6POS cells. Exposing transduced cells to standard CCA chemotherapy revealed higher growth rate inhibition at 50% (GR50s) for SORE6POS cells compared to GFP-negative (SORE6NEG) ones indicating that these CSC-like cells were more resistant to the treatment. Moreover, the chemotherapy induced SORE6POS from SORE6NEG cells, while retaining the existing SORE6POS population. Finally, treatment of transduced cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro for 3 days resulted in a lowered CSC number in the culture. Thus, applying a live reporter system allowed us to elucidate the stem cell diversity and drug-induced plasticity of CCA CSCs. These findings have clear implications for future management of such patients.","Kongtanawanich, K; Prasopporn, S; Jamnongsong, S; Thongsin, N; Payungwong, T; Okada, S; Hokland, M; Wattanapanitch, M; Jirawatnotai, S",10.1038/s41598-024-73581-8,Scientific Reports
Presence Of Listeria Monocytogenes In Ready-To-Eat Meat Products Sold At Retail Stores In Costa Rica And Analysis Of Contributing Factors,"Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium associated with ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products sold at the retail level. The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products sold at retail in Costa Rica and to study the factors associated with the levels of contamination; analyzed factors include hygienic practices within stores (cutting techniques and microbial contamination of products) and the behavior of the isolates (persistence against antimicrobials and transfer potential). A total of 190 samples of RTE meat products were collected and analyzed for the presence of coliforms and Listeria spp. Isolates of L. monocytogenes were then evaluated in terms of resistance to disinfectants (quaternary ammonium compound [QAC] and chlorine) and their transfer potential from food contact surfaces (knife and cutting boards). Overall Listeria spp. prevalence was 37.4% (71 of 190); Listeria innocua was present in 32.1% (61 of 190) of the products, and L. monocytogenes was found in just 2.6% (5 of 190) of the samples. Most contaminated samples were cut with a knife at the moment of purchase (44.2%). When analyzing practices within the stores, it was observed that L. monocytogenes transfer from inoculated knife to salchichon was higher for samples cut at the beginning of the experiment. In addition, L. monocytogenes transfer from inoculated cutting boards was independent of the number of slices but contamination from plastic was higher than wood. Regarding L. monocytogenes resistance to disinfectants, average reductions of 2.6 6 1.1 log CFU/mL were detected after 6 min of exposure to 200 ppm of chlorine; however, chlorine resistance varied among the strains. Prevalence of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products sold at retail could be associated with handling practices within the stores; further studies are necessary to estimate the impact of these practices on the overall risk for consumers.","Calvo-Arrieta, K; Matamoros-Montoya, K; Arias-Echandi, Ml; Huete-Soto, A; Redondo-Solano, M",10.4315/JFP-21-020,Journal Of Food Protection
Evaluation Of The Efficacy Of Uv-C Radiation In Eliminating Microorganisms Of Special Epidemiological Importance From Touch Surfaces Under Laboratory Conditions And In The Hospital Environment,"Introduction: Healthcare-associated infections in the post-pandemic era are as important as they were before COVID-19. The dominant route of transmission of microorganisms in health care units is the contact route, for which hand hygiene is of cardinal importance, but also effective disinfection of touch surfaces. Traditional disinfection based on chemical compounds is sensitive to human errors. Therefore, a valuable supplement to it can be contactless disinfection methods, including the use of UV-C. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of UV-C radiation in eliminating selected, most important pathogens of particular epidemic importance from surfaces made of various materials: stainless steel, plastic and glass, most often found in hospital conditions. Material and Method: In laboratory conditions, the study was conducted using bacterial strains of great epidemiological importance and Candida auris. In hospital wards, samples were taken before and after disinfection for comparisons of the composition and quantity of bacteria. In laboratory conditions, carriers made of steel, plastic and glass were contaminated with a bacterial suspension with a density of approx. 0.5 McFarland, and then the density of persistent microorganisms was assessed after 10 min of UV-C irradiation. Results: The high effectiveness of UV-C radiation in eliminating bacteria contaminating touch surfaces in hospital wards and in laboratory conditions has been confirmed. The elimination efficiency in laboratory conditions was slightly lower (statistically insignificant) on the plastic surface, which is probably related to subtle differences in the thickness of the contaminating layer. Hydrophobic properties and the smallest suspension diameter were confirmed for the tested plastic carriers. Conclusions: UV-C disinfection is a desirable element to support traditional, chemical methods of disinfection in hospital conditions, effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria and C. auris.","Rozanska, A; Walkowicz, M; Bulanda, M; Kasperski, T; Synowiec, E; Osuch, P; Chmielarczyk, A",10.3390/healthcare11233096,Healthcare
Successful Treatment With Hla-Matched Peripheral Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation For Very Severe Hepatitis-Associated Aplastic Anemia Complicated With Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial And Fungal Infections: A Case Report,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a life-threatening hematologic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the first-line treatment for HAAA. Severe infection and complications in patients with very severe aplastic anemia are the challenges to the efficacy of HSCT. We report a rare case of successful transplantation with HLA-matched peripheral hematopoietic stem cells for a 15-year-old girl suffering from HAAA with multidrug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections. Through effectively controlling infection and optimal timing of transplantation by adjusting the conditioning regimen, the allo-HSCT was successfully performed for the patient. Updated data of following-up 26 months after transplantation showed that the patient was still in complete remission with a good quality of life. This case provided a reference for treating severely infected patients with HAAA before HSCT.","Li, H; Li, Xf; Chen, Xl; Li, Nn",10.3389/fped.2022.828918,Frontiers In Pediatrics
Sensitization Of Ht29 Colorectal Cancer Cells To Vemurafenib In Three-Dimensional Collagen Cultures,"The extracellular matrix to which cancer cells adhere affects cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. We sought to examine the changes in sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells carrying the BRAF V600E mutation to vemurafenib cultured in three-dimensional (3D) collagen-I gels, while also identifying the signaling pathways involved in these changes. HT29 colorectal cancer cells were cultured in conventional tissue culture (TC) plastic plates or in collagen-I gels. The HT29 cells demonstrated approximately 10-fold higher sensitivity to vemurafenib in 3D-collagen-I gels compared with those cultured on conventional TC plastic plates. Furthermore, in cells cultured on TC plastic, vemurafenib was found to augment tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), while 3D-cultured cells expressed lower levels of FAK and vemurafenib did not affect its tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that FAK contributes to vemurafenib resistance. However, pharmacological inhibition of FAK did not sensitize the cells to vemurafenib. Also, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB2 family proteins was found to be lower in cells cultured in 3D-collagen gel compared with those in cells cultured on TC plastic. Afatinib, an inhibitor of the EGFR/ERBB family of kinases, sensitized the cells to higher concentrations of vemurafenib, implying their participation in vemurafenib resistance. Adhesion to collagen-I gel but not to the collagen-I-coated plastic surface sensitized the cells, suggesting that the rigidity of the media rather than adherence to collagen-I may be important for cellular sensitivity to vemurafenib.","Kikuchi, K; Hoshino, D",10.1002/cbin.11262,Cell Biology International
The Use Of Autologous And Cadaveric Grafts In Rhinoplasty: A Survey Study,"Background Both autologous and cadaveric grafts are often used during rhinoplasty to create volume and provide support. Despite discussion in the literature comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and complication rates between grafting options, it remains unclear which is the superior choice when considering availability, donor site morbidity, and cost. There is a little description of the current use of these materials amongst facial plastic surgeons. Methods A 12 question survey was created, and IRB approval was obtained. The survey was distributed to practicing members of the AAFPRS via their membership listserv. Results 178 respondents completed the survey for an overall response rate of 17.5%. The most common rhinoplasty graft types used by respondents were autologous septal cartilage (96.6%), autologous auricular grafts (93.8%), autologous rib graft (ARG) (75.8%), and cadaveric rib graft (CRG) (56.7%). Patient comorbidities and performing more than 50 rhinoplasties per year were positively correlated with use of CRG grafts and concerns about complications and cost were negatively correlated. Conclusions While autologous septal and auricular cartilage remain the most common graft choices amongst surveyed facial plastic surgeons, a majority utilize cadaveric rib grafts in their practice. Patient comorbidities, surgery volume, concerns about graft complications, and cost were the chief factors associated with use of cadaveric grafts amongst survey respondents.","Starr, Nc; Porterfield, Jz; Harryman, C; Gupta, N",10.1007/s00266-021-02752-z,Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
Ecological Influences Of The Migration Of Micro Resin Particles From Crushed Waste Printed Circuit Boards On The Dumping Soil,"About 0.8 million tons of resin particles, which were generated from the recovery of waste printed circuit boards, were dumped on soil at Qingyuan city of China. Resin particles not only belong to micro plastic but also contain brominated flame retardants and heavy metals. There is little information about soil pollution caused by the dumped resin particles. This study found resin particles would transfer from soil surface into soil at least 10 mm downward for six months. Average content of bromine in soil within 10 cm exceeded 2500 mg/kg. The highest content of Pb, Zn, and Cu was 3450, 1143 and 1450 mg/kg, which were approximately 6.9, 2.3 and 3.6 times as much as Grade III soil standard of China. Micro plastic, brominated flame retardants, and heavy metals made significant effects on soil bacterial community. Bacterial diversity was destroyed and the number of resistant bacteria increased obviously such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Paracoccus. This paper presented the ecological destroy of soil when the resin particles were deposited on soil surface. It also suggested the government to urgently manage the resin particles produced in the recovery of waste printed circuit boards.","Li, Yy; Lin, M; Ni, Zb; Yuan, Zh; Liu, Wq; Ruan, Jj; Tang, Yt; Qiu, Rl",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121020,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antimicrobial Efficacy Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Biofilm Formation In A Three-Dimensional Lung Epithelial Model And The Influence Of Fetal Bovine Serum,"In vitro models that mimic in vivo host-pathogen interactions are needed to evaluate candidate drugs that inhibit bacterial virulence traits. We established a new approach to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm susceptibility on biotic surfaces, using a three-dimensional (3-D) lung epithelial cell model. P. aeruginosa formed antibiotic resistant biofilms on 3-D cells without affecting cell viability. The biofilm-inhibitory activity of antibiotics and/or the anti-biofilm peptide DJK-5 were evaluated on 3-D cells compared to a plastic surface, in medium with and without fetal bovine serum (FBS). In both media, aminoglycosides were more efficacious in the 3-D cell model. In serum-free medium, most antibiotics (except polymyxins) showed enhanced efficacy when 3-D cells were present. In medium with FBS, colistin was less efficacious in the 3-D cell model. DJK-5 exerted potent inhibition of P. aeruginosa association with both substrates, only in serum-free medium. DJK-5 showed stronger inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa associated with plastic compared to 3-D cells. The combined addition of tobramycin and DJK-5 exhibited more potent ability to inhibit P. aeruginosa association with both substrates. In conclusion, lung epithelial cells influence the efficacy of most antimicrobials against P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, which in turn depends on the presence or absence of FBS.","Crabbé, A; Liu, Yl; Matthijs, N; Rigole, P; De La Fuente-Nùñez, C; Davis, R; Ledesma, Ma; Sarker, S; Van Houdt, R; Hancock, Rew; Coenye, T; Nickerson, Ca",10.1038/srep43321,Scientific Reports
Antibacterial Insights Into Alternariol And Its Derivative Alternariol Monomethyl Ether Produced By A Marine Fungus,"Alternaria alternata FB1 is a marine fungus identified as a candidate for plastic degradation in our previous study. This fungus has been recently shown to produce secondary metabolites with significant antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the notorious aquaculture pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. The antibacterial compounds were purified and identified as alternariol (AOH) and its derivative, alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). We found that AOH and AME primarily inhibited pathogenic bacteria (MRSA or V. anguillarum) by disordering cell division and some other key physiological and biochemical processes. We further demonstrated that AOH could effectively inhibit the unwinding activity of MRSA topoisomerases, which are closely related to cell division and are the potential action target of AOH. The antibacterial activities of AOH and AME were verified by using zebrafish as the in vivo model. Notably, AOH and AME did not significantly affect the viability of normal human liver cells at concentrations that effectively inhibited MRSA or V. anguillarum. Finally, we developed the genetic operation system of A. alternata FB1 and blocked the biosynthesis of AME by knocking out omtI (encoding an O-methyl transferase), which facilitated A. alternata FB1 to only produce AOH. The development of this system in the marine fungus will accelerate the discovery of novel natural products and further bioactivity study. IMPORTANCE More and more scientific reports indicate that alternariol (AOH) and its derivative alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) exhibit antibacterial activities. However, limited exploration of their detailed antibacterial mechanisms has been performed. In the present study, the antibacterial mechanisms of AOH and AME produced by the marine fungus Alternaria alternata FB1 were disclosed in vitro and in vivo. Given their low toxicity on the normal human liver cell line under the concentrations exhibiting significant antibacterial activity against different pathogens, AOH and AME are proposed to be good candidates for developing promising antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio anguillarum. We also succeeded in blocking the biosynthesis of AME, which facilitated us to easily obtain pure AOH. Moreover, based on our previous results, A. alternata FB1 was shown to enable polyethylene degradation.","Li, Rm; Su, Zj; Sun, Cm; Wu, Sm",10.1128/aem.00058-24,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
An Efficient And Novel Technology For The Extraction Of Parasite Genomic Dna From Whole Blood Or Culture,"The aim of this study was to assess pathogen DNA extraction with a new spin column-based method (DNA-XT). DNA from either whole-blood samples spiked with Plasmodium falciparum or Leishmania donovani amastigote culture was extracted with DNA-XT and compared with that produced by a commercial extraction kit (DNeasy((R))). Eluates from large and small sample volumes were assessed by PCR and spectroscopy. Using a small volume (5 mu l) of blood, the DNA-XT and DNeasy methods produced eluates with similar DNA concentrations (0.63 vs 1.06 ng/mu l, respectively). The DNA-XT method produced DNA with lower PCR inhibition than DNeasy. The new technique was also twice as fast and required fewer plastics and manipulations but had reduced total recovered DNA compared with DNeasy. METHOD SUMMARY DNA-XT, which is designed for small sample volumes, uses a 5-min detergent and enzymatic lysis step to release DNA from cells. Contaminating proteins and lipids are then bound to a matrix within a spin column during a 1-min centrifugation step while DNA passes directly through.","Clark, Dj; Moore, Cm; Flanagan, M; Van Bocxlaer, K; Piperaki, Et; Yardley, V; Croft, Sl; Tyson, J; Whitehouse, Sp; O'Halloran, J; Krishna, S; Staines, Hm",10.2144/btn-2019-0086,Biotechniques

Three different mulching techniques, in particular, soil coverage with grass, mulch with plastic film and with straw were investigated. The results highlighted that mulching techniques influenced the composition of the analysed EOs. All the EOs exerted good antimicrobial activity against clinical and food strains of the pathogenListeria monocytogenes,with differences related to the composition. The EO obtained from plants covered with grass showed the best results, having MIC <= 2.5 mu L/mL, and being able to inhibit also antibiotic-resistant strains, thus confirming that soil coverage with grass influences the composition and also the biological activity ofThymus vulgarisEO.","Tardugno, R; Serio, A; Purgatorio, C; Savini, V; Paparella, A; Benvenuti, S",10.1080/14786419.2020.1798666,Natural Product Research

Overview Of African Water Resources Contamination By Contaminants Of Emerging Concern,"This review look at several classes of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in conventional and non-conventional water resources across the African continent's five regions. According to the review, pharmaceuticals, endocrinedisrupting chemicals, personal care products, pesticides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds, and microplastics were found in conventional and non-conventional water resources. Most conventional water resources, such as rivers, streams, lakes, wells, and boreholes, are used as drinking water sources. Non-conventional water sources, such as treated wastewater (effluents), are used for domestic and agricultural purposes. However, CECs remain part of the treated wastewater, which is being discharged to surface water or used for agriculture. Thus, wastewater (effluent) is the main contributor to the pollution of other water resources. For African countries, the prevalence of rising emerging pollutants in water poses a severe environmental threat. There are different adverse effects of CECs, including the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ecotoxicological effects, and several endocrine disorders. Therefore, this needs the urgent attention of the African Union, policymakers, Non-Governmental Organizations, and researchers to come together and tackle the problem.","Shehu, Z; Nyakairu, Gwa; Tebandeke, E; Odume, On",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158303,Science Of The Total Environment

Bacteriophages As Therapeutic & Disinfectant Agents To Tackle Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii,"Background & objectives: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious threat for human health worldwide. The studies on agents targeting A. baumannii are imperative due to identified A. baumannii co-infections in COVID-19. Bacteriophages are promising antibacterial agents against drug-resistant bacteria. This study intended to isolate bacteriophages against MDR A. baumannii from the water of river Ganga, to be used potentially as therapeutic and disinfectant particles. Methods: Acinetobacter phages were isolated from the Ganga water collected from Kanpur and further tested on 50 MDR A. baumannii isolates to determine host range. The phages were morphologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The disinfectant property of the isolated phages was tested by spraying of bacteriophage cocktail on MDR A. baumannii contaminated plastic surface, analyzed by colony-forming unit (CFU) and bioluminescence assay (adenosine triphosphate monitoring). Results: A total of seven bacteriophages were isolated against MDR A. baumannii. The bacteriophages lysed three MDR A. baumannii isolates out of 50 tested, showing narrow host range. Electron microscopy revealed hexagonal heads and long tails of bacteriophages, belonging to order Caudovirales. The bacteriophage cocktail reduced the MDR A. baumannii load efficiently on plastic surface, evidenced by reduction in CFUs and bioluminescence. Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the isolated bacteriophages are potential lytic agents for MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates, and may be used as potential therapeutic agents as well as disinfectant to combat MDR A. baumannii with due consideration to phage host specificity, with further characterization.","Rathor, N; Bahadur, T; Thakur, Ck; Bamola, Vd; Das, Bk; Chaudhry, R",10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_355_21,Indian Journal Of Medical Research
Investigation Of Functionalized Surface Charges Of Thermoplastic Starch/Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite Films Using Polyaniline: The Potential Of Improved Antibacterial Properties,"Improving the antibacterial activity of biodegradable materials is crucial for combatting widespread drug-resistant bacteria and plastic pollutants. In this work, we studied polyaniline (PANI)-functionalized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) to improve surface charges. A PANI-functionalized ZnO NP surface was prepared using a simple impregnation technique. The PANI functionalization of ZnO successfully increased the positive surface charge of the ZnO NPs. In addition, PANI-functionalized ZnO improved mechanical properties and thermal stability. Besides those properties, the water permeability of the bionanocomposite films was decreased due to their increased hydrophobicity. PANI-functionalized ZnO NPs were applied to thermoplastic starch (TPS) films for physical properties and antibacterial studies using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The PANI-functionalized ZnO bionanocomposite films exhibited excellent antibacterial activity for both E. coli (76%) and S. aureus (72%). This result suggests that PANI-functionalized ZnO NPs can improve the antibacterial activity of TPS-based bionanocomposite films.","Charoensri, K; Rodwihok, C; Wongratanaphisan, D; Ko, Ja; Chung, Js; Park, Hj",10.3390/polym13030425,Polymers
Cutibacterium Acnes Phylogenetic Type Ic And Ii Isolated From Patients With Non-Acne Diseases Exhibit High-Level Biofilm Formation,"Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes is an important for not only exacerbating factor of acne vulgaris but also pathogen of surgical site infections (SSIs) in orthopedics and plastic surgery. Although biofilm-forming (BF) C. acnes are associated with intractable SSI, characteristics of these strains were still unknown. Here, we explored detailed molecular epidemiological features of BF C. acnes isolated as causative pathogen of infectious diseases. Phylogenetic types of 205 C. acnes strains isolated between 2013 and 2018 from 18 clinical departments of a university hospital in Japan were determined by single-locus sequence type (SLST). Clade H (traditional type IC) and K (type II) which are less relevant with healthy skin and acne vulgaris, were detected in 26.8% (55/205) and 16.1% (33/205) of the strains, respectively. The incidence of them was significantly higher than that of acne patients (H and K, each 2.9%, P < 0.05). In addition, SLST distribution of C. acnes strains differed by each department and isolation site. When biofilm formation was quantified, 51 strains (24.9%) were defined as highBF strains. Notably, most high-BF strains were classified into the strains of clade H (56.4%, 31/55) and clade K (54.4%, 18/33), and these strains were frequently found in the strains isolated from patients of medical emergency center and plastic surgery. Similarly, high-BF strains were frequently found among the isolates from blood (35.7%) and catheters (30.0%), with a high proportion belonging to clades H and K. Compared to C. acnes strains isolated from acne patients, antimicrobial-resistant strains were less identified in non-acne patients. Our findings showed that pathogenicity of C. acnes strains differs by their phylogenetic types. Furthermore, we showed clade H and K have the ability of high biofilm formation and suggest that these strains have potential to become a risk factor for SSI.","Nakase, K; Koizumi, J; Midorikawa, R; Yamasaki, K; Tsutsui, M; Aoki, S; Nasu, Y; Hirai, Y; Nakaminami, H; Noguchi, N",10.1016/j.ijmm.2021.151538,International Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Hgf/C-Met Signalling In The Tumor Microenvironment,"Recently, it has become clearer that tumor plasticity increases the chance that cancer cells could acquire new mechanisms to escape immune surveillance, become resistant to conventional drugs, and spread to distant sites. Effectively, tumor plasticity drives adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation leading to stimulation of neoangionesis or tumor escape. Therefore, tumor plasticity is believed to be a great contributor in recurrence and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Importantly, it could be an Achilles' heel of cancer if we could identify molecular mechanisms dictating this phenotype. The reactivation of stem-like signalling pathways is considered a great determinant of tumor plasticity; in addition, a key role has been also attributed to tumor microenvironment (TME). Indeed, it has been proved that cancer cells interact with different cells in the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, well-established communication represents a potential allied in maintenance of a plastic phenotype in cancer cells supporting tumor growth and spread. An important signalling pathway mediating cancer cell-TME crosstalk is represented by the HGF/c-Met signalling. Here, we review the role of the HGF/c-Met signalling in tumor-stroma crosstalk focusing on novel findings underlying its role in tumor plasticity, immune escape, and development of adaptive mechanisms.","Zambelli, A; Biamonti, G; Amato, A",10.1007/978-3-030-47189-7_2,"Tumor Microenvironment: Signaling Pathways, Pt B"
Modeling The Effect Of Acquired Resistance On Cancer Therapy Outcomes,"Adaptive therapy (AT) is an evolution-based treatment strategy that exploits cell-cell competition. Acquired resistance can change the competitive nature of cancer cells in a tumor, impacting AT outcomes. We aimed to determine if adaptive therapy can still be effective with cell's acquiring resistance. We developed an agent-based model for spatial tumor growth considering three different types of acquired resistance: random genetic mutations during cell division, drug-induced reversible (plastic) phenotypic changes, and drug-induced irreversible phenotypic changes. These three resistance mechanisms lead to different spatial distributions of resistant cells. To quantify the spatial distribution, we propose an extension of Ripley's K-function, Sampled Ripley's K-function (SRKF), which calculates the non-randomness of the resistance distribution over the tumor domain. Our model predicts that the emergent spatial distribution of resistance can determine the time to progression under both adaptive and continuous therapy (CT). Notably, a high rate of random genetic mutations leads to quicker progression under AT than CT due to the emergence of many small clumps of resistant cells. Drug-induced phenotypic changes accelerate tumor progression irrespective of the treatment strategy. Low-rate switching to a sensitive state reduces the benefits of AT compared to CT. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that drug-induced resistance necessitates aggressive treatment under CT, regardless of the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, there is an optimal dose that can most effectively delay tumor relapse under AT by suppressing resistance. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that diverse resistance mechanisms can shape the distribution of resistance and thus determine the efficacy of adaptive therapy.","Masud, Ma; Kim, Jy; Kim, E",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107035,Computers In Biology And Medicine
"Direct, Rapid Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test From Positive Blood Cultures Based On Microscopic Imaging Analysis","For the timely treatment of patients with infections in bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid, a rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) is urgently needed. Here, we describe a direct and rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (dRAST) system, which can determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria from a positive blood culture bottle (PBCB) in six hours. The positive blood culture sample is directly mixed with agarose and inoculated into a micropatterned plastic microchip with lyophilized antibiotic agents. Using microscopic detection of bacterial colony formation in agarose, the total time to result from a PBCB for dRAST was only six hours for a wide range of bacterial concentrations in PBCBs. The results from the dRAST system were consistent with the results from a standard AST, broth microdilution test. In tests of clinical isolates (n = 206) composed of 16 Gram-negative species and seven Gram-positive species, the dRAST system was accurate compared to the standard broth microdilution test, with rates of 91.11% (2613/2868) categorical agreement, 6.69% (192/2868) minor error, 2.72% (50/1837) major error and 1.45% (13/896) very major error. Thus, the dRAST system can be used to rapidly identify appropriate antimicrobial agents for the treatment of blood stream infection (BSI) and antibiotic-resistant strain infections.","Choi, J; Jeong, Hy; Lee, Gy; Han, S; Han, S; Jin, B; Lim, T; Kim, S; Kim, Dy; Kim, Hc; Kim, Ec; Song, Sh; Kim, Ts; Kwon, S",10.1038/s41598-017-01278-2,Scientific Reports
Clinical And Pathological Analyses Of Chronic Vascular Rejection After Kidney Transplantation,"AimWe discuss the clinicopathological analysis of cases of chronic vascular rejection (CVR) cases after renal transplantation and clarify the mechanisms underlying the development and prognostic significance of CVR. PatientsCVR was diagnosed in 46 renal allograft biopsy specimens (BS) obtained from 34 renal transplant patients being followed up at the Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, between January 2009 and December 2013. ResultsCVR was diagnosed at a median of 47.4 months post-transplant. Among the 36 patients, 23 had a history of acute rejection. Among the 46 BS showing evidence of CVR, the CVR was mild (cv1 in Banff's classification) in 23, moderate (cv2) in 17, and severe (cv3) in 6. Of the 40 samples obtained at the time of the biopsy and assayed with plastic beads coated with HLA antigen, 31 (78%) showed circulating ant-HLA alloantibody, and 15 (38%) showed donor-specific antibodies. We then classified the 46 BS showing evidence of CVR by their overall histopathological features, as follows; cv alone was seen in 16 (35%) BS, cv+antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in 26 (56%), and cv+T-cell-mediated rejection in 9 (19%). Loss of the renal allograft occurred during the observation period in nine of the patients (26%). Of the remaining patients with functioning grafts, deterioration of the renal allograft function after the biopsies occurred in 11 patients (32%). ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that AMR may underlie CVR in many cases, while T cell-mediated rejection may play an important role in some cases.","Shimizu, T; Toma, H; Shibahara, R; Tsunoyama, K; Izuka, J; Nozaki, T; Ishida, H; Tanabe, K; Honda, K; Koike, J",10.1111/nep.12464,Nephrology
New Opportunities And Challenges To Defeat Cancer Stem Cells,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that are capable of self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, plastic adaptation, and immune regulation, thereby mediating tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. CSCs are associated with cancer progression and clinical outcome in cancer patients. Successful targeting of CSCs will therefore be necessary to eradicate and cure cancer. Functional regulators of stem cell (stemness) signaling pathways in human cancers have brought new opportunities to target CSCs and reframe cancer-targeting strategies in clinical settings. However, challenges remain due to a lack of complete understanding of CSC plasticity/heterogeneity and the limited efficacy of individual stemness inhibitors in cancer treatment. In this article we review CSC signaling pathways and the current state of CSC-targeting therapeutics in combinatory treatments in clinical trials.","Ramos, Ek; Hoffmann, Ad; Gerson, Sl; Liu, Hp",10.1016/j.trecan.2017.08.007,Trends In Cancer
Flexible Hierarchical Wraps Repel Drug-Resistant Gram-Negative And Positive Bacteria,"Healthcare acquired infections are a major human health problem, and are becoming increasingly troublesome with the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. Engineered surfaces that reduce the adhesion, proliferation, and spread of bacteria have promise as a mean of preventing infections and reducing the use of antibiotics. To address this need, we created a flexible plastic wrap that combines a hierarchical wrinkled structure with chemical functionalization to reduce bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and the transfer of bacteria through an intermediate surface. These hierarchical wraps were effective for reducing biofilm formation of World Health Organization-designated priority pathogens Gram positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 87 and 84%, respectively. In addition, these surfaces remain free of bacteria after being touched by a contaminated surface with Gram negative E. coli. We showed that these properties are the result of broad liquid repellency of the engineered surfaces and the presence of reduced anchor points for bacterial adhesion on the hierarchical structure. Such wraps are fabricated using scalable bottom-up techniques and form an effective cover on a variety of complex objects, making them superior to top-down and substrate-specific surface modification methods.","Imani, Sm; Maclachlan, R; Rachwalski, K; Chan, Yt; Lee, B; Mcinnes, M; Grandfield, K; Brown, Ed; Didar, Tf; Soleymani, L",10.1021/acsnano.9b06287,Acs Nano
The Impact Of Di(2-Ethylhexyl)Phthalate On Cancer Progression,"Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, mainly serves as an additive to render polyvinyl chloride (PVC) soft and flexible. PVC plastics have become ubiquitous in our modern society. Yet, the leaching of DEHP from PVC-based consumables ultimately results in the deposition in certain tissues via inadvertent applications. Health risks for human populations exposed to DEHP has been assumed by studies on rodents and other species, including the DEHP-induced developmental dysregulation, reproductive impairments, tumorigenesis, and diseases in a transgenerational manner. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the accumulated literature regarding the multifaceted roles of DEHP in the activation of the nuclear receptors, the alteration of the redox homeostasis, epigenetic modifications and the acquisition of chemoresistance.","Chou, Ck; Yang, Yt; Yang, Hc; Liang, Ss; Wang, Tn; Kuo, Pl; Wang, Hmd; Tsai, Em; Chiu, Cc",10.1007/s00005-017-0494-2,Archivum Immunologiae Et Therapiae Experimentalis
Comparing The Antimicrobial Effect Of Silver Ion-Coated Silicone And Gentamicin-Irrigated Silicone Sheets From Breast Implant Material,"Background Post-operative infection is a significant complication of breast implant surgery that may require extensive use of antibiotics and surgical interventions. Here, we developed a biomaterial coating that is chemically bonded to silicone implants which delivers antimicrobial ions over time. Methods After coating the silicone implants with a mediator polymer (gamma-PGA), the implants were impregnated with silver (Ag) ions. Antimicrobial effects of these implants were assayed with modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The silicone disks were transferred to a plate with fresh bacteria. Control was intended to simulate an intra-operative wash. Results The Ag-gamma-PGA coated silicone demonstrated antimicrobial effects against the most common etiological agents of breast implant infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no effect of inhibition of bacterial growth around the control silicone or the silicone coated only with gamma-PGA. The zone of inhibition was generally larger around the Ag-gamma-PGA coated silicone as compared to the silicone irrigated with gentamicin, and continued antibacterial effect was also observed at 48 hours in the Ag-gamma-PGA coated silicone for all bacteria groups with the exception of P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin-irrigated silicone did not inhibit bacterial growth at 48 hours. Conclusion The observed antibacterial performance of the Ag-gamma-PGA coating as compared to simulated intra-operative antibiotic wash is promising and should be further evaluated to develop the next generation of implants with diminished risk for post-operative implant infections.","Heno, F; Azoulay, Z; Khalfin, B; Craddock, Ha; Silberstein, E; Moran-Gilad, J; Rapaport, H",10.1007/s00266-021-02348-7,Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
"Recent Advances In Biomedical, Therapeutic And Pharmaceutical Applications Of Microbial Surfactants","The spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens typically existing in biofilm formation and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, although unrelated phenomena, have demonstrated the urgent need for methods to combat such increasing threats. New avenues of research for natural molecules with desirable properties to alleviate this situation have, therefore, been expanding. Biosurfactants comprise a group of unique and varied amphiphilic molecules of microbial origin capable of interacting with lipidic membranes/components of microorganisms and altering their physicochemical properties. These features have encouraged closer investigations of these microbial metabolites as new pharmaceutics with potential applications in clinical, hygiene and therapeutic fields. Mounting evidence has indicated that biosurfactants have antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities that are exploitable in new anticancer treatments and wound healing applications. Some biosurfactants have already been approved for use in clinical, food and environmental fields, while others are currently under investigation and development as antimicrobials or adjuvants to antibiotics for microbial suppression and biofilm eradication strategies. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, biosurfactants are now being explored as an alternative to current products or procedures for effective cleaning and handwash formulations, antiviral plastic and fabric surface coating agents for shields and masks. In addition, biosurfactants have shown promise as drug delivery systems and in the medicinal relief of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Ceresa, C; Fracchia, L; Fedeli, E; Porta, C; Banat, Im",10.3390/pharmaceutics13040466,Pharmaceutics
Structural Requirement Of Ha5G18 Peptide (Ddfvfyvggyps) From Laminin Α5 Chain For Amyloid-Like Fibril Formation And Cell Adhesion,"The hA5G18 peptide (DDFVFYVGGYPS) identified from the human laminin alpha 5 chain G domain promotes cell attachment and spreading when directly coated on a plastic plate, but does not show activity when it is conjugated on a chitosan matrix. Here, we focused on the structural requirement of hA5G18 for activity. hA5G18 was stained with Congo red and formed amyloid-like fibrils. A deletion analysis of hA5G18 revealed that FVFYV was a minimum active sequence for the formation of amyloid-like fibrils, but FVFYV did not promote cell attachment. Next, we designed functional fibrils using FVFYV as a template for amyloid-like fibrils. When we conjugated an integrin binding sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to the FVFYV peptide with Gly-Gly (GG) as a spacer, FVFYVGGRGD promoted cell attachment in a plate coat assay, but a negative control sequence RGE conjugated peptide, FVFYVGGRGE, also showed activity. However, when the peptides were conjugated to Sepharose beads, the FVFYVGGRGD beads showed cell attachment activity, but the FVFYVGGRGE beads did not. These results suggest that RGD and RGE similarly contribute to cell attachment activity in amyloid-like fibrils, but only RGD contributes the activity on the Sepharose beads. Further, we conjugated a basic amino acid (Arg, Lys, and His) to the FVFYV peptide. Arg or Lys-conjugated FVFYV peptides, FVFYVGGR and FVFYVGGK, showed cell attachment activity when they were coated on a plate, but a His-conjugated FVFYV peptide FVFYVGGH did not show activity. None of the basic amino acid-conjugated peptides showed cell attachment in a Sepharose bead assay. The cell attachment and spreading on FVFYVGGR and FVFYVGGK were inhibited by an anti-integrin beta 1 antibody. These results suggest that the Arg and Lys residues play critical roles in the interaction with integrins in amyloid-like fibrils. FVFYV is useful to use as a template for amyloid-like fibrils and to develop multi-functional biomaterials.","Zhang, Gr; Yamada, Y; Kumai, J; Hamada, K; Kikkawa, Y; Nomizu, M",10.3390/molecules27196610,Molecules
A Bioreactor System For The Manufacture Of A Genetically Modified Plasmodium Falciparum Blood Stage Malaria Cell Bank For Use In A Clinical Trial,"Background: Although the use of induced blood stage malaria infection has proven to be a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against Plasmodium falciparum, a limiting factor has been the availability of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant defined P. falciparum strains for in vivo use. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effective method for the large-scale production of P. falciparum cell banks suitable for use in clinical trials. Methods: Genetically-attenuated parasites (GAP) were produced by targeted deletion of the gene encoding the knob associated histidine rich protein (kahrp) from P. falciparum strain 3D7. A GAP master cell bank (MCB) was manufactured by culturing parasites in an FDA approved single use, closed system sterile plastic bioreactor. All components used to manufacture the MCB were screened to comply with standards appropriate for in vivo use. The cryopreserved MCB was subjected to extensive testing to ensure GMP compliance for a phase 1 investigational product. Results: Two hundred vials of the GAP MCB were successfully manufactured. At harvest, the GAP MCB had a parasitaemia of 6.3%, with 96% of parasites at ring stage. Testing confirmed that all release criteria were met (sterility, absence of viral contaminants and endotoxins, parasite viability following cryopreservation, identity and anti-malarial drug sensitivity of parasites). Conclusion: Large-scale in vitro culture of P. falciparum parasites using a wave bioreactor can be achieved under GMP-compliant conditions. This provides a cost-effective methodology for the production of malaria parasites suitable for administration in clinical trials.","Pawliw, R; Farrow, R; Sekuloski, S; Jennings, H; Healer, J; Phuong, T; Sathe, P; Pasay, C; Evans, K; Cowman, Af; Schofield, L; Chen, Nh; Mccarthy, J; Trenholme, K",10.1186/s12936-018-2435-x,Malaria Journal
Characterizing Infections In Prosthetic Breast Reconstruction: A Validity Assessment Of National Health Databases,"Introduction: Current guidelines in the United States require reporting only the 30-day postoperative outcomes to standardized databases, including the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Thus, many breast implant-related complications go unreported in standard databases. We sought to characterize late periprosthetic infections following implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all women who underwent expander/implant reconstruction from 2005 to 2014 at two institutions. All periprosthetic infections were identified and divided into early and late cohorts (<= 30 days or > 30 days). Infection was defined as any episode where antibiotics were initiated or a prosthetic device was explanted because of clinical evidence of the infection. Results: In the 1820 patients (2980 breasts) identified, 421 periprosthetic infections occurred (14%). Of these, 173 (41%) were early and 248 (59%) were late (mean time to infection = 66.4 +/- 101.9 days). Patients with late infections were more likely to be current smokers or have diabetes than patients with early infections (p < 0.034 for both). Infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and antimicrobial-resistant strains of Staphylococcus were more common in the early infection group (p < 0.001 for both). Implant loss due to infection was more common in the late infection group (p = 0.037). Discussion: Late periprosthetic infections following implant-based breast reconstruction are underestimated in national outcome databases and have unique risk factors and microbiology compared to early infections. A system-level change in reevaluating and redefining a timeline for tracking and treating implant infections is necessary, given the substantial morbidity associated with, and frequency of, late periprosthetic infections.

Combined Effects Of Polyvinyl Chloride Or Polypropylene Microplastics With Cadmium On The Intestine Of Zebrafish At Environmentally Relevant Concentrations,"Cadmium (Cd) is a common additive in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) plastics. Aquatic organisms were inevitably co-exposed to PVC/PP microplastics (MPs) and Cd, but their combined toxicity is still unknown. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to 200 mu g/L MPs (PVC or PP) and 10 mu g/L Cd alone or in combination for 28 days to investigate their toxicity and mechanisms. Results showed that combined exposure with PVC/PP enhanced the Cd accumulation in the zebrafish intestine. Subsequently, toxicology analyses showed that both PVC and PP possessed synergistic toxicity with Cd, manifested by the exfoliation and necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, and increased levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). PP exhibited a stronger synergistic effect than PVC. Integration of non-targeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that combined exposure to PVC and Cd induced intestine toxicity mainly through bile acid (BA) biosynthesis, fructose (Fru) and mannose (Man) metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The combined exposure of PP and Cd induced toxicity through the arginine (Arg) and glutathione (GSH) metabolisms. Meanwhile, combined exposure of PVC/PP and Cd increased the abundance of intestinal Proteobacteria and pathogen Vibrio, and decreased the abundance of Gemmobacter. These changes indrectly promoted the synergistic toxicity of PVC/PP and Cd through metabolites, such as indole-3-pyruvate (IPyA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and cholic acid (CA). These findings highlighted that more attention should be paid to the toxicity of chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations, particularly those co-existing with MPs.","Li, H; Yang, Zc; Liu, Yx; Sun, Pp; Wu, B; Chen, L",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176289,Science Of The Total Environment
Characterization Of Mannheimia Haemolytica Biofilm Formation In Vitro,"Mannheimia haemolytica is the primary bacterial agent in the bovine respiratory disease complex. It is thought that M. haemolytica colonizes the tonsillar crypts of cattle as a commensal and subsequently descends into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacterial species persist in the host as biofilms. There is limited information about the ability of M. haemolytica to form biofilms. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model for M. haemolytica biofilm formation. We found that M. haemolytica required at least 36 h to form robust biofilms on plastic in vitro when incubated in RPMI-1640 tissue culture medium at 37 C, with maximal biofilm formation being evident at 48 h. Biofilm formation was inhibited by adding the monosacchari des D(+) galactose and D(+) mannose to the growth medium. Addition of antibodies to the M. haemolytica surface protein OmpA also reduced biofilm formation. Upon evaluating the macromolecules within the biofilm extracellular polymeric substance we found it contained 9.7 mu g/cm(2) of protein, 0.81 mu g/cm(2) of total carbohydrate, and 0.47 mu g/cm(2) of extracellular DNA. Furthermore, proteinase K treatment significantly decreased biofilms (P < 0.05) while mu-amylase and micrococcal nuclease decreased biofilms to a lesser extent. M. haemolytica biofilm cells were more resistant than planktonic cells to the antibiotics florfenicol, gentamicin, and tulathromycin. These results provide evidence that M. haemolytica can form biofilms, which could contribute to its ability to persist as a commensal in the bovine upper respiratory tract. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nanoemulsion-Loaded Hydrogel Coatings For Inhibition Of Bacterial Virulence And Biofilm Formation On Solid Surfaces,"The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century for the researchers to combat and in turn search for novel targets which could lead to the development of effective and sustainable therapies. Inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence of bacterial pathogens is an emerging approach to address the challenges related to bacterial infections. To suppress the virulence and biofilm formation by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECOH), we developed stable nanoemulsion (NE) of Gaultheria fragrantissima Wall. essential oil's (EO) bioactive compounds, viz., eugenol (E-NE) and methyl salicylate (MS-NE) that showed significantly higher anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate without affecting ECOH planktonic cell growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that E-NE and MS-NE reduced the expression of genes, including curli, type I fimbriae, Shiga-like toxins, quorum sensing, and ler-controlled toxins, which are needed for biofilm formation, pathogenicity, and attachment. E-NE and MS-NE loaded hydrogel coatings showed superior anti-biofilm activity against ECOH on glass, plastic and meat surfaces as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate loaded coatings. Conclusively, NE-loaded hydrogel coatings could be used in combating ECOH infection on solid surfaces through anti-biofilm and anti-virulence strategies.","Prateeksha; Barik, Sk; Singh, Bn",10.1038/s41598-019-43016-w,Scientific Reports
Low-Velocity Impact Experiments And Modeling Of Trc Skin-Aerated Concrete Core Sandwich Composites,"Mechanical response of textile-reinforced aerated concrete sandwich panels was investigated using instrumented three-point bending tests under quasi-static and low-velocity impact loads. Two types of core material were compared in the sandwich composite consisting of plain autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and fiber-reinforced aerated concrete (FRAC), and the stress skins were alkali-resistant glass (ARG) and textile reinforced concrete (TRC). The textile-reinforced layer promoted distributed cracking mechanisms and resulted in significant improvement in the flexural strength and ductility. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to study the distributed cracking mechanism and obtain impact force-crack width response at different drop heights. A constitutive material model was also developed based on a multi-linear tension/compression strain hardening model for the stress-skin and an elastic, perfectly plastic compression model for the core. A detailed parametric study was used to address the effect of model parameters on the flexural response. The model was further applied to simulate the experimental flexural data from the static and impact tests on the plain aerated concrete and sandwich composite beams.","Pleesudjai, C; Li, Al; Dey, V; Mobasher, B",10.3390/ma14020390,Materials
The Biology And Function Of Fibroblasts In Cancer,"Among all cells, fibroblasts could be considered the cockroaches of the human body. They survive severe stress that is usually lethal to all other cells, and they are the only normal cell type that can be live-cultured from post-mortem and decaying tissue. Their resilient adaptation may reside in their intrinsic survival programmes and cellular plasticity. Cancer is associated with fibroblasts at all stages of disease progression, including metastasis, and they are a considerable component of the general host response to tissue damage caused by cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) become synthetic machines that produce many different tumour components. CAFs have a role in creating extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and metabolic and immune reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment with an impact on adaptive resistance to chemotherapy. The pleiotropic actions of CAFs on tumour cells are probably reflective of them being a heterogeneous and plastic population with context-dependent influence on cancer.","Kalluri, R",10.1038/nrc.2016.73,Nature Reviews Cancer
Host Defense Against Klebsiella Pneumoniae Pneumonia Is Augmented By Lung-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of Gram-negative pneumonia. The spread of antibiotic-resistant and hypervirulent strains has made treatment more challenging. This study sought to determine the immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and therapeutic potential of purified murine stem cell Ag-1(+) (Sca-1(+)) lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs) using in vitro cell culture and an in vivo mouse model of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae. Sca-1(+) LMSCs are plastic adherent, possess colony-forming capacity, express mesenchymal stem cell markers, differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro, and exhibit a high proliferative capacity. Further, these Sca-1(+) LMSCs are morphologically similar to fibroblasts but differ ultrastructurally. Moreover, Sca-1(+) LMSCs have the capacity to inhibit LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines by bone marrow-derived macrophages and neutrophils in vitro. Sca-1(+) LMSCs inhibit the growth of K. pneumoniae more potently than do neutrophils. Sca-1(+) LMSCs also possess the intrinsic ability to phagocytize and kill K pneumoniae intracellularly. Whereas the induction of autophagy promotes bacterial replication, inhibition of autophagy enhances the intracellular clearance of K pneumoniae in Sca-1(+) LMSCs during the early time of infection. Adoptive transfer of Sca-1(+) LMSCs in K. pneumoniae-infected mice improved survival, reduced inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and pathological lesions in the lung, and enhanced bacterial clearance in the lung and in extrapulmonary organs. To our knowledge, these results together illustrate for the first time the protective role of LMSCs in bacterial pneumonia.","Rangasamy, T; Ghimire, L; Jin, Ll; Le, J; Periasamy, S; Paudel, S; Cai, Ss; Jeyaseelan, S",10.4049/jimmunol.2000688,Journal Of Immunology
Leech Management Before Application On Patient: A Nationwide Survey Of Practices In French University Hospitals,"Background: Leech therapy in plastic/reconstructive microsurgery significantly improves a successful outcome of flap salvage but the drawback is a risk of severe infection that results in a drop of the salvage rates from 70-80% to below 30%. We report the results of a national survey conducted in all the French university hospitals to assess the current extent of use of leech for medical practices in the hospital and to investigate maintenance, delivery practices and prevention of the risk of infection. Methods: Data concerning conditions of storage, leech external decontamination, microbiological controls, mode of delivery and antibiotic prophylaxis were collected from all the French university hospitals in practicing leech therapy, on the basis of a standardized questionnaire. Results: Twenty-eight of the 32 centers contacted filled the questionnaire, among which 23 practiced leech therapy, mostly with a centralized storage in the pharmacy; 39.1% of the centers declared to perform leech external decontamination and only 2 centers recurrent microbiological controls of the water storage. Leech delivery was mostly nominally performed (56.5%), but traceability of the leech batch number was achieved in only 39.1% of the cases. Only 5 centers declared that a protocol of antibiotic prophylaxis was systematically administered during leech therapy: either quinolone (2), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (2) or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1). Conclusions: Measures to prevent infectious complications before application to patient have to be better applied and guidelines of good practices are necessary.","Grau, D; Masson, R; Villiet, M; Lamy, B",10.1186/s13756-018-0311-7,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Protective Efficacy Of Phage Pvn02 Against Haemorrhagic Septicaemia In Striped Catfish Pangasianodon Hypophthalmus Via Oral Administration,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Aeromonas hydrophila in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is one of the most important aquatic diseases in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. However, antibiotic-resistant A. hydrophila strains have become popular and resulted in inadequate control of the disease in striped catfish farms. This study investigates the protective efficacy of bacteriophage PVN02 against haemorrhagic septicaemia in striped catfish via oral administration. The phage-containing pellets were prepared by spraying the phage solution on food pellets at 20 ml/kg. The rate of phage desorption from the food pellets into the water was very low; the phage titres in the water were approximately log 1.0 PFU/ml or undetectable. The in vivo experiment evaluating the protective efficacy of PVN02 against haemorrhagic septicaemia in striped catfish was conducted using 21 groups of 1,260 fish in 50-L plastic tanks in triplicate. The catfish were fed twice daily with phage-sprayed pellets. Different densities of bacterial suspensions were added into the tanks for 24 hr. Without the existence of the phage, the highest mortality rate was 68.3 +/- 2.9% at the highest density of bacterial suspension. In contrast, the mortality rate at the highest density of bacterial suspension was significantly reduced to 8.33 +/- 2.9% or 16.67 +/- 2.9% at the phage dose of log 6.2 +/- 0.09 or log 4.2 +/- 0.09 PFU/g. This study provides a very practical manner of applying phage therapy to prevent disease in large-scale striped catfish farms.","Dang, Tho; Xuan, Ttt; Duyen, L; Le, Np; Hoang, Ha",10.1111/jfd.13387,Journal Of Fish Diseases
Eradication Of Acinetobacter Baumannii/Enterobacter Cloacae Complex In An Open Proximal Tibial Fracture And Closed Drop Foot Correction With A Multidisciplinary Approach Using The Taylor Spatial Frame®: A Case Report,"BackgroundMulti-drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum betalactamase or carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae) are emerging in early-onset infections. So far, there is no report describing the eradication of these bacteria in a osseous infection of an open proximal tibial fracture in combination with the hexapod technology to address both osseous consolidation and closed drop foot correction.Case presentationAfter sustaining a proximal tibial fracture (Gustilo 3B), a 41-year-old man was primarily treated with open reduction and internal fixation by a locking plate and split-thickness skin graft in the home country. At the time of admission to our hospital there was a significant anterolateral soft tissue defect covered with an already-necrotic split-thickness graft and suspicious secretion. CAT and MRI scans revealed no signs of osseous healing, intramedullary distinctive osteomyelitis, as well as a large abscess zone in the dorsal compartment. Multiple wound smears showed multi-drug-resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem resistant) as well as Enterobacter cloacae complex (AmpC overexpression). After implant removal, excessive osseous and intramedullary debridements using the Reamer Irrigator Aspirator (RIA((R))) as well as initial negative pressure wound therapy were performed. Colistin hand-modelled chains and sticks were applied topically as well as an adjusted systemic antibiotic scheme was applied. After repetitive surgical interventions, the smears showed bacterial eradication and the patient underwent soft tissue reconstruction with a free vascularized latissimus dorsi muscle flap. External fixation was converted to a hexapod fixator (TSF (R)) to correct primary varus displacement, axial assignment and secure osseous healing. A second ring was mounted to address the fixed drop foot in a closed fashion without further intervention. At final follow-up, 12months after trauma, the patient showed good functional recovery with osseous healing, intact soft tissue with satisfactory cosmetics and no signs of reinfection.ConclusionsA multidisciplinary approach with orthopaedic surgeons for debridement, planning and establishing osseous and joint correction and consolidation, plastic surgeons for microvascular muscle flaps for soft tissue defect coverage as well as clinical microbiologists for the optimized anti-infective treatment is essential in these challenging rare cases.Level of evidenceLevel IV.","Siebenbürger, G; Grabein, B; Schenck, T; Kammerlander, C; Böcker, W; Zeckey, C",10.1186/s40001-019-0360-2,European Journal Of Medical Research
Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecule-2 (Corm-2) Inhibits Growth Of Multidrug-Resistant Uropathogenic Escherichia Coli In Biofilm And Following Host Cell Colonization,"Background: Increased resistance to antimicrobial agents is a characteristic of many bacteria growing in biofilms on for example indwelling urinary catheters or in intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Biofilm-related infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are a major challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate if a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-2) has antibacterial effects against ESBL-producing uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in the biofilm mode of growth and following colonization of host bladder epithelial cells. Results: The effect of CORM-2 was examined on bacteria grown within an established biofilm (biofilm formed for 24 h on plastic surface) by a live/dead viability staining assay. CORM-2 (500 mu M) exposure for 24 h killed approximately 60 % of the ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. A non-ESBL-producing UPEC isolate and the E. coli K-12 strain TG1 were also sensitive to CORM-2 exposure when grown in biofilms. The antibacterial effect of CORM-2 on planktonic bacteria was reduced and delayed in the stationary growth phase compared to the exponential growth phase. In human bladder epithelial cell colonization experiments, CORM-2 exposure for 4 h significantly reduced the bacterial counts of an ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. Conclusion: This study shows that CORM-2 has antibacterial properties against multidrug-resistant UPEC under biofilm-like conditions and following host cell colonization, which motivate further studies of its therapeutic potential.","Bang, Cs; Kruse, R; Johansson, K; Persson, K",10.1186/s12866-016-0678-7,Bmc Microbiology
Garlic Stalk Waste And Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Mitigate Challenges In Continuously Monocropping Eggplant Obstacles By Modulating Physiochemical Properties And Fungal Community Structure,"Background and aimsContinuous vegetable production under plastic tunnels faces challenges like soil degradation, increased soil-borne pathogens, and diminished eggplant yield. These factors collectively threaten the long-term sustainability of food security by diminishing the productivity and resilience of agricultural soils. This research examined the use of raw garlic stalk (RGS) waste and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a sustainable solution for these issues in eggplant monoculture. We hypothesized that the combined application of RGS waste and AMF would improve soil physicochemical properties compared to untreated soil in eggplant monoculture. The combined use of RGS and AMF was expected to suppress soil-borne pathogens, increase the abundance of soil beneficial microorganisms and alter fungal community structure. The combined application of RGS and AMF will significantly enhance eggplant yield compared to untreated plots. This study aimed to determine whether AMF and RGS, individually or in combination, can ameliorate the adverse effects of monoculture on eggplant soil. We also investigated whether these treatments could enhance eggplant yield.MethodsThe experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with four treatments: AMF, RGS, and a combined treatment of AMF + RGS (ARGS), along with a control. Each treatment was replicated three times, Eggplant seedlings inoculated with AMF and treated with RGS amendments, both individually and combined. The effects on root traits, soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activity, and fungal community structure were investigated.ResultsRGS amendments and AMF inoculation improved root length, volume, and mycorrhizal colonization. The combined treatment showed the most significant improvement. RGS and AMF application increased soil nutrient availability (N, P, K) and organic matter content. Enzyme activities also increased with RGS and AMF treatments, with the combined application showing the highest activity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) increased, while soil pH decreased with RGS and AMF amendments. Sequencing revealed a shift in the fungal community structure. Ascomycota abundance decreased, while Basidiomycota abundance increased with RGS and AMF application. The combined treatment reduced the abundance of pathogenic genera (Fusarium) and enriched beneficial taxa (Chaetomium, Coprinellus, Aspergillus). Pearson correlations supported the hypothesis that soil physicochemical properties influence fungal community composition.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of co-applying RGS and AMF in continuous cropping systems. It enhances soil physicochemical properties, reduces soil-borne pathogens, and promotes beneficial microbial communities and eggplant yield. This combined approach offers a sustainable strategy to address the challenges associated with eggplant monoculture under plastic tunnels.","Cao, Yh; Ghani, Mi; Ahmad, N; Bibi, N; Ghafoor, A; Liu, J; Gou, Jy; Zou, X",10.1186/s12870-024-05710-4,Bmc Plant Biology
A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial To Assess Antibiotic Pocket Irrigation On Tissue Expander Breast Reconstruction,"Bacterial infection is the most common complication following staged post-mastectomy breast reconstruction initiated with a tissue expander (TE). To limit bacterial infection, antibiotic irrigation of the surgical site is commonly performed despite little high-quality data to support this practice. We performed a prospective randomized control trial to compare the impact of saline irrigation alone to a triple antibiotic irrigation regimen (1 g cefazolin, 80 mg gentamicin, and 50,000 units of bacitracin in 500 mL of saline) for breast implant surgery. The microbiome in breasts with cancer (n = 16) was compared to those without (n = 16), as all patients (n = 16) had unilateral cancers but bilateral mastectomies (n = 32). Biologic and prosthetic specimens procured both at the time of mastectomy and during TE removal months later were analyzed for longitudinal comparison. Outcomes included clinical infection, bacterial abundance, and relative microbiome composition. No patient in either group suffered a reconstructive failure or developed an infection. Triple antibiotic irrigation administered at the time of immediate TE reconstruction did not reduce bacterial abundance or impact microbial diversity relative to saline irrigation at the time of planned exchange. Implanted prosthetic material adopted the microbial composition of the surrounding host tissue. In cancer-naive breasts, relative to saline, antibiotic irrigation increased bacterial abundance on periprosthetic capsules (P = 0.03) and acellular dermal matrices (P = 0.04) and altered the microbiota on both. These data show that, relative to saline only, the use of triple antibiotic irrigation in TE breast reconstruction does impact the bacterial abundance and diversity of certain biomaterials from cancer-naive breasts. IMPORTANCE The lifetime risk of breast cancer is similar to 13% in women and is treated with The lifetime risk of breast cancer is similar to 13% in women and is treated with a mastectomy in similar to 50% of cases.The majority are reconstructed,usually starting with a mastectomy in similar to 50% of cases. The majority are reconstructed, usually starting with a tissue expander to help restore the volume for a subsequent permanent breast implant or the women's own tissues. The biopsychosocial benefits of breast reconstruction, though, can be tempered by a high complication rate of at least 7% but over 30% in some women. Bacterial infection is the most common complication, and can lead to treatment delays, patient physical and emotional distress and escalating health care cost. To limit this risk, plastic surgeons have tried a variety of strategies to limit bacterial infection including irrigating the pocket created after removing the breast implant with antibiotic solutions, but good-quality data are scarce. Herein, we study the value of antibiotics in pocket irrigation using a robust randomized clinical trial design and molecular microbiology approaches.","Walker, Jn; Hanson, Bm; Hunter, T; Simar, Sr; Duran Ramirez, Jm; Obernuefemann, Clp; Parikh, Rp; Tenenbaum, Mm; Margenthaler, Ja; Hultgren, Sj; Myckatyn, Tm",10.1128/spectrum.01430-23,Microbiology Spectrum
Ceftriaxone-Resistant Aeromonas Hydrophila Infection Following Leech Therapy: A New Resistant Strain,"We report a case of ceftriaxone-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila infection in a 32-year-old man after medicinal leech therapy. The patient underwent a free gracilis muscle flap for dorsal foot soft tissue reconstruction. Because of persistent congestion after venous revision, medicinal leech therapy was initiated to aid in flap salvage. Intravenous ceftriaxone was administered prior to application of leeches for prophylaxis against A. hydrophila. Leech therapy was discontinued after 1 week, and ceftriaxone was discontinued 24 hours thereafter. An infection developed despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Culture sensitivities indicated that A. hydrophila was resistant to ceftriaxone.","Bykowski, Mr; Zhu, X; Diaz-Garcia, R",10.1097/SAP.0000000000001540,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Testing Cathelicidin Susceptibility Of Bacterial Mastitis Isolates: Technical Challenges And Data Output For Clinical Isolates,"Bovine mastitis caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Escherichia (E.) coli, is a major economic problem in dairy industry. In order to limit the presence of multi-resistant bacteria in bovine mastitis, alternatives for the treatment with antibiotics are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently been discussed as a potential new strategy against bacterial infections. They are key players in the innate immune system, as they can directly act against microorganisms or modulate the immune system. The aim of our study was to test S. aureus and E. toll mastitis isolates for their susceptibility to the bovine cathelicidins, BMAP-27 and BMAP-28. Susceptibility testing was performed in analogy to the broth microdilution criteria described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) to determine MICs of 50 clinical S. aureus and 50 clinical E. coli. isolates for BMAP-27 and BMAP-28. Based on the repetitive testing of four well-selected reference strains, the homogeneity of MIC variances for each peptide as well as the effect of temperature, oxygen level and plastic polymers on MIC testing was determined. Statistical analysis revealed not only strong peptide-specific variances, but also strain-specific variances in the technical procedure. Finally, using this technique, susceptibility testing of the field isolates revealed statistically significant peptide-specific differences in the MICs. While BMAP-27 showed lower MICs for E. coli, BMAP-28 showed lower MICs for S. aureus. However, these results clearly illustrate the need of susceptibility testing of AMPs on several unrelated strains and not only on one selected test organism.","Langer, Mn; Blodkamp, S; Bayerbach, M; Fessler, At; De Buhr, N; Gutsmann, T; Kreienbrock, L; Schwarz, S; Von Köckritz-Blickwede, M",10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.08.022,Veterinary Microbiology
Contribution Of Protein Synthesis Depression To Poly-Β-Hydroxybutyrate Accumulation In Synechocystis Sp. Pcc 6803 Under Nutrient-Starved Conditions,"Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in cyanobacteria, which accumulates as energy and carbon sources through the action of photosynthesis, is expected to substitute for petroleum-based plastics. This study first demonstrated that PHB accumulation was induced, with the appearance of lipid droplets, in sulfur (S)-starved cells of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, however, to a lower level than in nitrogen (N)- or phosphorus (P)-starved cells. Concomitantly found was repression of the accumulation of total cellular proteins in the S-starved cells to a similar level to that in N-starved cells, and a severer level than in P-starved cells. Intriguingly, PHB accumulation was induced in Synechocystis even under nutrient-replete conditions, upon repression of the accumulation of total cellular proteins through treatment of the wild type cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, chloramphenicol, or through disruption of the argD gene for Arg synthesis. Meanwhile, the expression of the genes for PHB synthesis was hardly induced in S-starved cells, in contrast to their definite up-regulation in N- or P-starved cells. It therefore seemed that PHB accumulation in S-starved cells is achieved through severe repression of protein synthesis, but is smaller than in N- or P-starved cells, owing to little induction of the expression of PHB synthesis genes.","Hirai, K; Nojo, M; Sato, Y; Tsuzuki, M; Sato, N",10.1038/s41598-019-56520-w,Scientific Reports
Molecular Toxicity Of Benzo(A)Pyrene Mediated By Elicited Oxidative Stress Infer Skeletal Deformities And Apoptosis In Embryonic Zebrafish,"Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has become an integral component of disposed of plastic waste, organic pollutants, and remnants of combustible materials in the aquatic environment due to their persistent nature. The accumulation and integration of these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have raised concern to human health and ecological safety. This study assessed the BaP-induced in vivo molecular toxicity with embryonic zebrafish inferred by oxidative stress and apoptosis. BaP was found to induce morphological and physiological abnormalities like delayed hatching (p < 0.05). Computational analysis demonstrated the high-affinity interaction of BaP with the zebrafish hatching enzyme (ZHE1) with Arg, Cys, Ala, Tyr, and Phe located at the active site revealing the influence of BaP on delayed hatching due to alteration of the enzyme structure. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant down-regulation of the skeletal genes Sox9a, SPP1/OPN, and Col1a1 (p < 0.05) genes. The cellular investigations unraveled that the toxicity of BaP extends to the skeletal regions of zebrafish (head, backbone, and tail) because of the elicited oxidative stress leading to apoptosis. The study extended the horizon of understanding of BaP toxicity at the molecular level which will enhance the indulgent and designing of techniques for better ecological sustainability.

Fully Bio-Based Intumescent Flame Retardant Hybrid: A Green Strategy Towards Reducing Fire Hazard And Improving Degradation Of Polylactic Acid,"Polylactic acid (PLA) is a promising renewable polymer material with excellent biodegradability and good mechanical properties. However, the easy flammability and slow natural degradation limited its further applications, especially in high-security fields. In this work, a fully bio-based intumescent flame-retardant system was designed to reduce the fire hazard of PLA. Firstly, arginine (Arg) and phytic acid (PA) were combined through electrostatic ionic interaction, followed by the introduction of starch as a carbon source, namely APS. The UL -94 grade of PLA/APS composites reached V -0 grade by adding 3 wt % of APS and exhibited excellent anti-dripping performance. With APS addition increasing to 7 wt %, LOI value increased to 26 % and total heat release decreased from 58.4 (neat PLA) to 51.1 MJ/m 2 . Moreover, the addition of APS increased its crystallinity up to 83.5 % and maintained the mechanical strength of pristine PLA. Noteworthy, APS accelerated the degradation rate of PLA under submerged conditions. Compared with pristine PLA, PLA/APS showed more apparent destructive network morphology and higher mass and M n loss, suggesting effective degradation promotion. This work provides a full biomass modification strategy to construct renewable plastic with both good flame retardancy and high degradation efficiency.","Xu, F; Ma, Wj; Wang, Wq; Wang, Hw; An, Sj; Zhu, Zg; Wang, R",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.131985,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
Improvement Of Biodegradation Of Pet Microplastics With Whole-Cell Biocatalyst By Interface Activation Reinforcement,"Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an important basic polymer, which was used widely in variety of fields. Due to its high crystallinity, compact structure and strong surface hydrophobicity, PET has prominent resistance to biodegradation. In recent years, microplastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics, was considered as serious threaten to ecosystems. In this study, alkali-resistant bacteria were used as whole-cell catalysts to try to improve the biodegradation of PET microplastics by increasing the bio-interfacial activity of the polymer substrate. Surfactants were applicated to enhance interfacial activation of enzyme and PET interactions. And an integrated strategy was constructed based on alkali resistant bacteria to catalysis the hydrolysis of PET. The results showed that Tween 20 had the most obvious promoting effect among the four interfacial biocatalysts on biological-chemical combined hydrolysis of PET microplastics with whole-cell biocatalysts in alkaline environment. Obvious etching and fracture were observed on the PET fibre surface after biodegradation in presence of surfactant. The weight loss rate of PET substrate can reach 11.04% after 5 days of biodegradation. Thus, this research provides a promising method for efficient degradation of PET microplastics.

The State Of Hand Rub Dispensers In Healthcare Settings - A Multicenter Assessment In 19 German Healthcare Facilities,"BackgroundHand hygiene is one of the most important hygiene measures to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Well-functioning hand rub dispensers are the foundation of hand hygiene but are often overlooked in research. As the point of origin for hand hygiene, dispensers not only promote compliance through ease of use, but also strongly influence the amount of hand rub used per disinfection. This work investigates how dispenser types and conditions affect dispensed volumes and usability.MethodsData from 5,014 wall-mounted or point-of-care dispensers was collected from 19 German healthcare facilities during installation of an electronic hand hygiene monitoring system, including dispenser type and dispensed hand rub volumes. Of these dispensers, 56.2% were metal dispensers, and the majority (89.5%) were wall-mounted. For one hospital, 946 wall-mounted dispensers were analyzed in detail regarding pump material, damages, functionality, cleanliness, and filling levels.ResultsDispensed volumes varied across and within dispenser types, ranging from 0.4 mL to 4.4 mL per full actuation, with the largest volumes generally dispensed by plastic dispensers with a preset of 1.0 to 3.0 mL per actuation. In general, most dispensers dispense more hand rub per full actuation than specified by the manufacturer. When different types of dispensers are used within a healthcare facility, vastly different volumes can be dispensed, making reliable and reproducible disinfection difficult for healthcare workers. In the detailed analysis of 946 dispensers, 27.1% had cosmetic defects, reduced performance, or were unusable, with empty disinfectant being the most common reason. Only 19.7% of working dispensers delivered their maximum volume on the first full actuation.ConclusionEven though several studies addressed the variability in dispensed volumes of hand hygiene dispensers, studies dealing with dispenser types and functionality are lacking, promoting the common but false assumption that different dispensers may be equivalent and interchangeable. Variability in dispensed volumes, coupled with frequent dispenser defects and maintenance issues, can be a major barrier to hand hygiene compliance. To support healthcare workers, more attention should be paid to 'dispenser compliance', selecting dispensers with similar volume ranges and proper maintenance.","Herzer, C; Berg, T; Hegemann, C; Gebhardt, T; Niesalla, H; Senges, C",10.1186/s13756-024-01470-w,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Μ-Opioid Receptor-Mediated Inhibition Of Intercalated Neurons And Effect On Synaptic Transmission To The Central Amygdala,"The amygdala is a key region for the processing of information underlying fear, anxiety, and fear extinction. Within the local neuronal networks of the amygdala, a population of inhibitory, intercalated neurons (ITCs) modulates the flow of information among various nuclei of amygdala, including the basal nucleus (BA) and the centromedial nucleus (CeM) of the amygdala. These ITCs have been shown to be important during fear extinction and are target of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we provide evidence that the activation of mu-opioid receptors (MORs) by the specific agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin) hyperpolarizes medially located ITCs (mITCs) in acute brain slices of mice. Moreover, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with local electrical stimulation or glutamate uncaging to analyze the effect of MOR activation on local microcircuits. We show that the GABAergic transmission between mITCs and CeM neurons is attenuated by DAMGO, whereas the glutamatergic transmission on CeM neurons and mITCs is unaffected. Furthermore, MOR activation induced by theta burst stimulation in BA suppresses plastic changes of feedforward inhibitory transmission onto CeM neurons as revealed by the MOR antagonist CTAP d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2. In summary, the mITCs constitute a target for the opioid system, and therefore, the activation of MOR in ITCs might play a central role in the modulation of the information processing between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and central nuclei of the amygdala.","Blaesse, P; Goedecke, L; Bazelot, M; Capogna, M; Pape, Hc; Jüngling, K",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0204-15.2015,Journal Of Neuroscience
The First Observation Of The Formation Of Persistent Aminoxyl Radicals And Reactive Nitrogen Species On Photoirradiated Nitrogen-Containing Microplastics,"Nitrogen-containing microplastics (N-MPs) are widely present in the atmosphere, but their potential health risks have been overlooked. In this study, the formation of persistent aminoxyl radicals (PAORs) and reactive nitrogen species (RNSs) on the N-MPs under light irradiation was investigated. After photoaging, an anisotropic triplet with the g-factor of similar to 2.0044, corresponding to PAORs, was detected on the nonaromatic polyamide (PA) rather than amino resin (AmR) by electron paramagnetic resonance and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The generated amine oxide portions on the photoaged PA were identified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, which were considered to be the main structural basis/precursors of a PAOR. Surprisingly, RNSs were also observed on the irradiated PA. The generated center dot NO due to the aphotolysis of nitrone groups simultaneously reacted with peroxide radicals and O-2 center dot(-) to yield center dot NO2 and peroxynitrite, respectively, which were responsible for peroxyacyl nitrates (PAN) and CO3 center dot- formation. Besides, a significantly higher oxidative potential and reductive potential were observed for the aged PA than AmR, which is assigned to the abundant RNSs, organic hydroperoxides and PANs, and a strong ability to transfer electrons from PAOR, respectively. This work provides important information for the potential risks of airborne N-MPs and may serve as a guide for future toxicological assessments.","Zhu, Kc; Jia, Hz; Jiang, Wj; Sun, Yj; Zhang, C; Liu, Z; Wang, Tc; Guo, Xt; Zhu, Ly",10.1021/acs.est.1c05650,Environmental Science & Technology
"The Sterility, Stability And Efficacy Of Repackaged Ziv-Aflibercept For Intravitreal Administration","To evaluate the sterility, stability, and efficacy of repackaged ziv-aflibercept in 1-mL plastic tuberculin syringes for intravitreal injection after storage for up to 90 days at controlled (4 degrees C) and ambient (25.8 degrees C) temperature. A total of 168 tuberculin-type 1-mL syringes were prepared containing ziv-aflibercept (100 mg/4 mL). Samples were stored at 4 degrees C and 25.8 degrees C for 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 90 days. At each time point, four samples were evaluated for the stability and binding affinity of anti-VEGF to VEGF (efficacy) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). All samples were analyzed for microbial growth. No microbial growth was obtained from any of the ziv-aflibercept samples during each time point, indicating that the repackaged ziv-aflibercept stored at 4 degrees C and 25.8 degrees C remained sterile. ELISA analysis revealed no significant decrease in concentration, and binding affinity was observed, indicating that the stability and efficacy were preserved. However, the concentration of ziv-aflibercept decreased less than the minimum expected concentration of 8 ng/mL after 60 days at 4 degrees C and after 30 days at 25.8 degrees C. The repackaged anti-VEGF drug ziv-aflibercept does not lose stability or efficacy and remains uncontaminated if prepared under sterile conditions and stored at 4 degrees C for up to 60 days or stored at 25.8 degrees C for up to 30 days.","Juhong, J; Pongsachareonnont, Pf; Somkijrungroj, T; Mavichak, A; Varadisai, A; Chariyavilaskul, P; Chatsuwan, T; Suttichet, Tb; Kulvichit, K",10.1038/s41598-022-06831-2,Scientific Reports
Dissemination And Genetic Relatedness Of Multidrug-Resistant And Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Isolates From A Burn Hospital In Iraq,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an aggressive opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes severe nosocomial infections, especially among burn patients. An increasing number of hospitals-acquired infections have been reported all over the world. However, little attention has been paid to the relatedness between A. baumannii isolates from different hospital environments and patients. In this study, 27 isolates were collected from the Burn and Plastic Surgery Hospital of Al Sulaymaniyah City, Iraq, from January through December 2019 (11 from patients and 16 from the wards environment), identified to species level as A. baumannii using Vitek 2 system and molecular detection of 16S rRNA gene, and then confirmed by targeting the blaOXA-51 gene. Moreover, the isolates were characterized by means of automated antimicrobial susceptibility assay, antimicrobial-resistant patterns, a phenotypic method using a combined disk test, and molecular methods for the detection of class A and C beta-lactamase genes, and finally, the genetic relatedness was classified. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 63% (17/27) of the retrieved A. baumannii isolates were extensively drug-resistant to 8/9 antimicrobial classes. Furthermore, 37% (10/27) of the isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant; 8 isolates exhibited similar resistant patterns and the other two isolates showed 2 different patterns, while resistance was greater in isolates from patients than from the ward environment. Combined disk test showed that two isolates contained extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. All isolates carried bla(TEM-1), and two copies of the bla(CTX-1) gene were indicated in one isolate, while blaSHV was absent in all isolates. Twenty-four isolates carried the bla(AmpC )gene; among them, 3 isolates harbored the insertion sequence ISAba-1 upstream to the gene. Using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR, the isolates were clustered into 6 distinct types; among them, two clusters, each of four strains, were classified to contain isolates from both patients and environments. The clusters of similar genotypes were found in inpatients as well as the environments of different wards during time periods, suggesting transmission within the hospital. Identification of possible infection sources and controlling the transmission of these aggressive resistance strains should be strictly conducted.","Shali, Aak; Jalal, Pj; Arif, Sk",10.1155/2022/8243192,Canadian Journal Of Infectious Diseases & Medical Microbiology
The Role Of Tumor Microenvironment In Chemoresistance: 3D Extracellular Matrices As Accomplices,"Background: The functional interplay between tumor cells and their adjacent stroma has been suggested to play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of tumors and the effectiveness of chemotherapy. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex network of extracellular proteins, provides both physical and chemicals cues necessary for cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Understanding how ECM composition and biomechanical properties affect cancer progression and response to chemotherapeutic drugs is vital to the development of targeted treatments. Methods: 3D cell-derived-ECMs and esophageal cancer cell lines were used as a model to investigate the effect of ECM proteins on esophageal cancer cell lines response to chemotherapeutics. Immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR evaluation of ECM proteins and integrin gene expression was done on clinical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma biopsies. Esophageal cancer cell lines (WHCO1, WHCO5, WHCO6, KYSE180, KYSE 450 and KYSE 520) were cultured on decellularised ECMs (fibroblasts-derived ECM; cancer cell-derived ECM; combinatorial-ECM) and treated with 0.1% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4.2 mu M cisplatin, 3.5 mu M 5-fluorouracil and 2.5 mu M epirubicin for 24 h. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, colony formation, apoptosis, migration and activation of signaling pathways were used as our study endpoints. Results: The expression of collagens, fibronectin and laminins was significantly increased in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) tumor samples compared to the corresponding normal tissue. Decellularised ECMs abrogated the effect of drugs on cancer cell cycling, proliferation and reduced drug induced apoptosis by 20-60% that of those plated on plastic. The mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways were upregulated in the presence of the ECMs. Furthermore, our data show that concomitant addition of chemotherapeutic drugs and the use of collagen- and fibronectin-deficient ECMs through siRNA inhibition synergistically increased cancer cell sensitivity to drugs by 30-50%, and reduced colony formation and cancer cell migration. Conclusion: Our study shows that ECM proteins play a key role in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and suggest that targeting ECM proteins can be an effective therapeutic strategy against chemoresistant tumors.","Senthebane, Da; Jonker, T; Rowe, A; Thomford, Ne; Munro, D; Dandara, C; Wonkam, A; Govender, D; Calder, B; Soares, Nc; Blackburn, Jm; Parker, Mi; Dzobo, K",10.3390/ijms19102861,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
The Endocrine Disruptor Bisphenol A (Bpa) Exerts A Wide Range Of Effects In Carcinogenesis And Response To Therapy,"Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic plasticizer that is commonly used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Human exposure occurs when BPA migrates from food and beverage containers into the contents when heated or even under normal conditions of use. BPA exerts endocrine disruptor action due to its weak binding affinity for the estrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta. BPA exerts other effects by activating the membrane receptor GPER (GPR30) and/or other receptors such as the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs). Objective: This review summarizes emerging data on BPA and cancer. These include data linking exposure to BPA with an increased risk of hormone-related cancers such as those of the ovary, breast, prostate, and even colon cancer. BPA can also induce resistance to various chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vinblastinc in vitro. The development of chemoresistance to available therapeutics is an emerging significant aspect of BPA toxicity because it worsens the prognosis of many tumors. Conclusion: Recent findings support a causal role of BPA at low levels in the development of cancers and in dictating their response to cytotoxic therapy. Accurate knowledge and consideration of these issues would be highly beneficial to cancer prevention and management.","Hafezi, Sa; Abdel-Rahman, Wm",10.2174/1874467212666190306164507,Current Molecular Pharmacology
Endocrine Disruption: Structural Interactions Of Androgen Receptor Against Di(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate And Its Metabolites,"Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride plastics for household and commercial use. DEHP is a ubiquitous ecocontaminant and causes developmental and reproductive problems in children and adults. After exposure, DEHP is metabolized by endogenous hydrolysis and oxidation into the primary metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and the secondary metabolites, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxhexyl)phthalate (5-OH-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (5-oxo-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (5-cx-MEPP), and mono-[(2-carboxymethyl)hexyl] phthalate (2-cx-MMHP). Very few studies have been reported on the adverse effects of DEHP metabolites, and the available information indicates that the metabolites might also be equally or more active as compared to the parent compound. In the present study, induced fit docking was used for structural binding characterization of the above five DEHP metabolites with androgen receptor (AR) to predict the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of these metabolites in AR signaling. All the DEHP metabolites interacted with the ligand-binding pocket of AR forming amino-acid residue interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi interactions. The binding energy of DEHP with AR was similar to that of native ligand testosterone. The amino-acid residue interactions of DEHP metabolites had 91-100% similarity compared to that of testosterone. In addition, all the DEHP metabolites and testosterone showed a common hydrogen bonding interaction with amino-acid Arg-752 of AR. Taken together, the structural binding data in the present study suggested the potential for DEHP metabolites to disrupt AR signaling, which may lead to androgen-related reproductive dysfunction.","Beg, Ma; Sheikh, Ia",10.3390/toxics8040115,Toxics
The Antibacterial Activities Of Honey,"Honey is a powerful antimicrobial agent with a wide range of effects. Various components contribute to the antibacterial efficacy of honey: the sugar content; polyphenol compounds; hydrogen peroxide; 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds; and bee defensin-1. All of these elements are present at different concentrations depending on the source of nectar, bee type, and storage. These components work synergistically, allowing honey to be potent against a variety of microorganisms including multidrug resistant bacteria and modulate their resistance to antimicrobial agents. The effectiveness and potency of honey against microorganisms depends on the type of honey produced, which is contingent on its botanical origin, the health of the bee, its origin, and processing method. The application of antibiotics with honey yielded better antimicrobial potential and synergistic effects were noted against biofilms. In medicine, honey has been used in the treatment of surface wounds, burns, and inflammation, and has a synergistic effect when applied with antibiotics. Tissue repair is enhanced by the low pH of honey (3.5-4): causing a reduction in protease activity on the wound site, elevating oxygen release from hemoglobin and stimulating fibroblast and macrophage activity. Furthermore, H2O2 has antiseptic effects, and it disinfects the wound site and stimulates production of vascular endothelial growth factor. The use of honey will clean wounds or burn areas from free radicals and reduces scarring and contractures. The anti-inflammatory and antibacterial potential of honey will keep the injured area moist and as such prevents it from deterioration and fibrosis. Honey can promote fast healing and reduce scarring and is very convenient for plastic surgery. Skin maceration is protected by honey due to its high osmolarity and because it keeps the injury moist. In noninfected areas, honey still reduced pain and inflammation. In general, the use of honey in medical settings has reduced economic loss and provided proven economic benefits by lowering direct costs in comparison to conventional treatments and by using less antibiotics, faster healing and less hospitalization stay. This review is intended to provide an overview of the antibacterial activities of honey and its applications. (C) 2020 The Author.

"Biosynthesis Of Gold Nanoparticles And Inhibition Of Various Stages Of Bacterial Biofilms Formed By Drug-Resistant Aeromonas Hydrophila, Escherichia Coli, And Klebsiella Pneumoniae","Biofilm development by bacteria is a serious issue in many different sectors, including the food, pharmaceutical, water, petroleum, and others. Because biofilms are difficult to remove due to their capacity to survive in bad environments, attempts were undertaken throughout this work to biologically manufacture gold nanoparticles with possible antibiofilm capabilities. During this study, 19 morphologically distinct fungal cultures were isolated from soil samples and used to synthesize gold nanoparticles. Among 19 fungi, 7 were producing gold nanoparticles and these particles were subjected to antimicrobial activity. Among 7 gold nanoparticles, nanoparticles synthesized from S2-10 isolate of fungi exhibited high antimicrobial activity toward biofilm-forming drug-resistant bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6 +/- 0.57 mm), Aeromonas hydrophila (13.3 +/- 0.57 mm) and Escherichia coli (10.0 +/- 1.0 mm), and was used for further studies. The chosen nanoparticle also shown strong anti-biofilm action against test microorganisms on a variety of material substrates, including plastic, metal, and glass. These nanoparticles also exhibited inhibition of microcolony/initial biofilm, mature and preformed biofilm formed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (53.42 +/- 4.45%, 62.14 +/- 7.45%, and 24.12 +/- 9.87%, respectively), Aeromonas hydrophila (43.89 +/- 0.95%, 59.79 +/- 1.19%, and 54.85 +/- 6.50%, respectively) and Escherichia coli (45.28 +/- 6.88%, 45.17 +/- 3.94%, and 32.39 +/- 4.16%, respectively). The physicochemical characterization of potential nanoparticles was conducted using UV-visible Spectrophotometer, X-ray diffractionSpectroscopy (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). These physicochemical analyses confirmed the formation of gold nanoparticles which were found to be spherical in shape with the size between 30 and 40 nm. Furthermore, the potential fungal isolate S2-10 was characterized as Aspergillus niger isolate CJ14 with the help of morphological and molecular techniques and deposited at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Accession number MN519438.1). Hence, it can be concluded that the gold nanoparticles produced using A. niger isolate CJ14 contain significant antibiofilm properties and can be used for developing antibiofilm products for future applications.","James, C; Kumar, G",10.1007/s00203-022-03325-7,Archives Of Microbiology
High-Specificity Synthesis Of Novel Monomers By Remodeled Alcohol Hydroxylase,"Background: Diols are important monomers for the production of plastics and polyurethanes, which are widely used in our daily life. The medium-chain diols with one hydroxyl group at its subterminal end are able to confer more flexibility upon the synthesized materials. But unfortunately, this type of diols has not been synthesized so far. The strong need for advanced materials impelled us to develop a new strategy for the production of these novel diols. In this study, we use the remodeled P450(BM3) for high-specificity production of 1,7-decanediol. Results: The native P450(BM3) was capable of converting medium-chain alcohols into corresponding alpha, omega 1-. alpha, omega 2- and alpha, omega 3-diols, with each of them accounting for about one third of the total diols, but it exhibited a little or no activity on the short-chain alcohols. Greatly improved regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation was obtained by laboratory evolution of P450(BM3). After substitution of 12 amino acid residues (J2-F87A), the ratio of 1,7-decanediol (omega-3 hydroxylation) to total decanediols increased to 86.8 % from 34.0 %. Structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the heme end residues such as Ala(78), Phe(87) and Arg(255) play a key role in controlling the regioselectivity of the alcohol hydroxylation, while the residues at the mouth of substrate binding site is not responsible for the regioselectivity. Conclusions: Herein we employ an engineered P450(BM3) for the first time to enable the high-specificity biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, which is a promising monomer for the development of advanced materials. Several key amino acid residues that control the regioselectivity of alcohol hydroxylation were identified, providing some new insights into how to improve the regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation. This report not only provides a good strategy for the biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, but also gives a promising approach for the production of other useful diols.","Zheng, Yn; Li, Ll; Liu, Q; Zhang, Hb; Cao, Yj; Xian, M; Liu, Hz",10.1186/s12896-016-0291-8,Bmc Biotechnology
Deciphering The Inhibition Mechanisms Of Microplastics On The Full-Stage Sludge Anaerobic Digestion Via Enrichment To Anaerobic Microbes And Toxicity Of Released Compounds,"Increasingly accumulated microplastics (MPs) in sludge could affect the sludge treatment process, while the contributions and mechanisms of MP particles and the released organic matters (MP-DOM) are not fully understood. To fill this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects and mechanisms of MPs on sludge anaerobic digestion. In the presence of MPs, the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organic matters and methanogenesis all decreased due to the inhibition on the activity of anaerobic microorganisms and key enzymes. Mechanism analysis showed that MPs mainly acted as substrates to enrich anaerobic microorganisms and reduced the abundance and function of free microorganisms in sludge that metabolized organic matters. Moreover, a large amount of organic compounds including various plasticizers (dibutyl phthalate) and chain scission products (benzoic acid) from physical abrasions of MPs with sludge particles, which made a 50.9-51.6 % contribution to the MP-inhibited sludge anaerobic digestion by the chemical toxicity and generated reactive oxygen species. Owing to the decreased digestion performance, the risk associated with ARGs and pathogenic bacteria increased distinctly. The findings highlight the concerns about MP-derived organic compounds compared to the substrate themselves and suggest the necessity for removing MPs in the sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).","Zhang, Zx; Liu, P; Zhang, Ts; Li, K; Wu, Xw; Qiang, H; Jia, Hz; Zhu, Ly",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136856,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Insights Into The Microbiome Of Breast Implants And Periprosthetic Tissue In Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma,"Though rare, breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a CD30+ T-cell lymphoma associated with textured breast implants, has adversely impacted our perception of the safety of breast implants. Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.","Walker, Jn; Hanson, Bm; Pinkner, Cl; Simar, Sr; Pinkner, Js; Parikh, R; Clemens, Mw; Hultgren, Sj; Myckatyn, Tm",10.1038/s41598-019-46535-8,Scientific Reports
Double Transverse Myocutaneous Gracilis Free Flaps For Unilateral Breast Reconstruction,"BackgroundIn cases were the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP flap) is not available and unilateral transverse myocutaneous gracilis flap (TMG flap) is not sufficient for breast reconstruction, we perform double TMG flaps as a reconstructive method. In this report, we present our results of the use of double TMG free-flap-transfer for unilateral breast reconstruction. Patients and MethodsBetween August 2004 and June 2012 we performed 58 TMG flaps in 29 patients for unilateral breast reconstruction. Patient data were analyzed and operative outcome (operation time, complication rate and aesthetic results) were investigated. Aesthetic outcome was evaluated retrospectively via photo documentation by an independent plastic surgeon. The results were classified in;unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good and very good. ResultsThe average operating time was 6 hours 55 minutes (295 - 650 minutes). Of 58 TMG flaps, 57 (98.3%) were successful. Thrombosis occurred in seven (12%) cases (1 arterial, 6 venous). Flap salvage was successful in six cases and flap failure occurred in one (1.7%) case. The results of 25 patients were graded as good and very good. Three patients showed satisfying and one patient unsatisfying results. ConclusionDouble TMG flaps in unilateral breast reconstruction could lead to good operative results. This method further expands the range of options with autologous tissue in reconstructive breast surgery. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Elevated Co2 Aggravated Polystyrene Microplastics Effects On The Rice-Soil System Under Field Conditions,"Polystyrene microplastics (PS) are decomposed very slowly due to their recalcitrance and inevitably interact with the changing climate. How the interaction between PS and increasing CO2 concentration affects the plant-soil system is rarely investigated. Here, a free-air CO2 enrichment system in farm fields was used to study the im-pacts of PS added to soil at 10 mg kg-1 on rice and soil bacterial communities at different CO2 levels (ambient-390 ppm and elevated-590 ppm). Results showed that single PS interfered with Fe, Mn and Zn uptake of rice, and it increased the abundances of bacteria taxa assigned to N turnover and urease activities, leading to altered soil N transformation and availability. Elevated CO2 alone enhanced rice photosynthesis, decreased the abundances of nitrogen-fixation bacteria, and induced co-occurrence patterns between bacteria simplified and decentralized. Combined PS and elevated CO2 significantly decreased rice stomatal conductance and transpi-ration rate by 56.70% and 29.46%, respectively, and further inhibited elements uptake. Besides, combined exposure significantly disturbed bacterial amino acid metabolism, and stimulated the adaptative responses of resistant bacteria. Overall, this study revealed that increasing CO2 concentrations may exacerbate the impacts of PS on rice performance and soil bacterial communities, providing new insights into the interaction between microplastics and climate change.","Xu, Ml; Xu, Q; Wang, Gb; Du, Wc; Zhu, Jg; Yin, Y; Ji, R; Wang, Xz; Guo, Hy",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120603,Environmental Pollution
Comprehensive Assessment Of Chlorination Disinfection On Microplastic-Associated Biofilms,"Chlorination on microplastic (MP) biofilms was comprehensively investigated with respect to disinfection efficiency, morphology, and core microbiome. The experiments were performed under various conditions: i) MP particles; polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), ii) MP biofilms; Escherichia coli for single-species and river water microorganisms for multiple-species, iii) different chlorine concentrations, and iv) different chlorine exposure periods. As a result, chlorination effectively inactivated the MP biofilm microorganisms. The disinfection efficiency increased with increasing the free chlorination concentration and exposure periods for both single- and multiple-species MP biofilms. The multiple-species MP biofilms were inactivated 1.3-6.0 times less than single-species MP biofilms. In addition, the PP-MP biofilms were more vulnerable to chlorination than the PS-MP biofilms. Morphology analysis verified that chlorination detached most MP biofilms, while a small part still remained. Interestingly, chlorination strongly changed the biofilm microbiome on MPs; the relative abundance of some microbes increased after the chlorination, suggesting they could be regarded as chlorine-resistant bacteria. Some potential pathogens were also remained on the MP particles after the chlorination. Notably, chlorination was effective in inactivating the MP biofilms. Further research should be performed to evaluate the impacts of residual MP biofilms on the environment.","Nguyen, Ht; Choi, W; Jeong, S; Bae, H; Oh, S; Cho, Kyj",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134751,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Endocrine Disruption: In Silico Interactions Between Phthalate Plasticizers And Corticosteroid Binding Globulin,"Endocrine disruption is a phenomenon when a man-made or natural compound interferes with normal hormone function in human or animal body systems. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have assumed considerable importance as a result of industrial activity, mass production of synthetic chemicals and environmental pollution. Phthalate plasticizers are a group of chemicals used widely and diversely in industry especially in the plastic industry, and many of the phthalate compounds have endocrine-disrupting properties. Increasing evidence indicates that steroid nuclear receptors and steroid binding proteins are the main targets of endocrine disruption. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a steroid binding protein that binds and transports cortisol in the blood circulation and is a potential target for endocrine disruption. An imbalance of cortisol in the body leads to many health problems. Induced fit docking of nine important and environmentally relevant phthalate plasticizers (DMP, BBP, DBP, DIBP, DnHP, DEHP, DINP, DnOP, DIDP) showed interactions with 10-19 amino acid residues of CBG. Comparison of the interacting residues of CBG with phthalate ligands and cortisol showed an overlapping of the majority (53-82%) of residues for each phthalate. Five of nine phthalate compounds and cortisol shared a hydrogen bonding interaction with the Arg-252 residue of CBG. Long-chain phthalates, such as DEHP, DINP, DnOP and DIDP displayed a higher binding affinity and formed a number of interactions with CBG in comparison to short-chain phthalates. The similarity in structural binding characteristics of phthalate compounds and native ligand cortisol suggested potential competitive conflicts in CBG-cortisol binding function and possible disruption of cortisol and progesterone homeostasis. Phthalates as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDC) have assumed considerable importance as a result of environmental pollution. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) transports cortisol in the blood circulation and is a potential target for endocrine disruption. An imbalance of cortisol in the body leads to many health problems. Induced fit docking of important phthalate plasticizers revealed similarity in structural binding characteristics of phthalate compounds and native ligand cortisol. These results suggest competitive conflicts in CBG-cortisol binding function and potential disruption of cortisol homeostasis.","Sheikh, Ia; Beg, Ma",10.1002/jat.3497,Journal Of Applied Toxicology
The Effect Of Chemical Hemodynamic Regulation On The Survival Of Arterialized Venous Flaps,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) on the microcirculation of arterialized venous flaps (AVFs) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect of hemodynamic regulation using nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and its agonist as a chemical intervention on the survival of AVF. A 10 x 8 cm arterialized venous flap was designed symmetrically on the rabbit abdomen. Thirty-six rabbits were used and randomly divided into three groups: control group, L-arg group and L-NAME group, respectively. The L-arg group and the L-NAME group received intraperitoneal injections of L-arginine (a NOS agonist, 1 g/kg/d) and L-NAME (nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, a NOS inhibitor, 50 mg/kg/d) respectively, whereas the control group received intraperitoneal injections of the same amount of saline. Flap viability, water content, status of vascular perfusion and gene expression of eNOS and HIF-1 alpha in each group were observed and analyzed. The average value of water content (venous congestion) in the L-arg group was the highest in comparison with the control group and the L-NAME group with a statistically significant difference (all p < .001). Similar results regarding blood perfusion state, gene expression of eNOS and HIF-1 alpha and flap survival status were found among the three groups. The early application of L- NAME as a chemical hemodynamic intervention could stop the cascade of flap swelling, congestion and necrosis due to overexpression of NO and be beneficial to the AVF survival. Our findings may develop a new strategy as a solution for the inconsistent survival of AVFs.","Zhao, B; Poonit, K; Zhou, Xj; Yao, Cl; Sun, C; Yan, Hd",10.1080/2000656X.2018.1550418,Journal Of Plastic Surgery And Hand Surgery
Metasurface Reflector (Msr) Loading For High Performance Small Microstrip Antenna Design,"A meander stripline feed multiband microstrip antenna loaded with metasurface reflector (MSR) structure has been designed, analyzed and constructed that offers the wireless communication services for UHF/microwave RFID and WLAN/WiMAX applications. The proposed MSR assimilated antenna comprises planar straight forward design of circular shaped radiator with horizontal slots on it and 2D metasurface formed by the periodic square metallic element that resembles the behavior of metamaterials. A custom made high dielectric bio-plastic substrate (epsilon(r) = 15) is used for fabricating the prototype of the MSR embedded planar monopole antenna. The details of the design progress through numerical simulations and experimental results are presented and discussed accordingly. The measured impedance bandwidth, radiation patterns and gain of the proposed MSR integrated antenna are compared with the obtained results from numerical simulation, and a good compliance can be observed between them. The investigation shows that utilization of MSR structure has significantly broadened the -10dB impedance bandwidth than the conventional patch antenna: from 540 to 632 MHz (17%), 467 to 606 MHz (29%) and 758 MHz to 1062 MHz (40%) for three distinct operating bands centered at 0.9, 3.5 and 5.5 GHz. Additionally, due to the assimilation of MSR, the overall realized gains have been upgraded to a higher value of 3.62 dBi, 6.09 dBi and 8.6 dBi for lower, middle and upper frequency band respectively. The measured radiation patterns, impedance bandwidths (S11<-10 dB) and gains from the MSR loaded antenna prototype exhibit reasonable characteristics that can satisfy the requirements of UHF/microwave (5.8 GHz) RFID, WiMAX (3.5/5.5 GHz) and WLAN (5.2/5.8 GHz) applications.","Ahsan, Mr; Islam, Mt; Ullah, Mh; Singh, Mj; Ali, Mt",10.1371/journal.pone.0127185,Plos One
The Impact Of Age On Perioperative Complications After Extremity Reconstruction With The Free Gracilis Flap: A Retrospective Cohort Study Involving 153 Patients,"Background The need for plastic and reconstructive surgery on elderly patients has been on the rise due to an increase in life expectancy in the past decades. Therefore, a study was conducted on young and elderly patients following microsurgical extremity reconstructions with free gracilis muscle flaps with the primary aim to investigate the influence of age and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score on the general outcome, as well as surgical and medical complications. Methods A retrospective analysis of 153 patients receiving free gracilis muscle flaps for extremity reconstructions between November 2009 and January 2018 was performed at two partner institutions specialized in microsurgical reconstructions. A logistic regression analysis was performed to correlate age and the ASA score with postoperative complication probability. Patients younger than 70 years were directly compared with elderly patients with respect to age, gender, ASA score, preexisting comorbidities, localization, and postoperative medical and surgical complications. Results Age turned out to be not significantly associated with major flap complications ( p =0.925) but with higher ASA scores ( p =0.016). However, an age-related significant increase in minor flap complications could be observed in the elderly ( p =0.008). A significant correlation between minor medical complications and age could be observed ( p =0.001) in contrast to ASA score ( p =0.912). Conclusion An increased minor flap, as well as minor and major medical complications, must be expected in extremity reconstructions with free gracilis flaps in elderly patients. Higher ASA scores correlate with a higher incidence of major flap complications. Septuagenarians are more prone to develop perioperative major medical complications than patients younger than 70 years. Age and general medical condition, coupled with the performance of each patient, should be thoroughly assessed individually to facilitate a tailored reconstructive approach using risk assessment tools and established scoring systems.","Weitgasser, L; Amr, A; Hladik, M; Wechselberger, G; Daigeler, A; Schoeller, T; Medved, F",10.1055/s-0038-1677455,Journal Of Reconstructive Microsurgery
Edna Adsorption Onto Microplastics: Impacts Of Water Chemistry And Polymer Physiochemical Properties,"Adsorption of biomacromolecules onto polymer surfaces, including microplastics (MPs), occurs in multiple environmental compartments, forming an ecocorona. Environmental DNA (eDNA), genetic material shed from organisms, can adsorb onto MPs which can potentially either (1) promote long-range transport of antibiotic resistant genes or (2) serve to gain insights into the transport pathways and origins of MPs by analyzing DNA sequences on MPs. However, little is known about the capacity of MPs to adsorb eDNA or the factors that influence sorption, such as polymer and water chemistries. Here we investigated the adsorption of extracellular linear DNA onto a variety of model MP fragments composed of three of the most environmentally prevalent polymers (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene) in their pristine and photochemically weathered states. Batch adsorption experiments in a variety of water chemistries were complemented with nonlinear modeling to quantify the rate and extent of eDNA sorption. Ionic strength was shown to strongly impact DNA adsorption by reducing or inhibiting electrostatic repulsion. Polyethylene terephthalate exhibited the highest adsorption capacity when normalizing for MP specific surface area, likely due to the presence of ester groups. Kinetics experiments showed fast adsorption (majority adsorbed under 30 min) before eventually reaching equilibrium after 1-2 h. Overall, we demonstrated that DNA quickly binds to MPs, with pseudo-first- and -second-order models describing adsorption kinetics and the Freundlich model describing adsorption isotherms most accurately. These insights into DNA sorption onto MPs show that there is potential for MPs to act as vectors for genetic material of interest, especially considering that particle-bound DNA typically persists longer in the environment than dissolved DNA.","Müller, Nd; Kirtane, A; Schefer, Rb; Mitrano, Dm",10.1021/acs.est.3c10825,Environmental Science & Technology
"Additive Genetic Variance For Traits Least Related To Fitness Increases With Environmental Stress In The Desert Locust, Schistocerca Gregaria","Under environmental stress, previously hidden additive genetic variation can be unmasked and exposed to selection. The amount of hidden variation is expected to be higher for life history traits, which strongly correlate to individual fitness, than for morphological traits, in which fitness effects are more ambiguous. However, no consensual pattern has been recovered yet, and this idea is still debated in the literature. Here, we hypothesize that the classical categorization of traits (i.e., life history and morphology) may fail to capture their proximity to fitness. In the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, a model organism for the study of insect polyphenism, we quantified changes in additive genetic variation elicited by lifetime thermal stress for ten traits, in which evolutionary significance is known. Irrespective of their category, traits under strong stabilizing selection showed genetic invariance with environmental stress, while traits more loosely associated with fitness showed a marked increase in additive genetic variation in the stressful environment. Furthermore, traits involved in adaptive phenotypic plasticity (growth compensation) showed either no change in additive genetic variance or a change of moderate magnitude across thermal environments. We interpret this mitigated response of plastic traits in the context of integrated evolution to adjust the entire phenotype in heterogeneous environments (i.e., adaptiveness of initial plasticity, compromise of phenotypic compensation with stress, and shared developmental pathway). Altogether, our results indicate, in agreement with theoretical expectations, that environmental stress can increase available additive genetic variance in some desert locust traits, but those closely linked to fitness are largely unaffected. Our study also highlights the importance of assessing the proximity to fitness of a trait on a case-by-case basis and in an ecologically relevant context, as well as considering the processes of canalization and plasticity, involved in the control of phenotypic variation.","Chapuis, Mp; Pélissié, B; Piou, C; Chardonnet, F; Pagès, C; Foucart, A; Chapuis, E; Jourdan-Pineau, H",10.1002/ece3.8099,Ecology And Evolution
Optimization Of Quenched Fluorescent Peptide Substrates Of Sars-Cov-2 3Clpro Main Protease (Mpro) From Proteomic Identification Of P6-P6' Active Site Specificity,"SARS-CoV-2 3C-like main protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for protein excision from the viral polyprotein. 3CL(pro) inhibitor drug development to block SARS-CoV-2 replication focuses on the catalytic non-prime (P) side for specificity and potency, but the importance of the prime (P') side in substrate specificity and for drug development remains underappreciated. We determined the P6-P6' specificity for 3CL(pro) from >800 cleavage sites that we identified using Proteomic Identification of Cleavage site Specificity (PICS). Cleavage occurred after the canonical P1-Gln and non-canonical P1-His and P1-Met residues. Moreover, P3 showed a preference for Arg/Lys and P3' for His. Essential H-bonds between the N-terminal Ser1 of protomer-B in 3CL(pro) dimers form with P1-His, but not with P1-Met. Nonetheless, cleavage occurs at P1-Met456 in native MAP4K5. Elevated reactive oxygen species in SARS-CoV-2 infection oxidize methionines. Molecular simulations revealed P1-Met(OX) forms an H-bond with Ser1 and notably, strong positive cooperativity between P1-Met with P3'-His was revealed, which enhanced peptide-cleavage rates. The highly plastic S3' subsite accommodates P3 '-His that displays stabilizing backbone H-bonds with Thr25 lying central in a threonine trio (Thr24-Thr25-Thr26) in the P'-binding domain I. Molecular docking simulations unveiled structure-activity relationships impacting 3CL(pro)-substrate interactions, and the role of these structural determinants was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS cleavage assays of P1'- and P3'-positional scanning peptide libraries carrying a 2nd optimal cut-site as an internal positive control. These data informed the design of two new and highly soluble 3CL(pro)quenched-fluorescent peptide substrates for improved FRET monitoring of 3CL(pro) activity with 15x improved sensitivity over current assays. IMPORTANCE From global proteomics identification of >800 cleavage sites, we characterized the P6-P6' active site specificity of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) using proteome-derived peptide library screens, molecular modeling simulations, and focussed positional peptide libraries. In P1', we show that alanine and serine are cleaved 3x faster than glycine and the hydrophobic small amino acids Leu, Ile, or Val prevent cleavage of otherwise optimal non-prime sequences. In characterizing non-canonical non-prime P1 specificity, we explored the unusual P1-Met specificity, discovering enhanced cleavage when in the oxidized state (P1-Met(OX)). We unveiled unexpected amino acid cooperativity at P1-Met with P3 '-His and noncanonical P1-His with P2-Phe, and the importance of the threonine trio (Thr24-Thr25-Thr26) in the prime side binding domain I in defining prime side binding in SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). From these analyses, we rationally designed quenched-fluorescence natural amino acid peptide substrates with >15x improved sensitivity and high peptide solubility, facilitating handling and application for screening of new antiviral drugs.","De Jesus, Hcr; Solis, N; Machado, Y; Pablos, I; Bell, Pa; Kappelhoff, R; Grin, Pm; Sorgi, Ca; Butler, Gs; Overall, Cm",10.1128/jvi.00049-24,Journal Of Virology
The Effect Of Graphene Oxide And Sebs-G-Mah Compatibilizer On Mechanical And Thermal Properties Of Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene/Talc Composite,"In this study, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)/talc/graphene oxide/SEBS-g-MAH (ABS/Talc/GO/SEBS-g-MAH) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/graphene oxide/SEBS-g-MAH (ABS/GO/SEBS-g-MAH) composites were isolated with varying graphene oxide (0.5 to 2.0 phr) as a filler and SEBS-g-MAH as a compatibilizer (4 to 8 phr), with an ABS:talc ratio of 90:10 by percentage. The influences of graphene oxide and SEBS-g-MAH loading in ABS/talc composites were determined on the mechanical and thermal properties of the composites. It was found that the incorporation of talc reduces the stiffness of composites. The analyses of mechanical and thermal properties of composites revealed that the inclusion of graphene oxide as a filler and SEBS-g-MAH as a compatibilizer in the ABS polymer matrix significantly improved the mechanical and thermal properties. ABS/talc was prepared through melt mixing to study the fusion characteristic. The mechanical properties showed an increase of 30%, 15%, and 90% in tensile strength (TS), flexural strength (FS), and flexural modulus (FM), respectively. The impact strength (IS) resulted in comparable properties to ABS, and it was better than the ABS/talc composite due to the influence of talc in the composite that stiffens and reduces the extensibility of plastic. The incorporation of GO and SEBS-g-MA also shows a relatively higher thermal stability in both composites with and without talc. The finding of the present study reveals that the graphene oxide and SEBS-g-MAH could be utilized as a filler and a compatibilizer in ABS/talc composites to enhance the thermo-mechanical stability because of the superior interfacial adhesion between the matrix and filler.","Abedin, Fnj; Hamid, Ha; Alkarkhi, Afm; Abu Amr, Ss; Khalil, Na; Yahaya, Ana; Hossain, Ms; Hassan, A; Zulkifli, M",10.3390/polym13183180,Polymers
Between Source And Sea: The Role Of Wastewater Treatment In Reducing Marine Microplastics,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a focal point for the removal of microplastic (MP) particles before they are discharged into aquatic environments. WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 mu m, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers.","Freeman, S; Booth, Am; Sabbah, I; Tiller, R; Dierking, J; Klun, K; Rotter, A; Ben-David, E; Javidpour, J; Angel, Dl",10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110642,Journal Of Environmental Management
The Effecting Mechanisms Of 100 Nm Sized Polystyrene Nanoplastics On The Typical Coastal Alexandrium Tamarense,"Due to the increase in nanoplastics (NPs) abundance in aquatic environments, their effects on phytoplankton have aroused large research attention. In this study, 100 nm sized polystyrene NPs were chosen to investigate their effecting performance and mechanisms on a typical dinoflagellates Alexandrium tamarense. The results indicated the population growth and photosynthetic efficiencies of A. tamarense were significantly inhibited by NPs exposure, as well as the increase in cellular total carotenoids and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). Meanwhile, the cellar ROS levels increased, corresponding to the increased activities or contents of multiple antioxidant components, including SOD, CAT, GPX, GR, GSH and GSSG. The transcriptional results support the physiological-biochemical results and further revealed the down-regulation of genes encoding the light reaction centers (PSI and PSII) and up-regulation of genes encoding the antioxidant components. Up-regulation of genes encoding key enzymes of the Calvin cycle and glycolytic pathway together with the TCA cycle could accelerate organic carbon and ATP production for A. tamarense cells resistant to NPs stress. Finally, more Glu and acetyl-CoA produced by the enhanced GSH cycle and the glycolytic pathway, respectively, accompanied by the up-regulation of Glu and Arg biosynthesis genes supported the increase in the PST contents under NPs exposure. This study established a data set involving physiological-biochemical changes and gene information about marine dinoflagellates responding to NPs, providing a data basis for further evaluating the ecological risk of NPs in marine environments.","Li, Ly; Liu, Q; Li, B; Zhao, Y",10.3390/ijms25137297,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
On-Flow Immobilization Of Polystyrene Microspheres On Β-Cyclodextrin-Patterned Silica Surfaces Through Supramolecular Host Guest Interactions,"Species-specific isolation of microsized entities such as microplastics and resistant bacteria from waste streams is becoming a growing environmental challenge. By studying the on-flow immobilization of micron-sized polystyrene particles onto functionalized silica surfaces, we ascertain if supramolecular host guest chemistry in aqueous solutions can provide an alternative technology for water purification. Polystyrene particles were modified with different degrees of adamantane (guest) molecules, and silica surfaces were patterned with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD, host) through microcontact printing (mu CP). The latter was exposed to solutions of these particles flowing at different speeds, allowing us to study the effect of flow rate and multivalency on particle binding to the surface. The obtained binding profile was correlated with Comsol simulations. We also observed that particle binding is directly aligned with particle's ability to form host guest interactions with the beta-CD-patterned surface, as particle binding to the functionalized glass surface increased with higher adamantane load on the polystyrene particle surface. Because of the noncovalent character of these interactions, immobilization is reversible and modified beta-CD surfaces can be recycled, which provides a positive outlook for their incorporation in water purification systems.","Willems, Sbj; Bunschoten, A; Wagterveld, Rm; Van Leeuwen, Fwb; Velders, Ah",10.1021/acsami.9b11069,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Interactive Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastics And Pb On Growth And Phytochemicals In Mung Bean (Vigna Radiata L.),"Interaction of different pollutants can aggravate hazards to biotic components in agroecosystems. Microplastics (MPs) are especially needed to be focused on because of their increasing use in life around the globe. We investigated the interactive impacts of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MP) and lead (Pb) on mung bean (Vigna radiata L.). Toxicity of MPs and Pb directly impeded V. radiata attributes. In combination i.e., M2P2 (40 mu M Pb + 4.0 mg L-1 MPs) predominantly reduced the shoot root fresh and dry weights. \ Pb and PS-MP impaired the Rubisco activity and chlorophyll contents. The dose dependent relationship (M2P2) discomposed indole 3-acetic acid by 59.02%. Individual treatments P2 (40 mu M Pb) and M2 (4.0 mg L-1 MPs) respectively instigated a decline (44.07% and 27.12%) in IBA, while ABA was elevated. M2 significantly enhanced the contents of Alanine (Ala), Arginine (Arg), Proline (Pro), and glycine (Gly) by 64.11%, 63%, and 54% compared to control. Lysine (Lys) and Valine (Val) presented a converse relationship with other amino acids. Except for control, a gradual decline in yield parameters were observed in individual and combined applications of PS-MP. Proximate composition of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins also reflected a clear decrease in these compounds after combined application of Pb and MPs. Although, individual doses caused a decline in these compounds but effect of combined doses Pb and PS-MP was highly significant. Our results demonstrated the toxicity effect of Pb and MP in V. radiata attributes that is mainly linked with cumulative physiological and metabolic perturbations. These collective negative impacts of different doses of MPs and Pb on V. radiata would certainly pose serious implications for humans.","Chen, F; Aqeel, M; Khalid, N; Nazir, A; Irshad, Mk; Akbar, Mu; Alzuaibr, Fm; Ma, J; Noman, A",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.130966,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Mechanism Of Nanoplastics Capture By Jellyfish Mucin And Its Potential As A Sustainable Water Treatment Technology,"The accumulation of nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has raised concerns about their impact on human health and the biosphere. The main aim of this study is to understand the mechanism that governs the capture of NPs by jellyfish mucus extracted from the jellyfish Aurelia sp. (A.a.) and compare the capture/removal efficiency to that of conventional coagulants and mucus from other organisms. The efficacy of A.a mucus to capture polystyrene and acrylic NPs (similar to 100 nm) from spiked wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was evaluated. The mucus effect on capture kinetics and destabilization of NPs of different polymer compositions, sizes and concentrations was quantified by means of fluorescent NPs, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. A dosing of A.a. mucus equivalent to protein concentrations of similar to 2-4 mg L-1 led to a rapid change in zeta potential from a baseline of -30 mV to values close to 0 mV, indicating a marked change from a stable to a non-stable dispersion leading to a rapid (<10 min) and significant removal of NPs (60 %-90 %) from a stable suspension. The A.a. mucus outperformed all other mucus types (0-37 %) and coagulants (0 %-32 % for ferric chloride; 23-40 % for poly aluminum chlorohydrate), highlighting the potential for jellyfish mucus to be used as bio-flocculant. The results indicate a mucus-particle interaction consisting of adsorption-bridging and mesh filtration. Further insight is provided by carbohydrate composition and protein disruption analysis. Total protein disruption resulted in a complete loss of the A.a. mucus capacity to capture NPs, while the breaking of disulfide bonds and protein unfolding resulted in improved capture capacity. The study demonstrates that natural jellyfish mucin can capture and remove NPs in water and wastewater treatment systems more efficiently than conventional coagulants, highlighting the potential for development of a new type of bio-flocculant.","Ben-David, Ea; Habibi, M; Haddad, E; Sammar, M; Angel, Dl; Dror, H; Lahovitski, H; Booth, Am; Sabbah, I",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161824,Science Of The Total Environment
"Prospective Outcomes Of Noma Facial Reconstructive Surgery In Sokoto, Nigeria","Background: Noma is a gangrenous infection of the face that results in severe facial deformity, occurring primarily in malnourished and impoverished populations. Objective: To assess clinician- and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) before and after reconstructive surgery for patients with noma in northwest Nigeria. Methods: Objective outcomes were recorded using the noma-specific NOITULP (nose, outer cheek, inner cheek, trismus, upper/lower lip, particularities) classification system. PROs were recorded using a locally developed tool. Postsurgical changes were assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank testing. Linear regression was used to look for associated risk factors. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the NOITULP score was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic. Results: Forty-nine patients (median age 25 years, 71% male) underwent local/regional flap reconstruction and/or trismus release. Twelve complications were reported. Univariate analysis showed a 3.20 change in PRO score (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 5.81, p = 0.018) per kilogram the patient underwent at time of surgery. The NOITULP score improved from a presurgery median of 3.5 to 2.3 (p < 0.0001), however, the IRR was poor (kappa = 0.0894, p < 0.0001). The PRO score also improved from a median of 7.0 to 12.0 (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Facial reconstructive surgery improves the NOITULP score and PROs in patients with noma in northwest Nigeria. Clinical Trial Registration: OCA017-63.","Amirtharajah, M; Olaleye, M; Oluyide, B; Lenglet, A; Ariti, C; Farley, E; Winters, R; Taiwo, Ao; Shaye, Da",10.1089/fpsam.2023.0079,Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine

Guidelines For The Use And Interpretation Of Assays For Monitoring Autophagy (4Th Edition),"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.","Klionsky, Dj; Abdel-Aziz, Ak; Abdelfatah, S; Abdellatif, M; Abdoli, A; Abel, S; Abeliovich, H; Abildgaard, Mh; Abudu, Yp;

Microplastics Accumulate Priority Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens: Evidence From The Riverine Plastisphere.,"Microplastics (MPs) might accumulate and transport antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in aquatic systems. We determined the abundance and diversity of culturable ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria in biofilms covering MPs placed in river water, and characterized priority pathogens from these biofilms. Our results showed that the abundance of ARB colonizing MPs tends to be higher compared to sand particles. Also, higher numbers were cultivated from a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), compared to PP and PET alone. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas isolates were the most frequently retrieved from MPs placed before a WWTP discharge while Enterobacteriaceae dominated the culturable plastisphere 200 m after the WWTP discharge. Ciprofloxacin- and/or cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 54 unique isolates) were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 9), Enterobacter spp. (n = 4) and Shigella sp. (n = 1). All isolates presented at least one of the virulence features tested (i.e. biofilm formation, haemolytic activity and production of siderophores), 70% carried the intI1 gene and 85% exhibited a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [ aacA4-cr (40% of the isolates), qnrS (30%), qnrB (25%), and qnrVC (8%)], along with mutations in gyrA (70%) and parC (72%). Cefotaxime-resistant strains (n = 23) harbored bla CTX-M (70%), bla TEM (61%) and bla SHV (39%). Among CTX-M producers, high-risk clones of E. coli (e.g. ST10 or ST131) and K. pneumoniae (ST17) were identified, most of which carrying bla CTX-M-15. Ten out of 16 CTX-M producers were able to transfer bla CTX-M to a recipient strain. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the riverine plastisphere, harboring ARGs of clinical concern and exhibiting virulence traits, suggesting a contribution of MPs to the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens. The type of MPs and especially water contamination (e.g. by WWTPs discharges) seem to determine the resistome of the riverine plastisphere. [Display omitted] • MPs had higher antibiotic-resistant bacteria levels than sand. • Antibiotic-resistant bacteria abundance depended on the MP type. • Abundance of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae increased after WWTP discharge. • MPs hosted high-risk clones of priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens. • The plastisphere contained clinically concerning mobile ARGs (e.g. bla CTX-M).","Silva, Isabel ; Rodrigues, Elsa T. ; Tacão, Marta ; Henriques, Isabel",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121995,Environmental Pollution
Microplastics Aided Augmentation Of Antibiotic Resistance In Wwtps: A Global Concern.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment are the major subject of concern across the globe as they jeopardize not only aquatic life but human health as well. MPs are potentially competent to adsorb various micropollutants (heavy metals), bacterial communities, and biofilm formation which comply with the requirement of efficient sorption of antibiotics and transfer of ARGs. MPs adsorb antibiotics through physicochemical interactions, leading to the formation of biofilm-enriched bacteria on the surfaces of MPs that further enhances the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and facilitates their dispersal. Therefore, this review recapitulates the interactive forces responsible for antibiotics sorption on MPs and also the intricate relationship between MPs, antibiotics, and microbial hosts of ARGs. Furthermore, the role of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which serve as a formidable connecting link between MPs and the ecosystem, is discussed in relation to dissemination of antibiotics, ARGs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) to get a clear perception of the contribution of WWTPs in drawing together MPs with antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs.","Rajput, Meenakshi ; Mathur, Nupur ; Singh, Anuradha ; Bhatnagar, Pradeep",10.1007/s11270-024-07326-8,"Water, Air & Soil Pollution"
Microplastics Exacerbate The Ecological Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wetland Ecosystem.,"Wetlands are vital components of the global ecosystem, significantly influencing the retention and dissemination of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the effects of different types of MPs on the environmental dynamics of ARGs within these ecosystems remain poorly understood. This study focused on the distribution and composition of ARGs associated with two primary types of MPs—polyethylene and polypropylene—within the Poyang Lake wetland, the largest freshwater lake in China, utilizing metagenomic analysis. The findings demonstrated that the bacterial communities and ARG profiles in the plastisphere were markedly distinct from those in the surrounding water. Specifically, thirteen opportunistic pathogens and forty subtypes of ARGs, primarily related to multidrug, bacitracin, and β-lactam resistance, were identified in the plastisphere. Notably, polyethylene exhibited four times more specific ARG subtypes than polypropylene. Procrustes analysis combined with network analysis indicated a lack of strong correlation between ARG abundance and bacterial populations, suggesting potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within the microbiota of the plastisphere. Additionally, three novel and functional β-lactamase genes were identified within this environment. This investigation highlights the role of MPs as reservoirs for ARGs, facilitating their exchange and posing risks to both ecological integrity and human health, thereby underscoring the need for increased attention in future research efforts. • Microplastics significantly enriched pathogenic bacteria and ARGs. • Polyethylene harbored 4-fold more ARG subtypes than polypropylene. • Potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within microplastic microbiota. • Three novel β-lactamases were identified in plastisphere.","Liu, Shuli ; Cao, Jian ; Yu, Jinli ; Jian, Minfei ; Zou, Long",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123359,Journal Of Environmental Management
The Combination Of Polystyrene Microplastics And Di (2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate Promotes The Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Between Bacteria.,"Plastic pollution has become a common phenomenon. The process of plastic degradation is accompanied by the release of microplastics and plasticizers. However, the coexistence of microplastics and plasticizers on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not been reported until now. Here, polystyrene (PS) microplastics and plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were used for combined treatment experiment and their effects and mechanisms on the transfer of ARGs between bacteria were explored. By increasing cell membrane permeability and the expression of correlated genes, the combined treatment group showed promoting effects on the transfer of ARGs than that of control, with the highest promoting effects observed at 1 mg/L PS and 0.1 mg/L DEHP, which was 3.0 times higher in ARGs transfer rate than that of control. It was found that PS and DEHP treatment alone also led to a higher conjugative transfer frequency, and the frequency of the combined treatment was lower than that of the corresponding single treatment group. This indicated that the effects of DEHP and microplastics on ARGs transfer might be antagonistic. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the transfer of ARGs affects bacterial ion binding, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism processes, while the expression of genes related to cell membrane permeability, DNA repair, bacterial drug resistance, and quorum sensing also increase. This study may provide new insights for explaining the combined effects of various pollutants in the environment on the spread of ARGs. [Display omitted] • Combined effects of nanoplastics and DEHP on conjugative transfer was analyzed. • The aggregation of nanoplastics and its adsorption on DEHP reduced combined effects. • The co-addition of nanoplastics and DEHP can promote the transfer of ARGs.","Li, Yu ; Liu, Xiaomei ; Guo, Saisai ; Wang, Lan ; Tang, Jingchun",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.117681,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
Marine Plastisphere Selectively Enriches Microbial Assemblages And Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Long-Term Cultivation Periods.,"Several studies have focused on identifying and quantifying suspended plastics in surface and subsurface seawater. Microplastics (MPs) have attracted attention as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the marine environment. Plastispheres, specific biofilms on MP, can provide an ideal niche to spread more widely through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), thereby increasing risks to ecosystems and human health. However, the microbial communities formed on different plastic types and ARG abundances during exposure time in natural marine environments remain unclear. Four types of commonly used MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were periodically cultured (46, 63, and 102 d) in a field-based marine environment to study the co-selection of ARGs and microbial communities in marine plastispheres. After the first 63 d of incubation (p < 0.05), the initial 16S rRNA gene abundance of microorganisms in the plastisphere increased significantly, and the biomass subsequently decreased. These results suggest that MPs can serve as vehicles for various microorganisms to travel to different environments and eventually provide a niche for a variety of microorganisms. Additionally, the qPCR results showed that MPs selectively enriched ARGs. In particular, tetA, tetQ, sul1, and qnrS were selectively enriched in the PVC-MPs. The abundances of intl1 , a mobile genetic element, was measured in all MP types for 46 d (5.22 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 8.21 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies), 63 d (5.90 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 2.49 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies), and 102 d (4.00 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 5.11 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies). Network analysis indicated that ARG profiles co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria. This study suggests that the selection of ARGs and their co-occurring bacteria in MPs could potentially accelerate their transmission through HGT in natural marine plastics. [Display omitted] • Co-selection of microbial assemblages and ARGs was explored in a field-based marine plastisphere. • Selective ARG enrichment, notably in PVC, poses health and eco risks. • Intl1, tetA, tetQ, ermB , and sul1 co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria on the MP surface.","Kim, Hyunsu ; Yoo, Keunje",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123450,Environmental Pollution
Alteration Of The Migration Trajectory Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes By Microplastics In A Leachate Activated Sludge System.,"The environmental behavior of emerging contaminants of microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the leachate activated sludge system has been monitored and analyzed comprehensively. The results suggested that MPs could effectively alter the migration trajectory of tetracycline resistance genes (tet genes) in the leachate activated sludge system under intermittent and continuous influent conditions. After adding MPs, the total average abundance of tet genes in leachate increased from 0.74 ± 0.07 to 0.78 ± 0.07 (log 10 tet genes/log 10 16S rRNA) and that in sludge increased from 0.65 ± 0.08 to 0.70 ± 0.06 (log 10 tet genes/log 10 16S rRNA). Except for tetA , the abundance of tetB , tetO , tetM and tetQ on MPs increased with increasing TC concentration under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. MPs not only significantly affect the abundance level and migration trajectory of ARGs in the leachate activated sludge system, but also remarkably improve the level of heavy metals in the ambient environment, indirectly promoting the selective effect of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and promoting the development of antibiotic resistance (AR). In addition, MPs changed their physicochemical properties and released hazardous substances with aging to force tet genes to migrate from the leachate activated sludge system to the MPs, making AR more difficult to eliminate and persisted in wastewater treatment plants. Meanwhile, microorganisms played a driving role, making MPs serve as a niche for ARGs and ARB colonization. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated the specific distribution pattern of tet genes and microorganisms in different media, and the potential host was speculated. This study improves the understanding of the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants in leachate activated sludge system and lays a theoretical for protecting the ecological environment. [Display omitted] • MPs altered the migration trajectory of tet genes in leachate biotreatment system. • MPs as enrichment carriers of ARGs and ARB promote the persistence of AR. • The abundance of tet (B , O , M and Q) on MPs increased with increasing TC. • MPs remarkably elevated the levels of ARGs and heavy metals in leachate environment. • MPs are ubiquitous in leachate activated sludge system and compete for ARGs.","Liu, Hongyuan ; Li, Hong ; Qiu, Libo ; Xie, Qiaona ; Lu, Yingying ; Chen, Binhui ; Wang, Hua ; Long, Yuyang ; Hu, Lifang ; Fang, Chengran",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121981,Environmental Pollution
Metagenomic Insights Into Ecological Risk Of Antibiotic Resistome And Mobilome In Riverine Plastisphere Under Impact Of Urbanization.,"[Display omitted] • Urbanization shaped the distribution of antibiotic resistome in plastisphere. • Population density was the key factor for proliferating antibiotic resistome. • Polymer types of microplastics affected antibiotic resistome and mobilome. • Leaf-biofilms harbored the lowest levels of mobile genetic elements. • Polylactic acid could serve as an alternative to traditional plastics. Microplastics (MPs) are of increasing concern due to their role as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. To date, few studies have explored the influence of anthropogenic activities on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within various riverine MPs, in comparison to their natural counterparts. Here an in-situ incubation was conducted along heavily anthropogenically-impacted Houxi River to characterize the geographical pattern of antibiotic resistome, mobilome and pathogens inhabiting MPs- and leaf-biofilms. The metagenomics result showed a clear urbanization-driven profile in the distribution of ARGs, MGEs and pathogens, with their abundances sharply increasing 4.77 to 19.90 times from sparsely to densely populated regions. The significant correlation between human fecal marker crAssphage and ARG (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.67, P =0.003) indicated the influence of anthropogenic activity on ARG proliferation in plastisphere and natural leaf surfaces. And mantel tests and random forest analysis revealed the impact of 17 socio-environmental factors, e.g., population density, antibiotic concentrations, and pore volume of materials, on the dissemination of ARGs. Partial least squares-path modeling further unveiled that intensifying human activities not only directly boosted ARGs abundance but also exerted a comparable indirect impact on ARGs propagation. Furthermore, the polyvinylchloride plastisphere created a pathogen-friendly habitat, harboring higher abundances of ARGs and MGEs, while polylactic acid are not likely to serve as vectors for pathogens in river, with a lower resistome risk score than that in leaf-biofilms. This study highlights the diverse ecological risks associated with the dissemination of ARGs and pathogens in varied MPs, offering insights for the policymaking of usage and control of plastics within urbanization.","Yan, Weifu ; Bai, Rui ; Zhang, Qinghua ; Jiang, Yuhao ; Chen, Geng ; Zhang, Yanru ; Wu, Yicheng ; Guo, Xuetao ; Xiao, Yong ; Zhao, Feng",10.1016/j.envint.2024.108946,Environment International
Distinct Species Turnover Patterns Shaped The Richness Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Eight Different Microplastic Polymers.,"Elucidating the formation mechanism of plastisphere antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on different polymers is necessary to understand the ecological risks of plastisphere ARGs. Here, we explored the turnover and assembly mechanism of plastisphere ARGs on 8 different microplastic polymers (4 biodegradable (bMPs) and 4 non-biodegradable microplastics (nMPs)) by metagenomic sequencing. Our study revealed the presence of 479 ARGs with abundance ranging from 41.37 to 58.17 copies/16S rRNA gene in all plastispheres. These ARGs were predominantly multidrug resistance genes. The richness of plastisphere ARGs on different polymers had a significant correlation with the contribution of species turnover to plastisphere ARGs β diversity. Furthermore, polymer type was the most critical factor affecting the composition of plastisphere ARGs. More opportunistic pathogens carrying diverse ARGs on BMPs (PBAT, PBS, and PHA) with higher horizontal gene transfer potential may further magnify the ecological risks and human health threats. For example, the opportunistic pathogens Riemerella anatipestifer , Vibrio campbellii , and Vibrio cholerae are closely related to human production and life, which were the important potential hosts of many plastisphere ARGs and mobile genetic elements on BMPs. Thus, we emphasize the urgency of developing the formation mechanism of plastisphere ARGs and the necessity of controlling BMPs and ARG pollution, especially BMPs, with ever-increasing usage in daily life. [Display omitted] • Polymer types were the main factor that shaped the composition of plastisphere ARGs. • Plastisphere ARGs on different polymers had distinct turnover and assembly patterns. • Multidrug resistance genes were the main components of plastisphere ARGs. • BMPs may further increase the co-occurrence and horizontal transfer of ARGs.","Zhang, Weihong ; Geng, Jun ; Sun, Mengge ; Jiang, Chunxia ; Lin, Hui ; Chen, Haiyang ; Yang, Yuyi",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119562,Environmental Research
Ecotoxicological Effects Of Microplastics Combined With Antibiotics In The Aquatic Environment: Recent Developments And Prospects.,"Both microplastics and antibiotics are commonly found contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics have the ability to absorb antibiotic pollutants in water, but the specific adsorption behavior and mechanism are not fully understood, particularly in relation to the impact of microplastics on toxicity in aquatic environments. We review the interaction, mechanism, and transport of microplastics and antibiotics in water environments, with a focus on the main physical characteristics and environmental factors affecting adsorption behavior in water. We also analyze the effects of microplastic carriers on antibiotic transport and long‐distance transport in the water environment. The toxic effects of microplastics combined with antibiotics on aquatic organisms are systematically explained, as well as the effect of the adsorption behavior of microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, the scientific knowledge gap and future research directions related to the interactions between microplastics and antibiotics in the water environment are summarized to provide basic information for preventing and treating environmental risks.

Plastic Debris In The Aquatic Environment: An Emerging Substratum For Antimicrobial Resistant (Amr) Biofilms.,"Plastic pollution has quadrupled over the past years and has become a global concern due to its direct impact on life forms. The present study analysed whether the plastic debris in aquatic environments could act as the substratum for the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria to form biofilm for survival. We have collected various plastic debris (n = 32) from six sites of the Periyar River, the drinking water source for the entire city and one of the most polluted rivers in Kerala (India). The chemical composition of plastics was screened via FTIR analysis and found that they comprised two types, viz., polyethylene and polypropylene. Bacteria isolated from the samples were screened for the AMR characteristics towards eight different classes of antibiotics. All isolates showed 100% resistance towards colistin and obtained the MAR index value of 0.1–0.4 range. Six representative bacterial isolates with high multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index were selected and identified by 16sRNA sequencing as Lysinibacillus mangiferihumi, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus altitudins and Bacillus pumilus. In vitro biofilm formation was experimented on the purchased plastic samples in artificial media and river water using two selected strains, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus cereus. Significant variations were observed in biofilm growth in different media (P < 0.05) regardless of plastic types (P > 0.05). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the characteristic holes on the surface morphology were visualized in SEM analysis, thus indicating the conditioning of the plastics by the isolates for biofilm formation.","Suresh, Sneha ; Ambily, S.

Regulation Of Args Abundance By Biofilm Colonization On Microplastics Under Selective Pressure Of Antibiotics In River Water Environment.,"Interactions of microplastics (MPs) biofilm with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics in aquatic environments have made microplastic biofilm an issue of keen scholarly interest. The process of biofilm formation and the degree of ARGs enrichment in the presence of antibiotic-selective pressure and the impact on the microbial community need to be further investigated. In this paper, the selective pressure of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and illumination conditions were investigated to affect the physicochemical properties, biomass, and extracellular polymer secretion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic biofilm. In addition, relative copy numbers of nine ARGs were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In the presence of CIP, microorganisms in the water and microplastic biofilm were more inclined to carry associated ARGs (2–3 times higher), which had a contributing effect on ARGs enrichment. The process of pre-microplastic biofilm formation might have an inhibitory effect on ARGs (total relative abundance up to 0.151) transfer and proliferation compared to the surrounding water (total relative abundance up to 0.488). However, in the presence of CIP stress, microplastic biofilm maintained the abundance of ARGs (from 0.151 to 0.149) better compared to the surrounding water (from 0.488 to 0.386). Therefore, microplastic biofilm act as abundance buffer island of ARGs stabilizing the concentration of ARGs. In addition, high-throughput analyses showed the presence of antibiotic-resistant (Pseudomonas) and pathogenic (Vibrio) microorganisms in biofilm under different conditions. The above research deepens our understanding of ARGs enrichment in biofilm and provides important insights into the ecological risks of interactions between ARGs, antibiotics, and microplastic biofilm. [Display omitted] • Characteristics of PVC biofilm formation by different conditions were summarized. • Selective pressure of CIP had enrichment effect on ARGs in water and biofilm. • PVC biofilm created conditions for selective pressure to generate ARGs. • Biofilm maintained the abundance of ARGs better than the surrounding water. • Characterization of bacterial community composition in PVC biofilm was studied.","Zheng, Zhijie ; Wang, Xiaolong ; Zhang, Wenzhu ; Wang, Lan ; Lyu, Honghong ; Tang, Jingchun",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120402,Journal Of Environmental Management
Plastic Wastes And Surface Antibiotic Resistance Genes Pollution In Mangrove Environments.,"Mangroves are located at the intersection of land and sea and are also heavily affected by plastic wastes. Biofilms of plastic wastes in mangroves are reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, plastic wastes and ARG pollution were investigated from three typical mangrove areas in Zhanjiang, South China. Transparent was the dominant colors of plastic wastes in three mangroves. Fragment and film shape accounted for 57.73–88.23% of plastic waste samples in mangroves. In addition, 39.50% of plastic wastes in protected area mangroves are PS. The metagenomic results shows that the 175 ARGs were found on plastic wastes of the three mangroves, the abundance accounting for 91.11% of the total ARGs. The abundance of Vibrio accounted for 2.31% of the total bacteria genera in aquaculture pond area mangrove. Correlation analysis shows that a microbe can carry multiple ARGs that may improve resistance to antibiotics. Microbes are the potential hosts of most ARGs, suggesting that ARGs can be transmitted by microbes. Because the mangroves are closely related to human activities and the high abundance of ARGs on plastic increases the ecological risks, people should improve plastic waste management and prevent the spread of ARGs by reducing plastic pollution.","Sun, Ruikun ; Liu, Yu ; Li, Ting ; Qian, Zhong-Ji ; Zhou, Chunxia ; Hong, Pengzhi ; Sun, Shengli ; Li, Chengyong",10.1007/s10661-023-11312-8,Environmental Monitoring & Assessment
Incomplete Degradation Of Aromatic–Aliphatic Copolymer Leads To Proliferation Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes.,"[Display omitted] • Microplastics are released and accumulated during uncontrolled composting of biodegradable plastics. • Aromatic − aliphatic plastics serve as vectors and hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes. • The degradation of biodegradable plastics in compost needs to be enhanced to maintain compost quality. Biodegradable plastics (BDPs) have attracted extensive attention as an alternative to conventional plastics. BDPs could be mineralized by composting, while the quality of compost affected by the presence of BDPs and the residual microplastics (MPs) has not been well evaluated. This study aimed to explore the MPs release potential and environmental implications of commercial BDPs (aromatic−aliphatic copolymer) films in uncontrolled composting. Results showed that the molecular weight of BDPs decreased by >60% within 60 d. However, the non-extracted organic matter and wet-sieving measurements indicated that MPs continuously released and accumulated during regular composting. The average MPs release potential (0.1–5 mm) was 134.6 ± 18.1 particles/mg (BDPs), which resulted in 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> particles/g dw in compost. The plastisphere of MPs showed a significantly higher (0.95–16.76 times) abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which resulted in the rising (1.34–2.24 times) of ARGs in compost heaps, in comparison to the control groups. Overall, BDPs promote the spread of ARGs through the selective enrichment of bacteria and horizontal transfer from released MPs. These findings confirmed that BDPs could enhance the release potential of MPs and the dissemination of ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding and environmental risk of BDPs.","Zhang, Yuchen ; Tao, Jianping ; Bai, Yudan ; Wang, Feng ; Xie, Bing",10.1016/j.envint.2023.108291,Environment International
Shallow Shotgun Sequencing Of Healthcare Waste Reveals Plastic-Eating Bacteria With Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Resistance Genes.,"The burgeoning crises of antimicrobial resistance and plastic pollution are converging in healthcare settings, presenting a complex challenge to global health. This study investigates the microbial populations in healthcare waste to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance and the potential for plastic degradation by bacteria. Our metagenomic analysis, using both amplicon and shallow shotgun sequencing, provided a comprehensive view of the taxonomic diversity and functional capacity of the microbial consortia. The viable bacteria in healthcare waste samples were analyzed employing full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, revealing a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Notably, Proteus mirabilis VFC3/3 and Pseudomonas sp. VFA2/3 were detected, while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VFV3/2 surfaced as the predominant species, holding implications for the spread of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multidrug-resistant strains conferring antimicrobial genes, including the broad-spectrum antibiotic carbapenem, underscoring the critical need for improved waste management and infection control measures. Remarkably, we found genes linked to the breakdown of plastic that encoded for enzymes of the esterase, depolymerase, and oxidoreductase classes. This suggests that specific bacteria found in medical waste may be able to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that comes from biological and medical waste. The information is helpful in formulating strategies to counter the combined problems of environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring microbial communities in hospital waste in order to influence waste management procedures and public health policy. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance and plastic waste, especially in hospital settings where they intersect most acutely. [Display omitted] • P. mirabilis , S. maltophilia , and Pseudomonas sp. isolated from HCW. • Antibiotic susceptibility testing confirmed all three multidrug-resistant strains. • Shallow shotgun sequencing found plastic-degrading genes in microbial populations. • Esterase-, depolymerase-, and oxidoreductase-class enzymes are found in HCW. • P. mirabilis and S. maltophilia are predicted as potential plastic degraders.","Siew, Shing Wei ; Khairi, Mohamad Hazwan Fikri ; Hamid, Norhisham Abdul ; Asras, Mohd Fazli Farida ; Ahmad, Hajar Fauzan",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125330,Environmental Pollution
Plastics In The Marine Environment Are Reservoirs For Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes.,"Abstract Plastics have been accumulated offshore and in the deep oceans at an unprecedented scale. Microbial communities have colonized the plastisphere, which has become a reservoir for both antibiotic and metal resistance genes (ARGs and MRGs). This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence of ARGs and MRGs, and their relationships within the microbial community, using metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database. The abundance of ARGs and MRGs in microbial communities on the plastics were in the ranges 7.07 × 10<sup>−4</sup>–1.21 × 10<sup>−2</sup> and 5.51 × 10<sup>−3</sup>–4.82 × 10<sup>−2</sup> copies per 16S rRNA, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of ARGs and MRGs in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of ARGs and MRGs in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant differences in the abundance or diversity of ARGs and MRGs between macroplastics biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition was the determining factor of the ARG profile but not for MRG. Some ARGs and MRGs had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • Plastic size does not influence the abundance and diversity of resistance genes. • Metal resistance genes had higher abundances than antibiotic resistance genes. • Plastics are a reservoir for metal resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes. • Bacterial community driving ARG composition but not for MRG profile • Flavobacteriaceae family bacteria are potential host for ARGs and MRGs.","Yang, Yuyi ; Liu, Guihua ; Song, Wenjuan ; Ye, Chen ; Lin, Hui ; Li, Zan ; Liu, Wenzhi",10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.061,Environment International
Exposure To Bisphenol Compounds Accelerates The Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmid.,"Antimicrobial resistance poses the most formidable challenge to public health, with plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer playing a pivotal role in its global spread. Bisphenol compounds (BPs), a group of environmental contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties, are extensively used in various plastic products and can be transmitted to food. However, the impact of BPs on the plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not yet been elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate that BPs could promote the conjugative transfer frequency of RP4-7 and clinically multidrug-resistant plasmids. Furthermore, the promoting effect of BPs on the plasmid transfer was also confirmed in a murine model. Microbial diversity analysis of transconjugants indicated an increase in α diversity in the BPAF-treated group, along with the declined richness of some beneficial bacteria and elevated richness of Faecalibaculum rodentium , which might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. The underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced conjugative transfer upon BPAF treatment include exacerbated oxidative stress, disrupted membrane homeostasis, augmented energy metabolism, and the increased expression of conjugation-related genes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential risk associated with the exacerbated dissemination of AMR both in vitro and in vivo caused by BPs exposure. • BPs promote the conjugative transfer of resistance plasmids. • BPs enhance the spread of ARGs in a murine model. • Faecalibaculum rodentium might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. • BPs exacerbate oxidative stress, disrupt membrane homeostasis and augment energy metabolism.","Yang, Bingqing ; Sun, Jingyi ; Zhu, Shuyao ; Wang, Zhiqiang ; Liu, Yuan",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120002,Environmental Research
Plastisphere In A Low-Pollution Mountain River: Influence Of Microplastics On Survival Of Pathogenic Bacteria.,"Microplastics (MPs) are found even in remote and low-pollution freshwater ecosystems. However, the microbial communities associated with MPs in these environments remain poorly understood. We characterized the plastisphere in a low-pollution riverine ecosystem and evaluated the influence of different MPs in the persistence of pathogens in such environments. A mixture of MPs (MPs Mix) composed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was submerged at three locations (L1, L2 and L3) in the river. For comparison purposes, water and sand communities were also analyzed. Our results revealed distinct bacterial communities on MPs compared to those in water or on the natural substrate (sand). However, the resemblance between the plastisphere and communities on natural particles was higher than what has been reported for polluted ecosystems. Although pathogens were predominantly enriched in the water, a few genera (e.g. Acinetobacter , Legionella and Mycobacterium) were enriched in the plastisphere. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes did not differ significantly between water, sand, and MPs. The influence of different MPs (PE, PP, PET) on the persistence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (i.e. cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli and meropenem-resistant Enterobacter kobei) in unpolluted water was assessed in microcosms. Significant differences were observed between the microcosms with MPs and those with natural particles (sand), after a 36-day exposure. A significantly higher persistence of the pathogens was registered in microcosms with PE and PET. Our results provide new insights into the plastisphere in non-pollution environments and demonstrate that even in these settings, MPs can facilitate the survival and dissemination of pathogens. [Display omitted] • MPs host unique microbial communities in low-pollution rivers. • Plastisphere and sand communities were more similar than in polluted rivers. • Lower microbial risk associated to MPs in low-pollution rivers. • MPs boost antibiotic-resistant pathogens persistence in river water. • Plastic polymer type influences pathogens persistence in river water.","Silva, Isabel ; Rodrigues, Elsa T. ; Tacão, Marta ; Henriques, Isabel",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143800,Chemosphere
Microplastics Enrichment Characteristics Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens In Landfill Leachate.,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a pressing environmental issue for aquatic ecosystems. Landfill leachate is an important contributor of MPs and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). However, there are few studies on the colonization of ARGs and pathogens on MPs in leachate. This study conducted incubation experiments with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) MPs in landfill leachate which were about 3–5 years old (PL) and 5–10 years old (AL). After incubation, the bacterial cells colonized and grew on the surface of MPs, inducing the increase of oxygenated oxygen functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) on the MPs surface. Real-time PCR indicated that MPs selectively enriched ARGs, such as genes tetM , tetC , mcr-1 , aac(6′)-Ib-cr , blaTEM and blaSHV in leachate. The diversity of bacterial communities on MPs was significantly increased in AL leachate, but decreased in PL leachate. The differences in bacterial communities in MPs biofilms were related to the type of MPs. Compared with AL leachate, the abundance of Chloroflexi increased by 15.7% on the PET, and the abundance of Acidobacteriota increased by 6.23 fold on the PP. The abundance of Firmicutes increased from 20.7% in PL leachate to 65.8% and 60.7% on PET and PP, respectively. Additionally, pathogens were observed to be more abundant on MPs compared to leachate. In particular, pathogens (Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Enterobacter and Rhodococcus) associated with sul1 and sul2 were generally present at higher levels on MPs than in the surrounding leachate. These results provide significant implications for understanding the health risk of MPs in the environment. [Display omitted] • MPs surface possessed more oxygen-containing functional groups in leachate. • ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs and had a high horizontal transfer ability. • MPs surface had a specific microbial community in different leachates. • MPs enriched pathogens in leachates. • Pathogens on MPs were closely associated with ARGs.","Qiu, Cheng ; Zhou, Yiwei ; Wang, Hua ; Chu, Yixuan ; Zheng, Lei ; Chen, Yongmin ; Song, Yali ; Fang, Chengran",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140100,Chemosphere
Beach Sand Plastispheres Are Hotspots For Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potentially Pathogenic Bacteria Even In Beaches With Good Water Quality.,"Massive amounts of microplastics are transported daily from the oceans and rivers onto beaches. The ocean plastisphere is a hotspot and a vector for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the plastisphere in beach sand. Thus, to describe whether the microplastics from beach sand represent a risk to human health, we evaluated the bacteriome and abundance of ARGs on microplastic and sand sampled at the drift line and supralittoral zones of four beaches of poor and good water quality. The bacteriome was evaluated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, and the ARGs and bacterial abundances were evaluated by high-throughput real-time PCR. The results revealed that the microplastic harbored a bacterial community that is more abundant and distinct from that of beach sand, as well as a greater abundance of potential human and marine pathogens, especially the microplastics deposited closer to seawater. Microplastics also harbored a greater number and abundance of ARGs. All antibiotic classes evaluated were found in the microplastic samples, but not in the beach sand ones. Additionally, 16 ARGs were found on the microplastic alone, including genes related to multidrug resistance (blaKPC , blaCTX-M , tetM , mdtE and acrB_1) , genes that have the potential to rapidly and horizontally spread (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, and tetM), and the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics that are typically regarded as the ultimate line of defense against severe multi-resistant bacterial infections (blaKPC). Lastly, microplastic harbored a similar bacterial community and ARGs regardless of beach water quality. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of microplastics in beach sand worldwide may constitute a potential threat to human health, even in beaches where the water quality is deemed satisfactory. This phenomenon may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs. [Display omitted] • ARGs are more prevalent and abundant on microplastics than in beach sand. • Genes related to multidrug resistance were found exclusively on the microplastic. • Beach microplastics may harbor blaKPC, the gene for last-resort antibiotic resistance. • Microplastics in sand may pose health risks, regardless of water quality of the beach. • Microplastic deposited closer to seawater appears to pose a greater health risk.","Magalhães, Emily Amorim ; De Jesus, Hugo Emiliano ; Pereira, Pedro Henrique Freitas ; Gomes, Abílio Soares ; Santos, Henrique Fragoso Dos",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.123237,Environmental Pollution
Entry Pathways Determined The Effects Of Mps On Sludge Anaerobic Digestion System: The Views Of Methane Production And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Fates.,"Sludge is one of the primary reservoirs of microplastics (MPs), and the effects of MPs on subsequent sludge treatment raised attention. Given the entry pathways, MPs would exhibit different properties, but the entry pathway-dependent effect of MPs on sludge treatment performance and the fates of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), another high-risk emerging contaminant, were seldom documented. Herein, MPs with two predominant entry pathways, including wastewater-derived (WW-derived) and anaerobic digestion-introduced (AD-introduced), were used to investigate the effects on AD performance and ARGs abundances. The results indicated that WW-derived MPs, namely the MPs accumulated in sludge during the wastewater treatment process, exhibited significant inhibition on methane production by 22.8%–71.6%, while the AD-introduced MPs, being introduced in the sludge AD process, slightly increased the methane yield by 4.7%–17.1%. Meanwhile, MPs were responsible for promoting transmission of target ARGs, and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) showed a greater promotion effect (0.0154–0.0936) than polyamide MPs (PA-MPs) (0.0013–0.0724). Compared to size, entry pathways and types played more vital roles on MPs influences. Investigation on mechanisms based on microbial community structure revealed characteristics (aging degree and types) of MPs determined the differences of AD performance and ARGs fates. WW-derived MPs with longer aging period and higher aging degree would release toxics and decrease the activities of microorganisms, resulting in the negative impact on AD performance. However, AD-introduced MPs with short aging period exhibited marginal impacts on AD performance. Furthermore, the co-occurrent network analysis suggested that the variations of potential host bacteria induced by MPs with different types and aging degree attributed to the dissemination of ARGs. Distinctively from most previous studies, the MPs with different sizes did not show remarkable effects on AD performance and ARGs fates. Our findings benefited the understanding of realistic environmental behavior and effect of MPs with different sources. [Display omitted] • WW-derived microplastics inhibited methane yield while AD-introduced showed reverse impacts. • WW-derived microplastics increased abundances of antibiotics resistance genes than AD-introduced microplastics. • Microbial activity was severe inhibited by WW-derived microplastics. • Impacts on anaerobic digestion performance and antibiotics resistance genes fate were determined by types and entry pathways.","Wang, Xueting ; Huang, Guangchen ; Chen, Qirui ; Pang, Ruirui ; Han, Zhibang ; Zhu, Jundong ; Xie, Bing ; Su, Yinglong ; Zhou, Shuai",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119061,Environmental Research
New Insight Into The Effect Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance And Bacterial Community Of Biofilm.,"Microplastics (MPs) could serve as substrates for microbial colonization and biofilm formation. However, research on the effects of different types of microplastics and natural substrates on biofilm formation and community structure in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) is limited. In this study, we employed by means of microcosm experiments to analyze the situation of biofilms conditions, bacterial resistance patterns, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) distribution, and bacterial community on different substrates using microbial cultivation, high throughtput sequencing and PCR. The result showed that biofilms on different substrates markedly increased with time, with MPs surfaces formed more biofilm than stone. Analyses of antibiotic resistant showed negligible differences in the resistance rate to the same antibiotic at 30 d, but tet B would be selectively enriched on PP and PET. The microbial communities associated with biofilms on MPs and stones exhibited variations during different stages of formation. Notably, phylum WPS-2 and Epsilonbacteraeota were identified as the dominant microbiomes of biofilms on MPs and stones at 30 d, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that WPS-2 could potentially be a tetracycline-resistant bacterium, while Epsilonbacteraeota did not correlate with any detected ARB. Our results emphasized the potential threat posed by MPs as attachment carriers for bacteria, particularly ARB, in aquatic environments. [Display omitted] • MPs and stone will selectively enrich specific ARGs. • Distinct bacterial community structure was observed on MPs and stone. • WPS-2 is the dominant bacteria and potential tetracycline-resistant bacteria on PP and PET. • The microorganisms are more suitable to colonize on MPs surface.","Li, Yong-Qiang ; Zhang, Chong-Miao ; Yuan, Qiao-Qiao ; Wu, Kai",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139151,Chemosphere
Metagenomic Insight Into The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Activated Sludge Upon Exposure To Nanoplastics.,"Activated sludge is an important reservoir for the co-occurring emerging contaminants including nanoplastics (NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the impacts and potential mechanisms of NPs on the fate of ARGs in activated sludge are not fully understood. Herein, we used metagenomic approach to investigate the responses of ARGs, host bacteria, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and functional genes to polystyrene (PS) NPs at environmentally relevant (0.5 mg/L) and high stress concentrations (50 mg/L) in activated sludge. The results showed that 0.5 and 50 mg/L PS NPs increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the activated sludge by 58.68% and 46.52%, respectively (p < 0.05). Host tracking analysis elucidated that the hosts of ARGs were significantly enriched by PS NPs (p < 0.05), with Proteobacteria being the predominant host bacteria. Additionally, the occurrence of new ARGs hosts and the enrichment of MGEs and functional genes (i.e., genes related to SOS response, cell membrane permeability, and secretion system, etc.) indicated that PS NPs promoted horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. Finally, path modeling analysis revealed that the proliferation of ARGs caused by PS NPs was primarily attributed to the enhancement of HGT and the enrichment of host bacteria. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the spread risk of ARGs in activated sludge under NPs pollution. [Display omitted] • First metagenomic insight into the effect of PS NPs on ARGs fate in sludge was reported. • Environmental concentration of PS NPs notably improved the abundance of ARGs in sludge. • Host bacteria of ARGs, especially Proteobacteria , were remarkably enriched by PS NPs. • The proliferation of ARGs under PS NPs stress mainly depended on the host bacteria and HGT.","Song, Jian ; Huang, Zefeng ; Gao, Yuanyuan ; Wang, Weigang ; Guo, Gang ; Duan, Yi ; Zhou, Shuai ; Tang, Zhenping",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125260,Environmental Pollution
Co-Occurence Of Antibiotics And Micro(Nano)Plastics: A Systematic Review Between 2016-2021.,"Pollution by plastics and antibiotics are emerging issues in the areas of the environment and human health. In recent years, several studies have documented the widespread occurrence of plastic particles in various environmental, as well as human, systems, and much research has focused on possible interactions of contaminants with microplastics. Thus, the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics has caused another global problem for the environment and human health. Therefore, we focused on the current knowledge in the field of the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics to summarize the available studies. In this review, categorization of the topics, contaminants details, such as polymer type, size and source, antibiotic type, and other experimental parameters were summarized and discussed. This study indicated that the sorption of antibiotics on plastics, antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of plastics, and antibiotic resistance gene onto plastics were the most frequently examined categories in this field. Moreover, the variability in the procedures and the processes, and the heterogeneity data of reporting between different studies on similar topic make it difficult to bring all results together and produce a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that further research should be done using this systematic study.","Baysal, Asli ; Saygin, Hasan",10.1080/10934529.2022.2082222,Journal Of Environmental Science & Health.

Investigating The Impact Of Nanoplastics In Altering The Efficacy Of Clarithromycin Antibiotics Through In Vitro Studies.,"Plastics have significant global implications due to their environmental contamination from extensive use and improper disposal. Among plastic particles, nanoplastics (<1 μm) pose notable risks to organisms and ecosystems due to their high surface area, reactivity, and potential to carry environmental pollutants. This study explores the interaction between polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and clarithromycin (CLA), a broad-spectrum antibiotic, focusing on their combined impact on insulin (INS) and antibiotic-resistant (AMR) bacteria. PSNPs can adsorb CLA, leading to structural changes in insulin and affecting its physiological functions, potentially causing insulin resistance. Additionally, PSNPs reduce CLA's inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria, facilitating antibiotic resistance. Our research utilized UV–Vis Spectroscopy, FTIR, Fluorescence spectroscopy, and Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to assess INS structural changes, alongside the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for microbiological examination. The findings highlight the synergistic and antagonistic effects of PSNPs and CLA, underscoring the enhanced toxicity of CLA when adsorbed onto PSNPs and the complex interactions affecting both human health and bacterial resistance.

Potential Risks Of Microplastics Combined With Superbugs: Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria On The Surface Of Microplastics In Mariculture System.,"Microplastics have become emerging pollutants and served as potential vectors for harmful bacteria, while rare information on the emergency and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on the surface of microplastics is available. This study investigated the enrichment of ARB, especially multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria (MARB), on the surface of microplastics in mariculture system. Polyethylene terephthalate accounted for the highest proportion (75%) in the collected microplastics. The counts of cultivable ARB in microplastic samples were 6.40 × 10<sup>6</sup>–2.48 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/g, which were 100–5000 times higher than those in water samples. The ratios of cultivable ARB to total cultivable bacteria from microplastic samples were higher than those from water samples. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and abundance of cultivable ARB in the microplastic samples was high with the predominant bacterial genera of Vibrio, Muricauda and Ruegeria. Total 160 MARB isolates were obtained and most of isolates were obtained from the microplastic samples. MARB isolates resisting or intermediating to four and three antibiotics accounted for much higher proportions in the microplastic samples, and the higher percentage of antibiotic resistance was to penicillin, sulfafurazole, erythromycin and tetracycline. The dominant multiple antibiotic resistance profile was TET-SFX-ERY-PEN, which accounted for 25.4% in microplastic samples and 23.9% in water samples. In typical MARB isolates, the positive detection rate of ARGs was up to 80.0% in microplastic samples while that was 65.3% in water samples. Five types of class 1 integrons (intI 1) associated gene cassette arrays and seven types of gene cassettes were detected in microplastic samples, which were more than those in water samples. These results revealed that microplastics were hazardous pollutants for the enrichment of ARB, especially superbugs, and the spread of antibiotic resistance. Image 1 • ARB counts on microplastics were 100–5000 times higher than those in water. • Ratios of ARB to total bacteria from microplastics were higher than those from water. • Multi-drug resistance of TET-SFX-ERY-PEN accounted for 25% on microplastics. • ARGs detection rate was up to 80% on microplastics while that was 65% in water. • Microplastics were hazardous pollutants for the enrichment of superbugs.","Zhang, Yuxuan ; Lu, Jian ; Wu, Jun ; Wang, Jianhua ; Luo, Yongming",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109852,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
Tracking Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic-Contaminated Soil.,"Agricultural soils and microplastics (MPs) are hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Plastic mulch is the most important source of MPs in agricultural soil. ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and their host profiles in long-term mulch MP-exposed soils remain unclear. In the present study, metagenomics was used to investigate the distribution patterns of ARGs and MGEs in eight Chinese provinces with a long history of plastic mulch use. A total of 204 subtypes of ARGs and thousands of MGEs (14 integrons, 28 insertions, and 2993 plasmids) were identified. A similar diversity of ARGs was found among MPs film-contaminated sites. The types of ARGs with a high abundance were more concentrated, and multidrug resistance genes were the dominant ARGs. Soils from regions with a longer history of plastic film use (such as Xinjiang province) had a higher abundance of ARGs and MGEs. The distribution of ARGs and MGEs exhibited a modular network distribution pattern. A total of 27 ARG subtypes and 29 MGEs showed co-occurrence network relationships. More than 10 common hosts of ARGs and MGEs, such as Pseudomonas , were found, and their abundances were highest in three provinces, including Xinjiang. This study may help elucidate the impact mechanism of long-term MP residues on the occurrence and spread of ARGs in soil. [Display omitted] • Similar microbial communities and diversity of ARGs were found among MPs contaminated sites. • Multidrug resistance genes were the dominant ARGs. • Strong co-occurrence between ARGs and MGEs was observed.","Wu, Changcai ; Song, Xianpeng ; Wang, Dan ; Ma, Yajie ; Ren, Xiangliang ; Hu, Hongyan ; Shan, Yongpan ; Ma, Xiaoyan ; Cui, Jinjie ; Ma, Yan",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137235,Chemosphere
Watershed Urbanization Enhances The Enrichment Of Pathogenic Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In The Water Environment.,"Microplastics (MPs) serve as vectors for microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and contribute to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs across various environments. Patterns of microbial communities and ARGs in the biofilm on the surface of MPs, also termed as plastisphere, have become an issue of global concern. Although antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere has been detected, how watershed urbanization affects patterns of potential pathogens and ARGs in the microplastic biofilms is still unclear. Here, we compared the bacterial communities, the interaction between bacterial taxa, pathogenic bacteria, and ARGs between the plastisphere and their surrounding water, and revealed the extensive influence of urbanization on them. Our results showed that bacterial communities and interactions in the plastisphere differed from those in their surrounding water. Microplastics selectively enriched Bacteroidetes from water. In non-urbanized area, the abundance of Oxyphotobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than that in water, while α-Proteobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than those in water of urbanized area. Pathogenic bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urbanized area than those in non-urbanized area. MPs selectively enriched ARG-carrying potential pathogens, i.e. , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae , and exhibited a distinct effect on the relative abundance of ARG and pathogens in water with different urbanization levels. We further found ARGs were significantly correlated to MGEs and pathogenic bacteria. These results suggested that MPs would promote the dissemination of ARGs among microbes including pathogenic bacteria, and urbanization would affect the impact of MPs on microbes, pathogens, and ARGs in water. A high level of urbanization could enhance the enrichment of pathogens and ARGs by MPs in aquatic systems and increase microbial risk in aquatic environments. Our findings highlighted the necessity of controlling the spread of ARGs among pathogens and the usage of plastic products in ecosystems of urban areas.

Effects Comparison Between The Secondary Nanoplastics Released From Biodegradable And Conventional Plastics On The Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Between Bacteria.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have caused widespread concern because of their potential harm to environmental safety and human health. As substitutes for conventional plastics, the toxic effects of short-term degradation products of biodegradable plastics (polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)) on bacteria and their impact on ARGs transfer were the focus of this study. After 60 days of degradation, more secondary nanoplastics were released from the biodegradable plastics PLA and PHA than that from the conventional plastics polystyrene (PS). All kinds of nanoplastics, no matter released from biodegradable plastics or conventional plastics, had no significant toxicity to bacteria. Nanoplastic particles from biodegradable plastics could significantly increase the transfer efficiency of ARGs. Although the amount of secondary nanoplastics produced by PHA microplastics was much higher than that of PLA, the transfer frequency after exposure to PLA was much higher, which may be due to the agglomeration of PHA nanoplastics caused by plastic instability in solution. After exposure to the 60 d PLA nanoplastics, the transfer frequency was the highest, which was approximately 28 times higher than that of control. The biodegradable nanoplastics significantly enhanced the expression of the outer membrane pore protein genes omp A and omp C, which could increase cell membrane permeability. The expression levels of trf Ap and trb Bp were increased by repressed major global regulatory genes kor A, kor B, and trb A, which eventually led to an increase in conjugative transfer frequency. This study provides important insights into the evaluation of the environmental and health risks caused by secondary nanoplastics released from biodegradable plastics. [Display omitted] • After 60 d degradation, secondary nanoplastics had no significant toxicity to bacteria. • Biodegradable nanoplastics could promote the transfer of ARGs between bacteria. • PS nanoplastics had no significant effect on the transfer of ARGs between bacteria. • The short-term biological effect of biodegradable plastics could not be neglected.","Liu, Xiaomei ; Wang, Xiaolong ; Wang, Renjun ; Guo, Saisai ; Ahmad, Shakeel ; Song, Yuhao ; Gao, Peike ; Chen, Junfeng ; Liu, Chunchen ; Ding, Ning",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120680,Environmental Pollution
The Resistance Change And Stress Response Mechanisms Of Chlorine-Resistant Bacteria Under Microplastic Stress In Drinking Water Distribution System.,"The presence of both chlorine-resistant bacteria (CRB) and microplastics (MPs) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) poses a threat to water quality and human health. However, the risk of CRB bio evolution under the stress of MPs remains unclear. In this study, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were selected to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and it was clear that MPs had the risk of carrying pollutants into DWDS and releasing them. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility test and disinfection experiment confirmed that MPs could enhance the resistance of CRB to antibiotics and disinfectants. Bacteria epigenetic resistance mechanisms were approached from multiple perspectives, including physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as molecular regulatory networks. When MPs enter DWDS, CRB could attach to the surface of MPs and directly interact with both MPs and the antibiotics they release. This attachment process promoted changes in the composition and content of extracellular polymers (EPS) within cells, enhanced surface hydrophobicity, stimulated oxidative stress function, and notably elevated the relative abundance of certain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study elucidates the mechanism by which MPs alter the intrinsic properties of CRB, providing valuable insights into the effective avoidance of biological risks to water quality during CRB evolution. [Display omitted] • Chlorine disinfection was deteriorated by the presence of MPs. • MPs contributed to the upregulation of multi-antibiotic resistance genes in CRB. • Oxidative stress response was triggered by MPs.","Zhang, Jingna ; Ma, Wencheng ; Li, Yibing ; Zhong, Dan ; Zhou, Ziyi ; Ma, Jun",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124331,Environmental Pollution
Impact Of Polystyrene Nanoplastics On Primary Sludge Fermentation Under Acidic And Alkaline Conditions: Significance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes.,"As a part of industrial or commercial discharge, the influx of nanoplastics (NPs) to the wastewater treatment plants is inevitable. Consequently, it has become a must to understand the effects of these NPs on different unit processes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of three different concentrations of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) on the fermentation of primary sludge (PrS), implemented in batch anaerobic bioreactors, at pH 5 and 10, considering the pH-dependent nature of the fermentation process. The results showed that PsNPs stimulated hydrogen gas production at a lower dose (50 μg/L), while a significant gas suppression was denoted at higher concentrations (150 μg/L, 250 μg/L). In both acidic and alkaline conditions, propionic and acetic acid predominated, respectively, followed by n-butyric acid. Under both acidic and alkaline conditions, exposure to PsNPs boosted the propagation of various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including tetracycline, macrolide, β-lactam and sulfonamide resistance genes, and integrons. Notably, under alkaline condition, the abundance of sul 2 gene in the 250 μg PsNPs/L batch exhibited a 2.4-fold decrease compared to the control batch. The response of the microbial community to PsNPs exposure exhibited variations at different pH values. Bacteroidetes prevailed at both pH conditions, with their relative abundance increasing after PsNPs exposure, indicating a positive impact of PsNPs on PrS solubilization. Adverse impacts, however, were detected in Firmicutes , Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria. The observed variations in the survival rates of various microbes stipulate that they do not have the same tolerance levels under different pH conditions. [Display omitted] • PsNPs exposure up to 250 μg/L did not hinder VFA production in sludge fermentation. • Composition of VFAs varied by different pH levels rather than PsNPs levels. • PsNPs enhanced the proliferation of most antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). • Dominant ARGs varied by different pH levels.","Saila, Romana ; Zakaria, Basem S. ; Mirsoleimani Azizi, Seyed Mohammad ; Mostafa, Alsayed ; Dhar, Bipro Ranjan",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142777,Chemosphere
Are Microplastic Particles A Hotspot For The Spread And The Persistence Of Antibiotic Resistance In Aquatic Systems?,"In the last decade, the study of the origin and fate of plastic debris received great attention, leading to a new and broad awareness of the hazard represented by these particles for the environment and the biota. At the same time, the scientific consideration on the leading role of the environment regarding the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) increased. Both, microplastic particles (MPs) and ARB share pollution sources and, in aquatic systems, MPs could act as a novel ecological niche, favouring the survival of pathogens and ARB. MPs can host a specific microbial biofilm, referred to as plastisphere , phylogenetically different from the surrounding planktonic microbial community and from the biofilm growing on other suspended particles. The plastisphere can influence the overall microbiome of a specific habitat, by introducing and supporting different species and by increasing horizontal gene transfer. In this review we collect and analyse the available studies coupling MPs and antibiotic resistance in water, highlighting knowledge gaps to be filled in order to understand if MPs could effectively act as a carrier of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes, and pose a real threat to human health. [Display omitted] • Plastisphere accumulates antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria. • Sulfonamide resistant genes are commonly found on MPs. • MPs persist in the aquatic environment favouring the spread of resistances. • Methodological advances are needed to finely characterize the plastisphere resistome. • Plastisphere resistome in freshwater and sediment is still largely unexplored. Microplastic particles (MPs) could represent another carrier of antibiotic resistant bacteria in aquatic environments potentially affecting the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Sathicq, María Belén ; Sabatino, Raffaella ; Corno, Gianluca ; Di Cesare, Andrea",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116896,Environmental Pollution
Long-Term Application Of Organic Fertilizer Prompting The Dispersal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Their Health Risks In The Soil Plastisphere.,"[Display omitted] • Plastisphere amplified ARGs and VFGs caused by long-term organic fertilization. • Co-contig revealed that plastisphere increased the risk of horizontal gene transfer. • Plastisphere tended to promote deterministic process in community assembly of HBPs. Microplastic (MP) pollution is a rapidly growing global environmental concern that has led to the emergence of a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere, which is a hotspot for the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs). However, studies on the effects of long-term organic fertilizer application on the dispersal of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the plastisphere of farmland soil have been limited. Here, we performed a field culture experiment by burying nylon bags filled with MPs in paddy soil that had been treated with different fertilizers for over 30 years to explore the changes of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastisphere. Our results show that the soil plastisphere amplified the ARG and VFG pollution caused by organic fertilization by 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively. And it also led to a 2.7-fold increase in the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Meanwhile, the plastisphere tended to promote deterministic process in the community assembly of HBPs, with an increase of 1.4 times. Network analysis found a significant correlation between ARGs, VFGs, and bacteria in plastisphere. Correlation analysis highlight the important role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in shaping the abundance of ARGs and VFGs, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the health risk associated with the soil plastisphere due ARGs and VFGs derived from organic fertilizers.","Lin, Da ; Xu, Jia-Yang ; Wang, Lu ; Du, Shuai ; Zhu, Dong",10.1016/j.envint.2024.108431,Environment International
Microplastic-Associated Pathogens And Antimicrobial Resistance In Environment.,"The ubiquitous use of microplastics and their release into the environment especially the water bodies by anthropogenic/industrial activities are the major resources for microplastic contamination. The widespread and often injudicious use of antimicrobial drugs or antibiotics in various sectors including human health and hygiene, agriculture, animal husbandry and food industries are leading to the release of antibiotics into the wastewater/sewage and other water bodies, particularly in urban setups and thus leads to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the microbes. Microplastics are emerging as the hubs as well as effective carriers of these microbial pathogens beside their AMR-genes (ARGs) in marine, freshwater, sewage/wastewater, and urban river ecosystems. These drug resistant bacteria interact with microplastics forming synthetic plastispheres, the ideal niche for biofilm formations which in turn facilitates the transfer of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer and further escalates the occurrence and levels of AMR.

Microplastic Biodegradability Dependent Responses Of Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistance To Simulated Freshwater-Seawater Shift In Onshore Marine Aquaculture Zones.,"MPs carrying ARGs can travel between freshwater and seawater due to intensive land-sea interaction in onshore marine aquaculture zones (OMAZ). However, the response of ARGs in plastisphere with different biodegradability to freshwater-seawater shift is still unknown. In this study, ARG dynamics and associated microbiota on biodegradable poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were investigated through a simulated freshwater-seawater shift. The results exhibited that freshwater-seawater shift significantly influenced ARG abundance in plastisphere. The relative abundance of most studied ARGs decreased rapidly in plastisphere after they entered seawater from freshwater but increased on PBAT after MPs entered freshwater from seawater. Besides, the high relative abundance of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes occurred in plastisphere, and the co-change between most ARGs and mobile genetic elements indicated the role of horizontal gene transfer on ARG regulation. Proteobacteria was dominant phylum in plastisphere and the dominant genera, such as Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium , Afipia , Gemmobacter and Enhydrobacter , were significantly associated with qnr S, tet and MDR genes in plastisphere. Moreover, after MPs entered new water environment, the ARGs and microbiota genera in plastisphere changed significantly and tended to converge with those in receiving water. These results indicated that MP biodegradability and freshwater-seawater interaction influenced potential hosts and distributions of ARGs, of which biodegradable PBAT posed a high risk in ARG dissemination.

Microplastic And Antibiotics In Waters: Interactions And Environmental Risks.,"Antibiotics (ATs) are ubiquitously detected in natural waters worldwide, and their tendency to co-migrate with microplastics (MPs) post-adsorption leads to heightened environmental risk. Research on the adsorption of ATs on MPs and their subsequent effects on the environmental risks is gaining significant attention globally. This adsorption process predominantly occurs through hydrophobic forces, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions and is influenced by various environmental factors. The interaction between MPs and ATs exhibited varying degrees of efficiency across different pH levels and ionic strengths. Furthermore, this paper outlines the environmental risks associated with the co-presence of MPs and ATs in aquatic environments, emphasizing the potential effect of MPs on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and related environmental risks. The potential hazards posed by MPs and ATs in aquatic systems warrant serious consideration. Future research should concentrate on the adsorption of ATs/ARGs on MPs under real environmental conditions, horizontal gene transfer on MPs, as well as biofilm formation and agglomeration behavior on MPs that needs to be emphasized. [Display omitted] • Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics (ATs) coexist in aquatic environments. • MPs and ATs have similar distribution patterns. • MPs selectively enrich antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). • MPs act as carriers and migrate together with ATs and ARGs. • Adsorption affects the horizontal and vertical distribution of MPs-ATs and ARGs.","Guo, Jiayi ; Jin, Xinbai ; Zhou, Yi ; Gao, Bowen ; Li, Yang ; Zhou, Yanbo",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123125,Journal Of Environmental Management
"Effects Of Tidal Action On The Stability Of Microbiota, Antibiotic Resistance Genes, And Microplastics In The Pearl River Estuary, Guangzhou, China.","In this study, the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique was used to explore the microbial diversity and differences in the water environment of the Pearl River Estuary in Nansha District with various land use types such as the aquaculture area, industrial area, tourist area, agricultural plantation, and residential area. At the same time, the quantity, type, abundance, and distribution of two types of emerging environmental pollutants, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs), are explored in the water samples from different functional areas. The results show that the dominant phyla in the five functional regions are Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and the dominant genera are Hydrogenophaga , Synechococcus , Limnohabitans and Polynucleobacter.

Bioplastic Accumulates Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes In Coastal Marine Sediments.,"The oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic debris, and several studies have implicated plastic as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bioplastic is widely regarded as an environmentally friendly replacement to conventional petroleum-based plastic, but the effects of bioplastic pollution on marine environments remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first evidence that bioplastic accumulates antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in marine sediments. Biofilms fouling ceramic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) were investigated by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Four ARG groups were more abundant in PHA: trimethoprim resistance (TMP), multidrug resistance (MDR), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance (MLS), and polymyxin resistance (PMR). One MRG group was more abundant in PHA: multimetal resistance (MMR). The relative abundance of ARGs and MRGs were strongly correlated based on a Mantel test between the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices (R = 0.97, p < 0.05) and a Pearson's analysis (R = 0.96, p < 0.05). ARGs were detected in more than 40% of the 57 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) while MRGs were detected in more than 90% of the MAGs. Further investigation (e.g., culturing, genome sequencing, antibiotic susceptibility testing) revealed that PHA biofilms were colonized by hemolytic Bacillus cereus group bacteria that were resistant to beta-lactams, vancomycin, and bacitracin. Taken together, our findings indicate that bioplastic, like conventional petroleum-based plastic, is a reservoir for resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in coastal marine sediments. • Bioplastic accumulates antibiotic and metal resistance genes in marine sediments • Four ARG groups and one MRG group were more abundant in bioplastic biofilms • Abundance of ARGs and MRGs in bioplastic biofilms significantly correlated • Bioplastic colonized by B. cereus bacteria resistant to three antibiotic classes","Di Cesare, Andrea ; Pinnell, Lee J. ; Brambilla, Diego ; Elli, Giulia ; Sabatino, Raffaella ; Sathicq, María B. ; Corno, Gianluca ; O'Donnell, Colin ; Turner, Jeffrey W.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118161,Environmental Pollution
Microplastics Mediates The Spread Of Antimicrobial Resistance Plasmids Via Modulating Conjugal Gene Expression.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and environmental degradation are existential global public health threats. Linking microplastics (MPs) and AMR is particularly concerning as MPs pollution would have significant ramifications on controlling of AMR; however, the effects of MPs on the spread and genetic mechanisms of AMR bacteria remain unclear. Herein, we performed Simonsen end-point conjugation to investigate the impact of four commonly used MPs on transfer of clinically relevant plasmids. The transfer breadth of a representative pA/C_MCR-8 plasmid across bacterial communities was confirmed by the cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our study shows that exposure to four commonly found MPs promotes the conjugation rates of four clinically relevant AMR plasmids by up to 200-fold, when compared to the non-exposed group and that the transfer rates are MP concentrations demonstrate a positive correlation with higher transfer rates. Furthermore, we show that MPs induce the expression of plasmid-borne conjugal genes and SOS-linked genes such as recA , lexA , dinB and dinD. High-throughput sequencing of the broad transmission of plasmid pA/C_MCR-8, shows distribution over two main phyla, Pseudomonadota (50.0 %-95.0 %) and Bacillota (0.4 %-2.0 %). These findings definitively link two global health emergencies − AMR and environmental degradation via MPs, and to tackle global AMR, we must also now consider plastic utilisation and waste management.","Yang, Qiu E. ; Lin, Zhenyan ; Gan, Dehao ; Li, Minchun ; Liu, Xuedan ; Zhou, Shungui ; Walsh, Timothy R.",10.1016/j.envint.2025.109261,Environment International
Detection Of Faecal Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms Attached To Plastics From Human-Impacted Coastal Areas.,"Plastics have been proposed as vectors of bacteria as they act as a substrate for biofilms. In this study, we evaluated the abundance of faecal and marine bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from biofilms adhered to marine plastics. Floating plastics and plastics from sediments were collected in coastal areas impacted by human faecal pollution in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Culture and/or molecular methods were used to quantify faecal indicators (E. coli , Enterococci and crAssphage), and the ARGs sul I, tet W and bla TEM and the 16S rRNA were detected by qPCR assays. Pseudomonas and Vibrio species and heterotrophic marine bacteria were also analysed via culture-based methods. Results showed that, plastic particles covered by bacterial biofilms, primarily consisted of marine bacteria including Vibrio spp. Some floating plastics had a low concentration of viable E. coli and Enterococci (42% and 67% of the plastics respectively). Considering the median area of the plastics, we detected an average of 68 cfu E. coli per item, while a higher concentration of E. coli was detected on individual plastic items, when compared with 100 ml of the surrounding water. Using qPCR, we quantified higher values of faecal indicators which included inactive and dead microorganisms, detecting up to 2.6 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc mm<sup>−2</sup>. The ARGs were detected in 67–88% of the floating plastics and in 29–57% of the sediment plastics with a concentration of up to 6.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc mm<sup>−2</sup>. Furthermore, enrichment of these genes was observed in biofilms compared with the surrounding water. These results show that floating plastics act as a conduit for both the attachment and transport of faecal microorganisms. In contrast, low presence of faecal indicators was detected in plastic from seafloor sediments. Therefore, although in low concentrations, faecal bacteria, and potential pathogens, were identified in marine plastics, further suggesting plastics act as a reservoir of pathogens and ARGs. [Display omitted] • From 4.9x10⁴ to 8.7x10⁶ 16S rRNA gene gc mm<sup>-2</sup> were detected on plastics. • An average sized plastic item held from 9.1x10¹ to 1.1x10<sup>4</sup> cfu Vibrio spp. • Faecal indicators were detected in plastics in faecally polluted areas. • Higher concentration of E. coli was detected in a single plastic than in the water. • Marine plastics were colonised by faecal bacteria and drifted to cleaner areas. • There was an enrichment of faecal indicators and ARGs in the plastic biofilm.","Liang, Hongxia ; De Haan, William P. ; Cerdà-Domènech, Marc ; Méndez, Javier ; Lucena, Francisco ; García-Aljaro, Cristina ; Sanchez-Vidal, Anna ; Ballesté, Elisenda",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120983,Environmental Pollution
The Stress Response Of Tetracycline Resistance Genes And Bacterial Communities Under The Existence Of Microplastics In Typical Leachate Biological Treatment System.,"Landfill leachate is an important source of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). Here, in the presence of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) and polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs), the nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect and sludge structure performance were affected in an anaerobic–anoxic–aerobic system, a typical biological leachate treatment process. The abundance of tetracycline-resistance genes (tet genes) in biofilms on the two types of MP was significantly higher than that in the leachate and sludge, and the load on PE-MPs was higher than that on PS-MPs because of the porous structure of PE-MPs. Aging of the MPs increased their surface roughness and abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and shaped the profile of ARGs in the MP biofilms. The biofilm biomass and growth rate on the two types of MP increased with the incubation time in the first 30 days, and was affected by environmental factors. Structural equation models and co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that the MPs indirectly affected the spectrum of ARGs by affecting biofilm formation, and, to a lesser extent, had a direct impact on the selective enrichment of ARGs. We discuss the mechanisms of the relationships between MPs and ARGs in the leachate treatment system, which will have guiding significance for future research. Our data on the colonization of microorganisms and tet genes in MPs biofilms provide new evidence concerning the accumulation and transmission of these ARGs, and are important for understanding the mechanisms of MPs in spreading pollution. [Display omitted] • The tet genes was enriched on the MPs biofilm and it boosted in leachate and sludge. • The aging of MPs shaped the profile of ARGs and ARB on MPs biofilm. • MPs reduced the richness and diversity of microbial community in A/A/O. • MPs integrated regulatory environmental factors to assemble ARGs and ARB. • Enhanced biochemical resistance and pathogens aggravated the MPs pollution.","Li, Hong ; Lian, Yiting ; Li, Siyi ; Yang, Mingdi ; Xie, Qiaona ; Qiu, Libo ; Liu, Hongyuan ; Long, Yuyang ; Hu, Lifang ; Fang, Chengran",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121865,Journal Of Environmental Management

In this work, PVC MPs co-impacts on the toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP to aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems and potential mechanisms were investigated. 10 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition did not significantly affect the nitrogen removal, but it definitely changed the microbial community structure and enhanced the propagation and horizontal transfer of antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). 100 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition resulted in a raise of CuO NP toxicity to the AGS system, but reduced the co-toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP and ARGs expression. The co-impacts with different PVC MPs concentration influenced Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, cell membrane integrity, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents and microbial communities in AGS systems, and lead to a change of nitrogen removal. [Display omitted] • 10 mg/L PVC MPs had no significant effect on the nitrogen removal. • 100 mg/L PVC MPs decreased nitrogen removal efficiency under CuO NPs stress. • 100 mg/L PVC MPs mitigated the co-toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP to AGS. • ARGs expression was enhanced by 10 mg/L PVC MPs, but decreased by 100 mg/L PVC MPs.","Li, Yu-Qi ; Zhao, Bai-Hang ; Zhang, Yu-Qing ; Zhang, Xin-Yue ; Chen, Xiao-Tang ; Yang, Hai-Shan",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117151,Environmental Research
Selective Enrichment Of Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Biofilms And Their Potential Hazards In Coral Reef Ecosystems.,"Microplastics become hotspots for bacteria to trigger a series of ecological effects, but few studies have focused on the potential impacts of microplastic biofilms in coral reef ecosystems. Here, we measured the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the seawater and microplastic biofilms. Results showed that microbial biofilms were formed on the surface of microplastics. The alpha diversity of the bacterial community in the microplastic biofilms was lower than that in the seawater, and the bacterial communities were distinct between the two. Further analysis revealed that several bacteria in the microplastic biofilms carried ARGs, and the proportion of which was correlated to the concentration of antibiotics in the seawater. Specifically, Vibrio was positively correlated to sul1 in the microplastic biofilms under higher concentrations of sulfonamides. Pathway analysis reflected significant overrepresentation of human disease related pathways in the bacterial community of microplastic biofilms. These results suggest that the microplastic biofilms could selectively enrich bacteria from the reef environments, causing the development of ARGs under antibiotic driving. This may pose a serious threat to coral reef ecosystems and human health. Our study provides new insights into the ecological impacts of microplastic biofilms in coral reef ecosystems. [Display omitted] • Microplastics could selectively enrich bacteria from seawater in coral reef regions. • Bacteria on microplastics carried ARGs under antibiotic driving. • Microplastics pose a potential threat to coral and human health via pathogens and ARGs.","Zhou, Zhi ; Tang, Jia ; Tang, Kai ; An, Mingxun ; Liu, Zhaoqun ; Wu, Zhongjie ; Cao, Xiaocong ; He, Chunlong",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141309,Chemosphere
Effects Of Triclosan Adsorption On Intestinal Toxicity And Resistance Gene Expression In Xenopus Tropicalis With Different Particle Sizes Of Polystyrene.,"Microplastics (MPs) are commonly found with hydrophobic contaminants in the water column and pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. The effects of polystyrene microplastics of different particle sizes on the accumulation of triclosan in the gut of Xenopus tropicalis , its toxic effects, and the transmission of resistance genes were evaluated. The results showed that co-exposure to polystyrene (PS-MPs) adsorbed with triclosan (TCS) caused the accumulation of triclosan in the intestine with the following accumulation capacity: TCS + 5 µm PS group > TCS group > TCS + 20 µm PS group > TCS + 0.1 µm PS group. All experimental groups showed increased intestinal inflammation and antioxidant enzyme activity after 28 days of exposure to PS-MPs and TCS of different particle sizes. The TCS + 20 µm PS group exhibited the highest upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL- 10, IL -1β). The TCS + 20 µm group showed the highest increase in enzyme activity compared to the control group. PS-MPs and TCS, either alone or together, altered the composition of the intestinal microbial community. In addition, the presence of more antibiotic resistance genes than triclosan resistance genes significantly increased the expression of tetracycline resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes, which may be associated with the development of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. This study refines the aquatic ecotoxicity assessment of TCS adsorbed by MPs and provides informative information for the management and control of microplastics and non-antibiotic bacterial inhibitors.

Alteration Of Microbial Mediated Carbon Cycle And Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Plastisphere Formation In Coastal Area.,"Microorganisms can attach on the surface of microplastics (MPs) through biological fouling process to form a diverse community called the ""plastisphere"", which has attracted extensive attention. Although the microbial structure and composition of biofilm have been studied, the knowledge of its microbial function and ecological risk is still limited. In this study, we investigated how the surface properties of MPs affect the biofilm communities and metabolic features under different environmental conditions, and explored the biofilm enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results showed that the incubation time, habitat and MPs aging state significantly influenced the structure and composition of biofilm microbial communities, and a small amount of pathogens have been found in the MPs-attached biofilm. The microbial carbon utilization capacity of the biofilm in different incubation habitats varies greatly with highest metabolism capacity appear in the river. The utilization efficiency of different carbon sources is polymer > carbohydrate > amino acid > carboxylic acids > amine/amide, which indicates that the biofilm communities have selectivity between different types of carbon sources. More importantly, ARGs were detected in all the MPs samples and showed a trend of estuary > river > marine. The aged MPs can accumulate more ARGs than the virgin items. In general, MPs in the aquatic environment may become a carrier for pathogens and ARGs to spread to other environment, which may enhance their potential risks to the ecosystem and human health.

Microplastics Pollution In The Ocean: Potential Carrier Of Resistant Bacteria And Resistance Genes.,"Microplastics pollution in marine environments is concerning. Microplastics persist and accumulate in various sections of the ocean where they present opportunity for micropollutant accumulation and microbial colonisation. Even though biofilm formation on plastics was first reported in the 1970's, it is only in recent years were plastic associated biofilms have gained research attention. Plastic surfaces pose a problem as they are a niche ready for colonisation by diverse biofilm assemblages, composed of specific bacterial communities and putative pathogens prone to acquiring ARGs and resistance in the biofilm. However, the nature of antibiotic resistance on aquatic plastic debris is not yet fully understood and remains a concern. Given the inevitable increase of plastic production and waste generation, microplastics released into the environment may prove to be problematic. This review explores microplastic waste in the ocean and possible concerns that may arise from the presence of microplastics in conjunction with favourable conditions for the development and dispersal of antibiotic resistance in the ocean and food web. • Microplastics fibres and fragments are commonly found polluting the world's ocean. • Microplastics biofilm assemblages are different from free-living communities. • Microplastics serve as a pathway for dispersal of drug resistant bacteria. • Microplastics allow for enrichment and dispersal of antibiotic resistance genes. • A need exist for regulatory frameworks addressing microplastics in aquatic ecosystems.","Stenger, K.S. ; Wikmark, O.G. ; Bezuidenhout, C.C. ; Molale-Tom, L.G.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118130,Environmental Pollution
Impacts Of Microplastic Type On The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Horizontal Gene Transfer Mechanism During Anaerobic Digestion.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are important pollutants in waste activated sludge (WAS), but their interactions during anaerobic digestion (AD) still need to be further explored. This study investigated variations in ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and host bacteria during AD under the pressure of polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). The results showed that the MPs increased methane production by 11.7–35.5%, and decreased ARG abundance by 5.6–24.6%. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease of MGEs (plasmid, prophage, etc.) promoted the decrease of the abundance of multidrug, aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes. Metagenomic annotation revealed that the reduction of key host bacteria (Arenimonas , Lautropia , etc.) reduced the abundance of major ARGs (rsmA , rpoB2 , etc.). Moreover, PP MPs contributed to a reduction in the abundance of functional genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species, ATP synthesis, and cell membrane permeability, which was conducive to reducing the potential for horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. These findings provide insights into the treatment of organic waste containing MPs. [Display omitted] • PA, PE and PP MPs promoted the production of VFAs and methane during AD. • PP and PE MPs significantly reduced ARG abundance and diversity. • The removal of MGEs and host bacteria was the main reason of ARG reduction. • PP MPs inhibited functional genes associated with horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.","Xu, Ming ; Gao, Peng ; Gao, Yuan ; Xiong, Shi-Jin ; Chen, Hao-Qiang ; Shen, Xiao-Xiao",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121090,Journal Of Environmental Management
Antibiotic Resistance In Urban Soils: Dynamics And Mitigation Strategies.,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a critical global health issue with significant clinical and economic implications. AR occurs when microorganisms develop mechanisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the risk of mortality and healthcare costs. While the connection between antibiotic use in clinical and agricultural settings and the emergence of AR is well-established, the role of urban soils as reservoirs and spreaders of AR is underexplored. This review examines the complex dynamics of AR in urban soils, highlighting the various sources of antibiotics, including domestic wastewater, industrial effluents, urban agricultural practices, but also microplastics and domestic animal excrements. The selective pressure exerted by these anthropogenic sources promotes the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly through horizontal gene transfer, which facilitates the transmission of resistance genes among soil microorganisms in urban environments. About that, the presence of antibiotics in urban soils poses a significant threat to public health by potentially transferring resistance genes to human pathogens through multiple pathways, including direct contact, food consumption, and water ingestion. Furthermore, AR in urban soils disrupts microbial community dynamics, impacting soil fertility, plant growth, and overall environmental quality. Therefore, this review aims to address gaps in understanding AR in urban soils, offering insights into its implications for human health and ecosystem integrity. By identifying these gaps and suggesting evidence-based strategies, this review proposes valid and sustainable solutions to mitigate and counteract the spread of AR in urban environments.","Gentile, Annamaria ; Di Stasio, Luca ; Oliva, Gianmaria ; Vigliotta, Giovanni ; Cicatelli, Angela ; Guarino, Francesco ; Nissim, Werther Guidi ; Labra, Massimo ; Castiglione, Stefano",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120120,Environmental Research
A Review Focusing On Mechanisms And Ecological Risks Of Enrichment And Propagation Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Mobile Genetic Elements By Microplastic Biofilms.,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging ubiquitous pollutants in aquatic environment and have received extensive global attention. In addition to the traditional studies related to the toxicity of MPs and their carrier effects, their unique surface-induced biofilm formation also increases the ecotoxicity potential of MPs from multiple perspectives. In this review, the ecological risks of MPs biofilms were summarized and assessed in detail from several aspects, including the formation and factors affecting the development of MPs biofilms, the selective enrichment and propagation mechanisms of current pollution status of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MPs biofilms, the dominant bacterial communities in MPs biofilms, as well as the potential risks of ARGs and MGEs transferring from MPs biofilms to aquatic organisms. On this basis, this paper also put forward the inadequacy and prospects of the current research and revealed that the MGEs-mediated ARG propagation on MPs under actual environmental conditions and the ecological risk of the transmission of ARGs and MGEs to aquatic organisms and human beings are hot spots for future research. Relevant research from the perspective of MPs biofilm should be carried out as soon as possible to provide support for the ecological pollution prevention and control of MPs.

Effects Of Microplastics On Dissipation Of Oxytetracycline And Its Relevant Resistance Genes In Soil Without And With Serratia Marcescens: Comparison Between Biodegradable And Conventional Microplastics.,"The biodegradable (polybutylene adipate terephthalate: PBAT) and conventional (polyethylene: PE) microplastics (MPs) at 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % dosages (w/w) were added into soils with and without Serratia marcescens ZY01 (ZY01, a tet -host strain) to understand their different effects on the dissipation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and tet. The results showed that the dosages of PBAT MP exhibited different inhibition degrees of OTC biodegradation in soils regardless of ZY01, while the dosages of PE MP did not change the enhancement degree of OTC biodegradation in soils without ZY01. These differences were due to the higher adsorption capacity of OTC on PBAT MP and the stronger toxicity of PBAT MP to microorganisms. Besides soil organic matter, pH and total phosphorus were important factors regulating specific tet -host bacteria in soils with MPs (e.g., the nitrogen-cycling bacteria Steroidobacter and Nitrospira) and MPs + ZY01 (e.g., the phosphorus-cycling bacteria Saccharimonadales and Haliangium), respectively. Regardless of ZY01, a stronger selective harboring of tet -host bacteria in PE MP treatments than PBAT MP treatments was observed at the MP dosage of 1 % (w/w), while the opposite trend was true at the MP dosages of 0.5 % and 2 % (w/w). Some specific genera belonging to Actinobacteriota strongly associated with the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), playing a critical role in the horizontal gene transfer of tet in soils especially for the co-existence of MPs and ZY01. This study will be helpful for understanding on how biodegradable and conventional MPs as hotspots affect the environmental behavior of antibiotics and ARGs in soil. [Display omitted] • Inhibition degree of OTC biodegradation in soils was related to PBAT dosages. • PE dosages had little influence on enhancing OTC biodegradation in soils without ZY01. • The 1 % dosage of PE had stronger selective harboring of tet -host bacteria than PBAT. • Beside SOM, pH and TP drove tet abundance in soils without and with ZY01, respectively. • Specific genera from Actinobacteriota with intI1 mainly regulated tet spread in soils.","Zhang, Guixiang ; Ren, Rui ; Yan, Xiurong ; Zhang, Hongyu ; Zhu, Yuen",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117235,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
"Insight Into Effects Of Polyethylene Microplastics In Anaerobic Digestion Systems Of Waste Activated Sludge: Interactions Of Digestion Performance, Microbial Communities And Antibiotic Resistance Genes.","The environmental risks of microplastics (MPs) have raised an increasing concern. However, the effects of MPs in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems of waste activated sludge (WAS), especially on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), have not been clearly understood. Herein, the variation and interaction of digestion performance, microbial communities and ARGs during AD process of WAS in the presence of polyethylene (PE) MPs with two sizes, PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, were investigated. The results showed that the presence of PE MPs, especially PE MPs-1mm, led to the increased hydrolysis of soluble polysaccharides and proteins and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The methane production decreased by 6.1% and 13.8% in the presence of PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, respectively. Together with this process, hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens were enriched, and methanogens participating in acetoclastic methanogenesis were reduced. Meanwhile, ARGs were enriched obviously by the presence of PE MPs, the abundances of which in PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm groups were 1.2–3.0 times and 1.5–4.0 times higher than that in the control by the end of AD. That was associated with different co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial taxa and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria caused by the presence of PE MPs. Together these results suggested the adverse effects of PE MPs on performance and ARGs removal during AD process of WAS through inducing the changes of microbial populations. [Display omitted] • The effects of PE MPs with two sizes in AD systems of WAS were investigated. • PE MPs promoted hydrolysis and acidification and inhibited methanation processes. • Microbial communities associated with AD performance were changed by PE MPs. • ARGs were enriched by PE MPs during AD process. • PE MPs resulted in different ARG-taxa associations and the enrichment of ARG-hosts.","Shi, Jianhong ; Dang, Qiuling ; Zhang, Chuanyan ; Zhao, Xinyu",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119859,Environmental Pollution
Microplastisphere May Induce The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Aquatic Environments: A Review.,"Microplastics have been proven to be hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The enrichment of ARGs in microplastisphere, the specific niche for diverse microbial communities attached to the surface of microplastic, has attracted worldwide attention. By collecting 477 pairs of ARG abundance data belonging to 26 ARG types, based on the standardized mean difference (SMD) under the random effect model, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the ARG enrichment on microplastics in aquatic environments in order to quantitatively elucidate the enrichment effect, with comparison of non-microplastic materials. It was found that ARGs enriched on the microplastics were more abundant than that on the inorganic substrates (SMD = 0.26) and natural water environments (SMD = 0.10), but lower abundant than that on the natural organic substrates (SMD = −0.52). Furthermore, microplastics in freshwater tended to have a higher degree of ARG enrichment than those in saline water and sewage. The biofilm formation stage, structure, and component of microplastisphere may play a significant role in the enrichment of ARGs. [Display omitted] • Microplastics may enrich ARGs in aquatic environments. • ARG enrichment for microplastics is in-between inorganic and organic substrates. • Microplastics can enrich more ARGs in freshwater than in saline water or sewage. • Biofilm formation process affects the ARG enrichment in the microplastisphere.","Yu, Xue ; Zhang, Ying ; Tan, Lu ; Han, Chenglong ; Li, Haixiao ; Zhai, Lifang ; Ma, Weiqi ; Li, Chengtao ; Lu, Xueqiang",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119891,Environmental Pollution
"Climate Warming, Environmental Degradation And Pollution As Drivers Of Antibiotic Resistance.","Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge to public health, but human-caused environmental changes have not been widely recognized as its drivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between environmental degradation and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that the former can potentially fuel the latter with significant public health outcomes. We describe that (i) global warming favors horizontal gene transfer, bacterial infections, the spread of drug-resistant pathogens due to water scarcity, and the release of resistance genes with wastewater; (ii) pesticide and metal pollution act as co-selectors of antibiotic resistance mechanisms; (iii) microplastics create conditions promoting and spreading antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria; (iv) changes in land use, deforestation, and environmental pollution reduce microbial diversity, a natural barrier to antibiotic resistance spread. We argue that management of antibiotic resistance must integrate environmental goals, including mitigation of further increases in the Earth's surface temperature, better qualitative and quantitative protection of water resources, strengthening of sewage infrastructure and improving wastewater treatment, counteracting the microbial diversity loss, reduction of pesticide and metal emissions, and plastic use, and improving waste recycling. These actions should be accompanied by restricting antibiotic use only to clinically justified situations, developing novel treatments, and promoting prophylaxis. It is pivotal for health authorities and the medical community to adopt the protection of environmental quality as a part of public health measures, also in the context of antibiotic resistance management. [Display omitted] • The relation of environmental changes with antibiotic resistance (AR) was reviewed. • Climate change, biodiversity loss, microplastic and chemical pollution promote AR. • Further research assessing the scale of environmental effects on AR is needed. • AR mitigation requires incorporating multifaceted environmental goals. • The medical community must recognize the links between environment quality and AR.","Rzymski, Piotr ; Gwenzi, Willis ; Poniedziałek, Barbara ; Mangul, Serghei ; Fal, Andrzej",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123649,Environmental Pollution
Tire Wear Particles Enhance Horizontal Gene Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Aquatic Ecosystems.,"Microplastics (MPs) have introduced new surfaces for biofilm development and gene exchange among bacteria. We investigated Tire Wear Particles (TWPs) for their involvement in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), particularly in relation to associated metals in the matrices of TWPs. We employed red-fluorescently tagged E. coli strain as a donor with green-fluorescently tagged, broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5, resistant to trimethoprim. As a recipient, we utilized Pseudomonas sp. and a natural lake microbial community. HGT activity on TWPs was determined and compared with that on polystyrene (PS) (with and without metals), and chitosan, which was used as a natural surface. Exposure to TWPs significantly enhanced HGT frequency of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) from donor to recipient compared to PS and chitosan, and metals of TWPs further promoted HGT. HGT frequency on TWPs with Pseudomonas sp. was found to be 10<sup>−3</sup> at 30 °C. in the lake community, it was similarly high already at 25 °C suggesting a higher permissiveness of the natural microbial community towards ARG at lower temperatures. This study sheds light on the potential impact of TWPs in promoting HGT, forming the basis for health risk assessments of TWPs and more generally of MP pollution in various aquatic ecosystems. • Tire wear particles (TWPs) serve as hotspots of horizontal gene exchange (HGT) among bacteria in aquatic ecosystems. • Metals in TWPs play an important role in HGT. • Plasmid exchange primarily happens in microbial biofilms on TWP surfaces. • HGT associated to TWP increases manifold at higher temperatures. • HGT associated to TWP of natural lake bacteria occurs at lower temperatures compared to lab model systems.","Jaffer, Yousuf Dar ; Abdolahpur Monikh, Fazel ; Uli, Klümper ; Grossart, Hans-Peter",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120187,Environmental Research
A Review On The Effect Of Micro- And Nano-Plastics Pollution On The Emergence Of Antimicrobial Resistance.,"The recent upsurge in the studies on micro/nano plastics and antimicrobial resistance genes has proven their deleterious effects on the environmental and human health. Till-date, there is a scarcity of studies on the interactions of these two factors and their combined influence. The interaction of microplastics has led to the formation of new plastics namely plastiglomerates, pyroplastics. and anthropoquinas. It has long been ignored that the occurrence of microplastics has become a breeding ground for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Evidently microplastics are also associated with the occurrence of other pollutants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. The increased use of antibiotics (after Covid breakout) has further elevated the detrimental effects on human health. Therefore, this study highlights the relation of microplastics with antibiotic resistance generation. The factors such as uncontrolled use of antibiotics and negligent plastic consumption has been evaluated. Furthermore, the future research prospective was provided that can be helpful in correctly identifying the seriousness of the environmental occurrence of these pollutants.

The Effect Of Bulk-Biochar And Nano-Biochar Amendment On The Removal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Contaminated Soil.,"Biochar amendment has significant benefits in removing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil. Nevertheless, there is little information on ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. Herein, a 42-day soil microcosm experiment were carried out to study how two coconut shell biochars (bulk- and nano-size) eliminate soil ARGs with/without microplastic presence. The results showed that microplastic increased significantly the numbers and abundances of ARGs in soil at 14d of cultivation. And, two biochars amendment effectively inhibited soil ARGs spread whether or not microplastic was present, especially for nano-biochar which had more effective removal compared to bulk-biochar. However, microplastic weakened soil ARGs removal after applying same biochar. Two biochars removed ARGs through decreasing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, potential host-bacteria abundances, some bacteria crowding the eco-niche of hosts and promoting soil properties. The adverse effect of microplastic on ARGs removal was mainly caused by weakening mobile genetic elements (MGEs) removal, and by changing soil properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that biochar's effect on ARGs profile was changed by its size and microplastic presence through altering MGEs abundances. These results highlight that biochar amendment is still an effective method for ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. [Display omitted] • Biochar effectively removed soil ARGs with or without microplastic presence. • Biochar inhibited the enrichment effect of microplastic on soil ARGs. • Nano-biochar exhibited more effective removal on soil ARGs than bulk-biochar. • ARGs profiles were altered by changing soil properties and bacterial communities.","Su, Xiangmiao ; Qian, Fanghan ; Bao, Yanyu",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117488,Environmental Research
Plastic Leachate Exposure Drives Antibiotic Resistance And Virulence In Marine Bacterial Communities.,"Plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. Plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. However, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. It is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. Here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and AMR within a seawater microcosm community. We show that PVC leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in AMR and virulence genes. In particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches AMR genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. Additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. This study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health. [Display omitted] • PVC leachate exposure increased AMR and virulence gene relative abundance. • Multidrug, aminoglycoside, and peptide resistance genes were significantly increased. • Protein secretion and bacterial counter signalling virulence traits were enriched. • Alteromonas spp. are major contributors to the AMR and virulence gene pools.","Vlaanderen, Eric J. ; Ghaly, Timothy M. ; Moore, Lisa R. ; Focardi, Amaranta ; Paulsen, Ian T. ; Tetu, Sasha G.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121558,Environmental Pollution
Co-Existence Of Polyethylene Microplastics And Tetracycline On Soil Microbial Community And Args.,"Microplastics are plastic particles with particle size less than 5 mm in the environment. As an emerging organic pollutant, the presence of microplastics in the soil environment has been widely noticed. Also, due to the overuse of antibiotics, a large amount of antibiotics that cannot be fully absorbed by humans and livestock enter the soil environment in the form of urine or manure, making the soils suffer from serious antibiotic contamination problems. To address the environmental problems of microplastics and antibiotic contamination in soils, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of PE microplastics on antibiotic degradation, microbial community characteristics and ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. The results showed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the degradation of tetracycline, and significantly increased the organic carbon content and decreased the neutral phosphatase activity. The addition of PE microplastics significantly reduced the alpha diversity of soil microbial community. Compared to the single tetracycline contamination. In addition, combined contamination with PE microplastics and tetracycline significantly affected bacterial genera such as Aeromicrobium , Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium and Intrasporangium. Metagenome sequencing studies revealed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the dissipation of ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. There were strong positive correlations between Multidrug, Aminoglycoside and Clycopeptide resistance genes and Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria in tetracycline contaminated soils, and there was a strong positive correlation between Aminoglycoside resistance genes and Actinobacteria in combined contamination of PE microplastics and tetracycline. This study will provide some data support for the current environmental risk assessment of the coexistence of multiple contaminants in soil.

Improvement Of Biodegradation Of Pet Microplastics With Whole-Cell Biocatalyst By Interface Activation Reinforcement.,"Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an important basic polymer, which was used widely in variety of fields. Due to its high crystallinity, compact structure and strong surface hydrophobicity, PET has prominent resistance to biodegradation. In recent years, microplastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics, was considered as serious threaten to ecosystems. In this study, alkali-resistant bacteria were used as whole-cell catalysts to try to improve the biodegradation of PET microplastics by increasing the bio-interfacial activity of the polymer substrate. Surfactants were applicated to enhance interfacial activation of enzyme and PET interactions. And an integrated strategy was constructed based on alkali resistant bacteria to catalysis the hydrolysis of PET. The results showed that Tween 20 had the most obvious promoting effect among the four interfacial biocatalysts on biological-chemical combined hydrolysis of PET microplastics with whole-cell biocatalysts in alkaline environment. Obvious etching and fracture were observed on the PET fibre surface after biodegradation in presence of surfactant. The weight loss rate of PET substrate can reach 11.04% after 5 days of biodegradation. Thus, this research provides a promising method for efficient degradation of PET microplastics.","Li, Xin ; Wu, Haodong ; Gong, Jixian ; Li, Qiujin ; Li, Zheng ; Zhang, Jianfei",10.1080/09593330.2022.2052359,Environmental Technology
Downward Transport Of Naturally-Aged Light Microplastics In Natural Loamy Sand And The Implication To The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes.,"Current understanding on the fate and behavior of microplastics (MPs) in complex soil media remains inadequate. We characterized the aging and hetero-aggregation of a MP sampled in farmland soil, and explored its vertical downward transport in natural loamy sand. The MP was identified with FTIR spectrum as polypropylene, a plastic lighter than water. FTIR spectrum combined with SEM imaging confirmed the MP was highly aged, generating colloidal plastic fibers and carbonyl groups. SEM imaging coupled with EDX analysis suggested hetero-aggregation of the MP with soil minerals. Soil leaching tests performed with the clean MP (without soil minerals) (CMP), the raw MP (RMP) (with soil minerals), and the RMP with humic acid (HA) (RMP + HA) demonstrated that the mobility was insignificant for the CMP, moderate for the RMP and highest for the RMP + HA, resulting in a maximal downward traveling distance of 0 cm, 3–4 cm, and 9–10 cm, respectively. Correlation between the maximal traveling distance and zeta potential of the CMP, RMP, and RMP + HA confirmed surface charge as a dominant control on the MP mobility; while the increasing density of the MP, due to hetero-aggregation with soil minerals, was identified as a driving mechanism for its downward transport, despite its intrinsic density lower than water. Occurrence of only the lower-sized rod-shaped plastic fibers at the maximal traveling distance suggested the natural aging, a process leading to plastic vibration and fragmentation, was conducive to plastic translocation. The three explored classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulfonamide) were all detected in the plastic surface, suggesting the MP may function as a potential pathway for the dissemination of ARGs to the deeper soil layer. These findings are important to understand the concentration distribution of both the MPs and ARGs in agriculture impacted soils, a natural reservoir of both emerging contaminants. Image 1 • MPs even with a virgin density lower than water could transport downward in soil. • Both hetero-aggregation and aging promote the downward transport. • Hetero-aggregation with soil mineral and NOM increased MP density and zeta potential. • Aging reduced plastic particle size and produced rod-shaped plastic fibers. • MPs are potential vehicles for downward transport of ARGs in agricultural land. Microplastics even lighter than water could transport downward in soil, due to hetero-aggregation and natural aging, and convey the ARGs to deep soil layers.","Yan, Xinyu ; Yang, Xinyao ; Tang, Zhang ; Fu, Jingjing ; Chen, Fangmin ; Zhao, Ying ; Ruan, Lili ; Yang, Yuesuo",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114270,Environmental Pollution
"Distribution And Potential Ecological Risks Of Microplastics In Zhushan Bay, China.","The interaction between microplastics (MPs) and microorganisms may alter the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water and increase the ecological risk of drinking water sources. To investigate the characteristics of MPs geographical distribution and its potential ecological risk in typical urban water, this study was conducted in Zhushan Bay, and we carried out a combination of tests to analyze the distribution of MPs and the migration changes of their surface microbial community composition and ARGs in different media by 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, non-targeted metabolomics and qPCR genomics in the near-shore (I), middle area (Ⅱ) and near-lake (Ⅲ) of Zhushan Bay. The results showed that MPs in fibrous form were dominant in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay; Polyurethane (PU) and Silicone were the main MPs types in Zhushan Bay. The abundance of MPs in the water of Zhushan Bay was winter > summer > autumn > spring; and in the sediment was winter > summer > autumn > spring, respectively. The distribution results of MPs in geographical location are as follows: In the water I > Ⅱ > Ⅲ, sediment exhibited Ⅱ > Ⅲ > I. The results indicate that physicochemical factors will affect the geographical distribution of MPs and their surface microbial community composition in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay. More cooperative behaviors and increased metabolically important pathways occurred in the microbial network on water-MPs compared to sediment-MPs. However, the microbial community in the sediment-MPs was more stable and had higher abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). A total of 362 differential metabolites were detected, of which 193 were up-regulated and 19 down-regulated differential metabolites. blaTEM , Sul , and inti1 were prevalent in both the water and sediments of Zhushan Bay. Sul1 was most contaminated in ARGs. This study provides the latest field data and insights into MPs pollution in key aquatic environments. [Display omitted] • MPs abundance is winter > summer > autumn > spring. • MPs shape is mainly fiber; PU and Silicone are the main MPs types. • Water-MPs is near-shore (Ⅰ)> middle area (Ⅱ)> near-lake (Ⅲ), sediment-MPs is Ⅱ > Ⅲ > Ⅰ. • There are significant differences in microbial diversity on MPs in water and sediment. • There was a significant correlation between MPs, metabolites and ARGs.","Wang, Zhikai ; Li, Qihui ; Huang, Haiqing ; Liu, Jing ; Wang, Jie ; Chen, Yican ; Huang, Suzhen ; Luo, Xingzhang ; Zheng, Zheng",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139024,Chemosphere
Can Low-Temperature Thermal Hydrolysis Mitigate The Oxidative Stress Of Polystyrene Nanoplastics On Anaerobic Digestion?,"The presence of micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) in sewage sludge has sparked considerable apprehensions over their potential negative effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) performance. The occurrence of MPs/NPs can trigger oxidative stress on the anaerobic microbiome, leading to potential inhibition of the AD process. While the thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is an extensively utilized sludge pretreatment method for AD, its impact on stress induced by MPs/NPs during AD remains poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the impacts of low-temperature THP (90 °C, 90 min) on AD of sewage sludge in the presence of 150 μg/L of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) under different solid retention times (SRTs) of 20, 15, and 10 d. The presence of PsNPs resulted in a higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Additionally, their presence caused a significant inhibition of methane production by 28.2%, 29.3%, and 38.8% for SRTs of 20, 15, and 10 d, respectively. Introducing low-temperature THP prior to the AD could partially recover methane production by mitigating ROS-induced stress and curbing the propagation of ARGs during the AD process. These results shed light on the potential benefits of THP and further optimization opportunities in alleviating the adverse effects of MPs/NPs-induced stress during sewage sludge AD. [Display omitted] • PsNPs (150 μg/L) hindered methane production in AD under three different SRTs. • Low-temperature THP as a pre-treatment could partially recover methane production. • PsNPs caused a 41.3% increase in ROS levels under 10 d SRT. • Although PsNPs boosted ARGs propagation, THP showed an opposite pattern. • PsNPs and THP increased the abundance of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium.","Azizi, Seyed Mohammad Mirsoleimani ; Dhar, Bipro Ranjan",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141516,Chemosphere

Dissecting The Effects Of Co-Exposure To Microplastics And Sulfamethoxazole On Anaerobic Digestion.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are frequently and simultaneously detected in sewage and sludge, raising global concerns in recent years. However, their combined effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) remain unclear. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the combinations of different MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate) with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on AD performance and microbial communities. The combined stress slightly decreased the chemical oxygen demand removal rate and total gas/methane production. Furthermore, co-exposure to MPs and SMX visibly changed the anaerobic sludge morphology during AD, reduced the methanogen activity, and increased the residual propionic acid concentration versus a control. The decreased relative abundances of Euryarchaeota ranged from 1.88% to 4.63% in the experimental groups compared with CK, suggesting that the microbial communities were inevitably affected by exposure to SMX alone or combined MPs/SMX. Interestingly, among the top 50 genera, only two were negatively related to a few antibiotic resistance genes, implying that sludge exhibited widespread multiple resistances. The correlation analysis between the MPs and microbial communities suggested that the MP properties, such as the aperture-desorption of MPs, may impact the microbial variations. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of coexisting MPs/SMX on AD. [Display omitted] • Evaluated the combined stress of MPs and SMX on AD performance. • Co-exposure to MPs and SMX changed the anaerobic sludge morphology. • MPs and SMX inevitably affected the microbial communities in AD. • Most genera were positively related to numerous antibiotic resistance genes. • Variations in microbial communities may be due to different MP properties.","Kong, Lingjiao ; Shi, Xianyang",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123562,Journal Of Environmental Management
Antibiotic Resistance Genes Proliferation Under Anaerobic Degradation Of Polylactic Acid And Polyhydroxy Butyrate Bioplastics.,"[Display omitted] • Impact of PLA and PHB on ARGs in AD was studied. • PHB showed a higher biodegradation rate and methane generation than PLA. • PLA showed a higher proliferation of ARGs and their potential host microbes. • A correlation was found between MGEs and ARGs in PLA and PHB reactors. • Both PLA and PHB stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances. As the global concern over plastic pollution grows, efforts are underway to find environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics. Bioplastics are being extensively researched and developed as a possible solution. This study compared the impact of two bioplastics, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB), on the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during anaerobic digestion (AD). Both bioplastics (250–500 particles) could be degraded to a certain extent over 79 days, as indicated by higher methane production than the control without bioplastic particles. The PHB 500 reactor showed the highest methane yield along with the highest biodegradation efficiency (91 %) than other reactors amended with PHB and PLA particles. The highest ARG and MGE abundances were also observed in PLA 500, and the lowest ARG abundance was in PLA 250. Conversely, PHB reactors showed a relatively lower ARG abundance than the control. The correlation analysis suggested that most ARGs were positively correlated with PLA and negatively correlated with PHB (except for tet A, tet B, and tet X). Moreover, a correlation between MGEs and ARGs in PLA and PHB reactors was revealed by correlation analysis. These results show that AD responds differently to the different types/levels of bioplastics, which can ultimately influence the behavior of ARG proliferation. Thus, bioplastics may also pose a potential risk for spreading antibiotic resistance. These findings can be used as a basis for setting environmental standards for bioplastics and creating monitoring and control measures to prevent potential negative impacts on public health.","Haffiez, Nervana ; Zakaria, Basem S. ; Mohammad Mirsoleimani Azizi, Seyed ; Ranjan Dhar, Bipro",10.1016/j.envint.2023.107938,Environment International
Microplastics Existence Intensified Bloom Of Antibiotic Resistance In Livestock Feces Transformed By Black Soldier Fly.,"Efficient degradation of residual antibiotics in livestock and poultry feces by black soldier flies (BSFs) has been widely reported. Nevertheless, the effects of widely detected microplastics in feces on the dynamic reduction of antibiotics and the transfer of gut bacterial resistome remain unclear. In this study, red fluorescence-labeled microplastics are observed to be abundantly distributed in BSFs gut, which caused epithelial cell damage along with gut peristalsis and friction, thereby releasing reactive oxygen species and activating the antioxidant enzyme system. In addition, they result in not only in inflammatory cytokine release to induce gut inflammation, but fecal hardening because of mucus released from the BSFs, thereby hindering organic mineralization and antibiotic degradation. Besides, the gut pathogenic bacteria easily obtain growth energy and crowded out ecological niches by reducing nitrate produced by inflammatory host cells to nitrite with nitrate reductase. Consequently, linear discriminant analysis effect size and detrended correspondence analysis found that microplastic intake significantly reshape the microbial community structure and cause the significant reduction of several important organic-decomposing bacteria and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomonadales , Coriobacteriales , Lachnospirales , and Ruminococcaceae). In addition, a large number of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcaceae , Hungateiclostridiaceae , and Clostridia) are enriched in feces and BSFs gut. Weighted correlation network analysis and bubble diagram analysis indicate that microplastic intake intensified gut colonization of pathogenic bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes/mobile genetic elements, driving the bloom of antibiotic resistance in transformed fecal piles. Therefore, microplastics in feces should be isolated as much as possible before insect transformation. [Display omitted] • Microplastic intake causes oxidative damage and prepupal stage to advance in BSFs. • Microplastic intake hinders the reduction of feces, antibiotics, and ARGs by BSFs. • Microplastic intake causes gut inflammation and reshaped microbiome in BSFs. • Microplastic intensifies gut colonization of pathogenic bacteria carrying ARGs/MGE. • Microplastic intensifies bloom of antibiotic resistance in feces transformed by BSFs.","Xu, Zhimin ; Wu, Xinyue ; Zhang, Jiexiang ; Cheng, Ping ; Xu, Zhihao ; Sun, Weimin ; Zhong, Yuming ; Wang, Yifan ; Yu, Guohui ; Liu, Hui",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120845,Environmental Pollution
Fluvial Flooding And Plastic Pollution – The Delivery Of Potential Human Pathogenic Bacteria Into Agricultural Fields.,"The frequency of plastic debris entering agricultural land is likely going to increase due to increased discharge into surface waters and more frequent flood events. Microbial biofilm on the surfaces of plastic pollution (known as the 'plastisphere') in freshwater environments often includes human pathogenic bacteria capable of causing disease. Pathogens have been detected on the surface of plastics in freshwater environments, but it is yet to be determined whether plastic debris can also transport pathogens into agricultural fields during flooding. Therefore, this study quantified the presence of viable pathogenic bacteria on the surface of plastic pollution at five agricultural fields along two rivers. All visible plastic debris, including sewage-associated plastic waste, were collected along a perpendicular 100 m transect from the riparian zone into each field. All plastic pieces were screened for five target bacteria (Escherichia coli , intestinal enterococci, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp.) using selective media, and positively identified colonies subsequently tested for antimicrobial resistance. In all five fields, there were higher volumes of plastic in the areas closer to the river, with 75% ± 24% of plastic collected within 30 m from the riverbank. Overall, 49% of all plastic collected in agricultural fields was colonised by phenotypically positive colonies for at least one or more target bacteria, with resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics detected among several of these target bacteria. Therefore, the transport of contaminated plastic debris from fluvial floodwater into agricultural fields could pose an as yet unquantified risk of introducing potentially harmful bacteria into agricultural systems and the ultimately into the food chain. [Display omitted] • Plastic debris (including sewage waste) is common in agricultural floodplain fields. • Approximately 75% of plastic in agricultural fields is within 30 m of the river. • Human pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance were common on plastics debris. • Transfer of plastic pollution in floodwater could disseminate human pathogens. • Fluvial flooding introduces plastics and pathogens into agricultural systems.","Pow, Chloe J. ; Fellows, Rosie ; White, Hannah L. ; Woodford, Luke ; Quilliam, Richard S.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125518,Environmental Pollution

Effects Of Freeze-Thaw Dynamics And Microplastics On The Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil Aggregates.,"This is the first study investigating the effects of freeze-thaw (FT) and microplastics (MPs) on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil aggregates (i.e., soil basic constituent and functional unit) via microcosm experiments. The results showed that FT significantly increased the total relative abundance of target ARGs in different aggregates due to the increase in intI1 and ARG host bacteria. However, polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) hindered the increase in ARG abundance caused by FT. The host bacteria carrying ARGs and intI1 varied with aggregate size, and the highest number of hosts was observed in micro-aggregates (<0.25 mm). FT and MPs altered host bacteria abundance by affecting aggregate physicochemical properties and bacterial community and enhanced multiple antibiotic resistance via vertical gene transfer. Although the dominant factors affecting ARGs varied with aggregate size, intI1 was a co-dominant factor in various-sized aggregates. Furthermore, other than ARGs, FT, PE-MPs, and their integration promoted the proliferation of human pathogenic bacteria in aggregates. These findings suggested that FT and its integration with MPs significantly affected ARG distribution in soil aggregates. They amplified antibiotic resistance environmental risks, contributing to a profound understanding of soil antibiotic resistance in the boreal region. [Display omitted] • Effects of FT and MPs on ARG distribution in soil aggregates were investigated. • ARG increase in aggregates under FT was due to elevated intI1 and potential hosts. • FT and MPs enhanced antibiotic resistance via vertical gene transfer. • intI1 was the common factor affecting ARG abundance in different-sized aggregates. • FT, PE-MPs, and their integration promoted the proliferation of HPB in aggregates.","Xu, Fukai ; Guan, Jiunian ; Zhou, Yumei ; Song, Ziwei ; Shen, Yanping ; Liu, Yibo ; Jia, Xiaohui ; Zhang, Baiyu ; Guo, Ping",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138678,Chemosphere
Microplastics Exhibit Accumulation And Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes.,"Although the fates of microplastics (0.1–5 mm) in marine environments and freshwater are increasingly studied, little is known about their vector effect in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Previous studies have evaluated the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on microplastics, but there is no direct evidence for the selection and horizontal transfer of ARGs on different microplastics in WWTPs. Here, we show biofilm formation as well as bacterial community and ARGs in these biofilms grown on four kinds of microplastics via incubation in the aerobic and anaerobic tanks of a WWTP. Microplastics showed differential capacities for bacteria and ARGs enrichment, differing from those of the culture environment. Furthermore, ARGs in microplastic biofilms were horizontally transferred at frequencies higher than those in water samples in both tanks. Therefore, microplastics in WWTPs can act as substrates for horizontal transfer of ARGs, potentially causing a great harm to the ecological environment and adversely affecting human health. [Display omitted] • Microplastics showed differential capacities for bacteria and ARGs enrichment. • The ARGs on microplastic biofilms can be transferred horizontally to free cells. • Microplastic biofilms performed horizontal gene transfer at frequencies higher than sludge.","Feng, Yue ; Sun, Jia-Wen ; Shi, Wei-Wei ; Duan, Jian-Lu ; Sun, Xiao-Dong ; Feng, Li-Juan ; Wang, Qian ; Gan, Yu-Dong ; Yuan, Xian-Zheng",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117632,Journal Of Environmental Management

A Review On Mechanistic Understanding Of Microplastic Pollution On The Performance Of Anaerobic Digestion.,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) has emerged as a promising technology for diverting the organic waste from the landfills along with the production of clean energy. AD is a microbial-driven biochemical process wherein the plethora of microbial communities participate in converting the putrescible organic matter into biogas. Nevertheless, the AD process is susceptible to the external environmental factors such as presence of physical (microplastics) and chemical (antibiotics, pesticides) pollutants. The microplastics (MPs) pollution has received recent attention due to the increasing plastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. This review was aimed for holistic assessment of impact of MPs pollution on AD process to develop efficient treatment technology. First, the possible pathways of MPs entry into the AD systems were critically evaluated. Further, the recent literature on the experimental studies pertaining to the impact of different types of MPs at different concentrations on the AD process was reviewed. In addition, several mechanisms such as direct exposure of MPs on the microbial cells, indirect impact of MPs through the leaching of toxic chemicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation on AD process were elucidated. Besides, the risk possessed by the increase of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after the AD process due to the MPs stress on microbial communities were discussed. Overall, this review deciphered the severity of MPs pollution on AD process at different levels. [Display omitted] • Microplastics influence the biochemical pathways of anaerobic digestion process. • Microplastics directly interact with microbial cells and disrupt the cell walls. • Leaching & reactive oxygen species formation are the indirect inhibitory pathways. • Microplastics exposure increases the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes.","Manu, M.K. ; Luo, Liwen ; Kumar, Reeti ; Johnravindar, Davidraj ; Li, Dongyi ; Varjani, Sunita ; Zhao, Jun ; Wong, Jonathan",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121426,Environmental Pollution

Biofilm Enhances The Interactive Effects Of Microplastics And Oxytetracycline On Zebrafish Intestine.,"• Biofilm-microplastics (Biof-MPs) induced greater zebrafish intestinal response. • Biof-MPs changed the biomarker response mode with oxytetracycline co-exposure. • Biofilm significantly enriched pathogens compared with original microplastics. • Biofilm increased antibiotic resistance genes abundance in zebrafish intestine. The enhanced adsorption of pollutants on biofilm-developed microplastics has been proved in many studies, but the ecotoxicological effects of biofilm-developed microplastics on organisms are still unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to original microplastics, biofilm-developed microplastics, original microplastics absorbed with oxytetracycline (OTC), and biofilm-developed microplastics absorbed with OTC for 30 days. The intestinal histological damage, intestinal biomarker response, gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profile of zebrafish were measured to explore the roles of biofilm in the effects of microplastics. The results showed that biofilm-developed microplastics significantly increased the number of goblet cells in intestinal epithelium compared with the control group. The biofilm-developed microplastics also induced the oxidative response in the zebrafish intestines, and biofilm changed the response mode in the combined treatment with OTC. Additionally, the biofilm-developed microplastics caused intestinal microbiome dysbiosis, and induced the abundance of some pathogenic genera increasing by several times compared with the control group and the original microplastics treatments, regardless of OTC adsorption. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in biofilm-developed microplastics increased significantly compared with the control and the original microplastic treatments. This study emphasized the significant influence and unique role of biofilm in microplastic studies.","Yu, Ziyue ; Qiu, Donghua ; Zhou, Tong ; Zeng, Liqing ; Yan, Changzhou",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106905,Aquatic Toxicology

Effects Of Soil Solarization Combined With Manure-Amended On Soil Args And Microbial Communities During Summer Fallow.,"Soil solarization (SS) is a technique for managing pathogens and weeds, which involves covering with transparent plastic to increase soil temperature during summer fallow (SF). However, SS also alters the diversity of bacterial communities. Therefore, during SF, various organic modifiers are used in combination with SS to improve its efficacy. Organic amendments may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) soils are vital to ensure food security and ecological balance. However, comprehensive study on the effects of SS combined with different types of manure on ARGs in GVP soils during SF remains unclear. Therefore, this study employed high-throughput qPCR to explore the effects of different organic amendments combined with SS on the abundance changes of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in GVP soils during SF. The abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs in GVP soils with different manure fertilization and SS decreased during SF. Horizontal gene transfer via MGEs (especially integrases 45.80%) induced by changes in environmental factors (NO 3 <sup>−</sup>-N 14.7% and NH 4 <sup>+</sup>-N) was the main factor responsible for the changes in ARGs. Proteobacteria (14.3%) and Firmicutes were the main potential hosts of ARGs. Network analysis suggested that Ornithinimicrobium , Idiomarina and Corynebacterium had positive correlations with aminoglycosides, MLSB, and tetracycline resistance genes. These results provide new insights to understand the fate of ARGs in the GVP soils by manure-amended combined with SS during SF, which may help to reduce the spread of ARGs. [Display omitted] • SS combined with different manures application alleviated the ARGs transmission during SF. • During SF, BM mainly reduced Multidrugs, while CM reduced Beta_ Lactamase (21). • HGT via MGEs contributed more to ARGs abundance than physicochemical properties and microbial. • Potential hosts of ARGs mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.","Wang, Xiaojuan ; Zhang, Li ; Gu, Jie ; Feng, Yucheng ; He, Kai ; Jiang, Haihong",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121950,Environmental Pollution
Viral Diversity And Potential Environmental Risk In Microplastic At Watershed Scale: Evidence From Metagenomic Analysis Of Plastisphere.,"[Display omitted] • Microplastic is an important vector for the attachment and dissemination of viruses. • PP has the highest viral diversity and environmental risk among five types of MPs. • Upstream and downstream are two major sources of viruses in MPs cultured in estuary. • MPs properties affect the composition and function of viral communities on MPs. Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a new vector for the long-distance transport of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of viral communities attached on MPs and their environmental risk are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the viral diversity and potential risk in five different MPs collected from the Beilun River based on metagenomic analysis. Nearly 2863 million raw reads were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in the identification of 1719 different species of viruses in MPs. Viruses in polypropylene (PP) displayed the highest diversity, with about 250 specific viruses detected. Source tracking of viruses in MPs by the fast expectation–maximization microbial source tracking method (FEAST) demonstrated that viruses in upstream and downstream MPs are two major sources of viruses in estuary. Furthermore, the MP-type-dependent potential environmental risk of viruses was significant based on both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) detected in viral metagenomes, and PP was confirmed with the highest potential environmental risk. This study reveals the high diversity and potential environmental risk of viruses in different MPs, and provides an important guidance for future environmental monitoring and understanding the potential risks associated with both viral transmission and MPs pollution.","Li, Ruilong ; Zhu, Longji ; Cui, Li ; Zhu, Yong-Guan",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107146,Environment International

Microplastics Increase Impact Of Treated Wastewater On Freshwater Microbial Community.,"Plastic pollution is a major global concern with several million microplastic particles entering every day freshwater ecosystems via wastewater discharge. Microplastic particles stimulate biofilm formation (plastisphere) throughout the water column and have the potential to affect microbial community structure if they accumulate in pelagic waters, especially enhancing the proliferation of biohazardous bacteria. To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 ( int 1), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of int 1 increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles. Likewise, the microbial community on microplastic was more similar to the original wastewater community with increasing microplastic concentrations. Our results show that microplastic particles indeed promote persistence of typical indicators of microbial anthropogenic pollution in natural waters, and substantiate that their removal from treated wastewater should be prioritised.","Eckert, Ester M. ; Di Cesare, Andrea ; Kettner, Marie Therese ; Arias-Andres, Maria ; Fontaneto, Diego ; Grossart, Hans-Peter ; Corno, Gianluca",10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.070,Environmental Pollution
Solid-Liquid Interface Adsorption Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids Induced By Nanoplastics Aggravates Gene Pollution In Aquatic Ecosystems.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have been identified as emerging pollutants in water environment; the interactions between antibiotic resistance plasmids (ARPs) and NPs will influence ARG transport in sediments. Herein, the adsorption experiments of a typical ARP onto polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in river and lake sediments were conducted to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms and the effects of environmental factors. Results indicated that the adsorption amounts of PS-NPs increased with the dosages while decreased with the particle size of sediments. Multi-layer adsorption of PS-NPs was found to exist mainly in sand and silt sediments, whereas the filling adsorption dominated in the clay. Moreover, the adsorbed PS-NPs enhanced the physisorption of ARPs in sediments through stimulating the intraparticle diffusion of ARPs induced by electrostatic force. Besides, the adsorption amounts of ARPs onto the PS-NPs decreased with the increasing pH and dissolve organic matter due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and competitive adsorption. The ion strength played catalytic roles by increasing the electrostatic attraction and adsorption sites of ARPs on PS-NPs. The adsorbed ARPs in sediments were closely related with the ARGs in extra/intracellular DNA of biofilms, influencing the distribution and proliferation of ARGs largely. The findings indicate that ARG-associated pollution might be enhanced by the solid-liquid interface adsorption induced by NPs, which was controlled by pH, ion strength and dissolve organic matter. This study provides supplementary insights into the roles of NPs as carriers of ARP in sediments, and advances our understanding on the risks of NP-ARG co-occurring contamination in aquatic ecosystems. [Display omitted] • Nanoparticle adsorption was affected by sediment composition and particle size. • Nanoparticles enhanced ARP diffusion and affinity by electrostatic force. • PH, ion strength and the dissolved organic matter affected ARP adsorption. • Relative abundance of ARGs in biofilms was positively related to absorbed ARPs.","Li, Zhiheng ; Wang, Mengjun ; Fang, Hong ; Yao, Zhangchao ; Liu, Huijun ; Zhao, Wenlu ; Chen, Jie",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120456,Environmental Pollution

Accumulation Of Antibiotics In The Environment: Have Appropriate Measures Been Taken To Protect Canadian Human And Ecological Health?,"In Canada, every day, contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) are discharged from waste treatment facilities into freshwaters. CECs such as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal care products (PCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and microplastics are legally discharged from sewage treatment plants (STPs), water reclamation plants (WRPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs), or other forms of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). In 2006, the Government of Canada established the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) to classify chemicals based on a risk-priority assessment, which ranked many CECs such as PhACs as being of low urgency, therefore permitting these substances to continue being released into the environment at unmonitored rates. The problem with ranking PhACs as a low priority is that CMP's risk management assessment overlooks the long-term environmental and synergistic effects of PhAC accumulation, such as the long-term risk of antibiotic CEC accumulation in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The goal of this review is to specifically investigate antibiotic CEC accumulation and associated environmental risks to human and environmental health, as well as to determine whether appropriate legislative strategies are in place within Canada's governance framework. In this research, secondary data on antibiotic CEC levels in Canadian and international wastewaters, their potential to promote antibiotic-resistant residues, associated environmental short- and long-term risks, and synergistic effects were all considered. Unlike similar past reviews, this review employed an interdisciplinary approach to propose new strategies from the perspectives of science, engineering, and law. • Antibiotics as contaminants of emerging concern are increasing being released from WWTPs and give rise to ARB and ARG. • The current Canadian Chemical Management Plan (CMP) does not include routine monitoring of antibiotic CECs from wastewater. • Knowledge gaps between scientific data and policy need to be addressed. • A precautionary principle needs to be adopted to prevent antibiotic CECs from becoming long term health risks.","Aladekoyi, Oluwatosin ; Siddiqui, Salsabil ; Hania, Patricia ; Hamza, Rania ; Gilbride, Kimberley",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116513,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
Size-Dependent Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Gut Metagenome And Antibiotic Resistance In C57Bl/6 Mice.,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat for marine and terrestrial ecosystems, which has raised global concerns about its implications for human health. Mounting evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a key role in human health and diseases. The gut bacteria could be disturbed by many environmental factors, including the microplastic particles. However, the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on mycobiome, as well as gut functional metagenome has not been well studied. In this study, we performed ITS sequencing to explore the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on the fungal composition, in combination with the shotgun metagenomics sequencing to reveal the size effects of polystyrene on the functional metagenome. We found that polystyrene microplastic particles with 0.05–0.1 µm diameter showed greater impact on the bacterial and fungal composition of gut microbiota as well as the metabolic pathways than the polystyrene microplastic particles with 9–10 µm diameter. Our results suggested that size-depended effects should not be ignored in the health risk assessment of microplastics. [Display omitted] • Stronger responses to PS exposure were found in intestinal fungi than bacteria. • 0.05–0.1 µm PS showed greater impact on the gut bacterial and fungal composition. • 0.05–0.1 µm PS induced more changes in the microbial metabolic pathways. • Size-depended effects should be considered in the risk assessment of microplastics.","Gao, Bei ; Shi, Xiaochun ; Li, Shanshan ; Xu, Weichen ; Gao, Nan ; Shan, Jinjun ; Shen, Weishou",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114737,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
Stable Isotopes And Nanosims Single-Cell Imaging Reveals Soil Plastisphere Colonizers Able To Assimilate Sulfamethoxazole.,"The presence and accumulation of both, plastics and antibiotics in soils may lead to the colonization, selection, and propagation of soil bacteria with certain metabolic traits, e.g., antibiotic resistance, in the plastisphere. However, the impact of plastic-antibiotic tandem on the soil ecosystem functioning, particularly on microbial function and metabolism remains currently unexplored. Herein, we investigated the competence of soil bacteria to colonize plastics and degrade <sup>13</sup>C-labeled sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Using single-cell imaging, isotope tracers, soil respiration and SMX mineralization bulk measurements we show that microbial colonization of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces takes place within the first 30 days of incubation. Morphologically diverse microorganisms were colonizing both plastic types, with a slight preference for PE substrate. CARD-FISH bacterial cell counts on PE and PS surfaces formed under SMX amendment ranged from 5.36 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 2.06 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and 2.06 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 3.43 × 10<sup>3</sup> hybridized cells mm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry measurements show that <sup>13</sup>C enrichment was highest at 130 days with values up to 1.29 atom%, similar to those of the <sup>13</sup>CO 2 pool (up to 1.26 atom%, or 22.55 ‰). Independent Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between the control plastisphere samples incubated without SMX and those in <sup>13</sup>C-SMX incubations (P < 0.001). Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating, at single-cell level, the capacity of bacterial colonizers of plastics to assimilate <sup>13</sup>C-SMX from contaminated soils. These findings expand our knowledge on the role of soil-seeded plastisphere microbiota in the ecological functioning of soils impacted by anthropogenic stressors.

Microplastics As Vectors Of Chemical Contaminants And Biological Agents In Freshwater Ecosystems: Current Knowledge Status And Future Perspectives.,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous, and their environmental fate is becoming an issue of concern. Our review aims to synthesize current knowledge status and provide future perspectives regarding the vector effect of MPs for chemical contaminants and biological agents. The evidence in the literature indicates that MPs are a vector for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and pharmaceuticals. Concentrations of chemical contaminant in orders of six-fold higher on MPs surfaces than in the surrounding environmental waters have been reported. Chemical pollutants such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PAFSs), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), exhibiting polarities in the range of 3.3–9 are the commonest chemicals reported on MP surfaces. Regarding metals on MPs including chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), the presence of C–O and N–H in MPs promote a relatively high adsorption of these metals onto MP surfaces. Regarding pharmaceuticals, not much has been done, but a few studies indicate that commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen have been associated with MPs. There is sufficient evidence supporting the claim that MPs can act as vectors for viruses, bacterial and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, and MPs act to accelerate horizontal and vertical gene transfer. An area that deserves urgent attention is whether MPs can act as vectors for invertebrates and vertebrates, mainly non-native, invasive freshwater species. Despite the ecological significance of invasive biology, little research has been done in this regard. Overall, our review summarises the state of the current knowledge, identifies critical research gaps and provides perspectives for future research. [Display omitted] • Microplastics adsorb chemical and biological agents in aquatic environments. • The vector effect of microplastics deserve consideration in risk assessment. • Microplastic transport biological organisms in riverine systems. • Vector effects of microplastics have serious ecological implications.","Tumwesigye, Edgar ; Felicitas Nnadozie, Chika ; C Akamagwuna, Frank ; Siwe Noundou, Xavier ; William Nyakairu, George ; Odume, Oghenekaro Nelson",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121829,Environmental Pollution
Enhanced Propagation Of Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Municipal Wastewater By Microplastics.,"Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global concern as they are abundant in the environment and can act as vectors of various contaminants. However, whether and how MPs can be vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs), remains far from explicit. This study addresses the adsorption of both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and eARGs by four types of MPs in municipal wastewater, and then explores the potential horizontal gene transfer of iARGs and eARGs exposed to MPs. Results indicate that though MPs significantly adsorbed both iARGs and eARGs, eARGs were adsorbed with a significantly higher fold enrichment (2.0–5.0 log versus 2.0–3.3 log) and rate (0.0056 min<sup>−1</sup> versus 0.0037 min<sup>−1</sup>) than iARGs. While all four types of MPs adsorbed ARGs, polypropylene MPs showed the highest adsorption capacity for ARGs. Background constituents such as humic acid and antibiotics significantly inhibited adsorption of iARGs, but not eARGs on MPs. The presence of sodium chloride didn't significantly affect adsorption of iARGs or eARGs. The adsorption of ARGs was well explained by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) interaction energy profile. Higher eARG adsorption was attributed to a lower energy barrier between MPs and eARGs than that between MPs and iARGs. Exposure to MPs enhanced horizontal gene transfer of both iARGs and eARGs by 1.5 and 2.0 times, respectively. The improved contact potential between donors and recipients, as well as the increased cell permeability of recipients induced the improved horizontal gene transfer by MPs. This study underscores the need to address ARG propagation through adsorption to MPs. [Display omitted] • Extracellular ARGs are adsorbed at higher fold and rate than intracellular ARGs. • Polypropylene have the highest adsorption capacity of ARGs among all microplastics. • Pollutants alleviate adsorption of intracellular but not extracellular ARGs. • The interaction energy well explains the adsorption of ARGs by microplastics. • Exposure to microplastics enhances horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.","Cheng, Yuan ; Lu, Jiarui ; Fu, Shusen ; Wang, Shangjie ; Senehi, Naomi ; Yuan, Qingbin",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118284,Environmental Pollution
Synthetic And Natural Rubber Associated Chemicals Drive Functional And Structural Changes As Well As Adaptations To Antibiotics In In Vitro Marine Microbiomes.,"The leaching of additives from plastics and elastomers (rubbers) has raised concerns due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemicals extracted from two types of rubber on microbiomes derived from a benthic sea urchin and two pelagic fish species. Additionally, we examined whether bacterial communities preconditioned with rubber-associated chemicals displayed adaptations to antibiotics. At the highest tested concentrations of chemicals, we observed reduced maximum growth rates and yields, prolonged lag phases, and increased alpha diversity. While the effects on alpha and beta diversity were not always conclusive, several bacterial genera were significantly influenced by chemicals from the two rubber sources. Subsequent exposure of sea urchin microbiomes preconditioned with rubber chemicals to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin resulted in decreased maximum growth rates. This indicates a more sensitive microbiome to ciprofloxacin when preconditioned with rubber chemicals. Although no significant interaction effects between rubber chemicals and ciprofloxacin exposure were observed in bacterial alpha and beta diversity, we observed log-fold changes in two bacterial genera in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings highlight the structural and functional alterations in microbiomes originating from various marine species when exposed to rubber-associated chemicals and underscore the potential risks posed to marine life. • Rubber chemicals elicited structural and functional effects on marine microbiomes. • Effects were inconclusive on alpha and beta diversity of the microbiomes. • Specific bacterial genera were affected by the chemicals extracted from rubber. • Preconditioning with rubber chemicals increased the sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. • There are potential risks of rubber-associated chemicals for the microbiome hosts.","Carlsen, Eira Catharine Lødrup ; Hjelset, Sverre ; Gomes, Tânia ; Igartua, Amaia ; Sørensen, Lisbet ; Booth, Andy M. ; Hylland, Ketil ; Eiler, Alexander",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116134,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
Distinct Profile Of Bacterial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Ganjiang River At The Watershed Level.,"Microplastics are of great public concern due to their wide distribution and the potential risk to humans and animals. In this study, the microplastic pollution associated with bacterial communities, human pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated compared to water, sediment, and natural wood particles. Microplastics were widely distributed in surface water of the Ganjiang River at a watershed level with an average value of 407 particles m<sup>−3</sup>. The fragment was the main microplastic shape found in the basin. Microplastics had significantly higher observed species and Chao1 index of bacterial communities than those in water, but comparable to wood particles. However, there was no difference in the microplastics pollution and alpha diversity indices of bacterial between different reaches along the Ganjiang River. Flavobacterium , Rhodoferax , Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium on the microplastics were all found to be enriched compared with water and sediment. Principal component analysis of the composition and function profile of bacterial communities showed that microplastics provide a new microbial niche in the Ganjiang River, which was distinct from water, sediment, and natural wood. Pseudomonas genus dominated the composition of human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics, which was significantly different from water and sediment. No difference was observed in the relative abundance of total ARGs among the four media. However, microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs compared with water and sediment. • The distinct composition of bacterial communities on microplastics was found. • Pseudomonas genus dominated the human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics. • Microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs. • No enrichment effect of microplastics on ARGs was observed at the watershed level.","Hu, Hua ; Jin, Danfeng ; Yang, Yuyi ; Zhang, Jian ; Ma, Changpo ; Qiu, Zumin",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111363,Environmental Research
Effects Of Combined Microplastics And Heavy Metals Pollution On Terrestrial Plants And Rhizosphere Environment: A Review.,"Microplastics (MPs) can enter the soil environment through industry, agricultural production and daily life sources. Their interaction with heavy metals (HMs) poses a significant threat to a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural ones, thereby affecting crop quality and threatening human health. This review initially addresses the impact of single and combined contamination with MPs and HMs on soil environment, including changes in soil physicochemical properties, microbial community structure and diversity, fertility, enzyme activity and resistance genes, as well as alterations in heavy metal speciation. The article further explores the effects of this pollution on the growth characteristics of terrestrial plants, such as plant biomass, antioxidant systems, metabolites and photosynthesis. In general, the combined contaminants tend to significantly affect soil environment and terrestrial plant growth, i.e., the impact of combined contaminants on plants weight ranged from −87.5% to 4.55%. Similarities and differences in contamination impact levels stem from the variations in contaminant types, sizes and doses of contaminants and the specific plant growth environments. In addition, MPs can not only infiltrate plants directly, but also significantly affect the accumulation of HMs in terrestrial plants. The heavy metals concentration in plants under the treatment of MPs were 70.26%–36.80%. The co-occurrence of these two pollution types can pose a serious threat to crop productivity and safety. Finally, this study proposes suggestions for future research aiming to address current gaps in knowledge, raises awareness about the impact of combined MPs + HMs pollution on plant growth and eco-environmental security. [Display omitted] • The properties of MPs significantly affect their impacts on terrestrial plants. • The combined toxicity of MPs and HMs closely related to their uptake in plants. • Combined toxicity causes oxidative and photosynthesis damage, metabolic disturbance. • Compound pollutants affect soil physicochemical properties, microorganism and enzymes. • Biodegradable-MPs seem to cause greater impacts on soil environment and plant growth.","Xu, Lei ; Xie, Wenjun ; Dai, Huiping ; Wei, Shuhe ; Skuza, Lidia ; Li, Jianan ; Shi, Cailing ; Zhang, Lichang",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142107,Chemosphere
Exposure To Microplastics Reduces The Bioaccumulation Of Sulfamethoxazole But Enhances Its Effects On Gut Microbiota And The Antibiotic Resistome Of Mice.,"Microplastics (MPs) have aroused a global health concern and their coexistence with antibiotics is inevitable. However, how MPs would affect the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in humans remains poorly understood. Here a mouse model was used, and through dietary exposure, we observed that while the relative distributions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in tissues were relatively stable, MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues (liver, lung, spleen, heart and kidney). Notably, while SMX and MPs showed a differential effect, MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, with the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes and multidrug genes being significantly increased. We further identified that shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice. Combined, our results demonstrate that MPs reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX, but they enhanced its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice, indicating they might have high risks to humans. [Display omitted] • This is the first report on the effects of MPs on SMX bioaccumulation and their risks in mice. • MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues. • MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and ARG profile. • Combined exposure significantly increased the relative abundances of ARGs. • Shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice.","Liu, Jin ; Lv, Min ; Sun, Anqi ; Ding, Jing ; Wang, Yunqing ; Chang, Xianbo ; Chen, Lingxin",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133810,Chemosphere
Large-Scale Patterns Of Soil Antibiotic Resistome In Chinese Croplands.,"Soil is a vital reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but we still know little about their distribution in cropland soils and the main driving forces. Here we performed an investigation for ARGs patterns in 105 cropland soils (planted with maize, peanut or soybean) along a 2, 200 km transect in China using high-throughput quantitative PCR approaches. Totally, 204 ARGs were detected, with a higher diversity found in central China than that in northeast and south China. The most abundant (top 50%) and highly shared (present in >50% samples) ARGs regarded as core resistome were dominated by multidrug resistance genes such as oprJ , acrA-05 and acrA-04. Regressive analyses revealed that the relative abundance of total ARGs and core resistome both had significant relationships with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Anthropogenic factors including the consumption of plastic films and soil properties including heavy metals showed good correlations with the diversity of ARGs. Structural equation modelling analysis further explained that anthropogenic factors were the main forces shaping the ARGs patterns. These findings highlight the importance of human activities in shaping soil antibiotic resistome in the croplands, providing potential management strategies to mitigate the dissemination of ARGs to humans via food chain. Unlabelled Image • Cropland soils are important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). • The most abundant and highly shared ARGs were multidrug resistance genes. • Soil ARGs was significantly correlated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). • Human activities is dominant in regulating the ARGs patterns in cropland soils.","Du, Shuai ; Shen, Ju-Pei ; Hu, Hang-Wei ; Wang, Jun-Tao ; Han, Li-Li ; Sheng, Rong ; Wei, Wen-Xue ; Fang, Yun-Ting ; Zhu, Yong-Guan ; Zhang, Li-Mei ; He, Ji-Zheng",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136418,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects Of Microplastics On Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Recirculating Aquaculture System.,"Microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two kinds of emerging contaminants with frequent detection in coastal regions. However, rare information on co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in coastal recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is available. This study performed field sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the distribution of microplastics and ARGs in a typical RAS farm. The results showed that microplastics were detected in all water samples with the abundances ranging from 58 to 72 items/m<sup>3</sup>. Absolute abundances of total 10 ARGs in water samples ranged from 3.24 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 7.83 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL while those on microplastic samples were in the range of 1.59 × 10<sup>9</sup>-1.83 × 10<sup>9</sup> copies/g. Microbial communities of microplastics and water showed significant difference at both phylum and genus levels. Microbial community diversity of microplastics was higher than that of water. ARGs including tet G, qnr S, sul 1, sul 2, and erm F possessed relatively more active relationships with bacterial community in water and on microplastics of the RAS farm. The results suggested that microplastics might be an important reservoir of ARGs in RAS farms. The findings of this study will provide useful information on pollution control and environmental management for both microplastics and ARGs in coastal aquaculture systems.

"Microplastics As Emergent Contaminants In Landfill Leachate: Source, Potential Impact And Remediation Technologies.","A significant amount of plastic waste is generated each year on a global scale, in which the maximum quantity of plastic waste is typically dumped in landfills in various parts of the world. Moreover, dumping plastic waste in landfills cannot address the issue of proper disposal; it simply delays the process. Exploiting waste resources entails environmental hazards because plastic wastes buried in landfills gradually break down into Microplastics (MPs) due to physical, chemical, and biological effects. The possibility of landfill leachate as a source of MPs in the environment has not received much attention. Without systematic treatment, MPs in leachate increase the risk to human health and environmental health since they contain dangerous and toxic pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes transmitted by leachate vectors. Due to their severe environmental risks, MPs are now widely recognized as emerging pollutants. Therefore, the composition of MPs in landfill leachate and the interaction of MPs with other hazardous contaminants are summarised in this review. The available potential mitigation or treatment methods of MPs in landfill leachate as of now, along with the drawbacks and challenges of the present leachate treatment for eliminating MPs, are described in this review. Since it is unclear how MPs will be removed from the current leachate facilities, it is crucial to develop innovative treatment facilities as quickly as possible. Finally, the areas that require more research to provide complete solutions to the persistent problem of plastic debris are discussed. • The environmental impact of microplastic landfills has been overlooked. • The distribution of microplastics in landfills is proposed. • Strategies for efficient treatment of microplastics are enumerated. • Difficulties in implementing these microplastic removal strategies are discussed.","V, Godvinsharmila ; Shanmugavel, Surya Prakash ; Tyagi, Vinay Kumar ; Rajesh Banu, J.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118240,Journal Of Environmental Management
Co-Selection Of Multi-Antibiotic Resistance In Bacterial Pathogens In Metal And Microplastic Contaminated Environments: An Emerging Health Threat.,"Abstract Misuse/over use of antibiotics increases the threats to human health since this is a main reason behind evolution of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. However, metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, copper and cadmium are accumulating to critical concentration in the environment and triggering co-selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The co-selection of metal driven antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved through co-resistance or cross resistance. Metal driven antibiotic resistant determinants evolved in bacteria and present on same mobile genetic elements are horizontally transferred to distantly related bacterial human pathogens. Additionally, in marine environment persistent pollutants like microplastics is recognized as a vector for the proliferation of metal/antibiotics and human pathogens. Recently published research confirmed that horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distinct microbes present on microplastics is much faster than free living microbes. Therefore, microplastics act as an emerging hotspot for metal driven co-selection of multidrug resistant human pathogens and pose serious threat to humans which do recreational activities in marine environment and ingest marine derived foods. Therefore, marine environment co-polluted with metal, antibiotics, human pathogens and microplastics pose an emerging health threat globally. Graphical abstract Image Highlights • Bacterial human pathogens co-selects multi-antibiotic resistance in metal polluted environment. • Microplastics act as a hotspot for co-selection of metal-driven multi-antibiotic resistant human pathogens. • Microplastics are potential vector for spread of human pathogens in marine environment.","Imran, Md. ; Das, Kirti Ranjan ; Naik, Milind Mohan",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.114,Chemosphere
"Microplastics In Landfill And Leachate: Occurrence, Environmental Behavior And Removal Strategies.","Plastic wastes buried in landfill are gradually broken and decomposed into microplastics under physical, chemical and biological effects, bringing environmental risks to the exploitation of waste resources. Landfill leachate as a potential source of environmental microplastics has not good attention. Microplastics in leachate carry toxic and harmful pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes, and these vectors pose greater risks to human and environmental health without systematic treatment. Recently, the main technologies of landfill leachate treatment process include order batch activated sludge process, membrane biological reaction process, flocculation process, combined filtration process, and constructed wetland process. However, there is still little knowledge about microplastic removal of the existing leachate treatment facilities, and some technologies to alleviate the sources of such microplastics should be timely developed. This paper systematically summarizes the occurrence of plastics, microplastics and nanoplastics in leachate and their interactive pollution with other toxic pollutants. Meanwhile, the prospects of their environmental behaviors in landfill and leachate are put forward. The microplastic removal by existing leachate treatment equipment and the limitations and challenges to upgrading process of development and implementation are also discussed. The paper can provide a scientific basis for studying the fate of microplastics in landfill and leachate.

Biodegradation Of Polyethylene And Polystyrene By Zophobas Atratus Larvae From Bangladeshi Source And Isolation Of Two Plastic-Degrading Gut Bacteria.,"Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern globally, and novel and eco-friendly approaches like bioremediation are essential to mitigate the impact. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and expanded polystyrene (EPS) are three of the most frequently used plastic types. This study examined biodegradation of these using Zophobas atratus larvae , followed by isolation and whole genome sequencing of gut bacteria collected from larvae frass. Over 36 days, 24.04 % LDPE, 20.01 % EPS, and 15.12 % LLDPE were consumed on average by the larvae, with survival rates of 85 %, 90 %, and 87 %, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of fresh plastic types, consumed plastics, and larvae frass showed proof of plastic oxidation in the gut. Frass bacteria were isolated and cultured in minimal salt media supplemented with plastics as the sole carbon source. Two isolates of bacteria were sampled from these cultures, designated PDB-1 and PDB-2. PDB-1 could survive on LDPE and LLDPE as carbon sources, whereas PDB-2 could survive on EPS. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) provided proof of degradation in both cases. Both isolates were identified as strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by sequencing, assembly, and annotation of their genomes. LDPE- and LLDPE-degrading enzymes e.g., P450 monooxygenase, alkane monooxygenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, etc. were identified in PDB-1. Similarly, phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes involved in EPS degradation were identified in PDB-2. Genes of both isolates were compared with genomes of known plastic-degrading P. aeruginosa strains. Virulence factors, antibiotic-resistance genes, and rhamnolipid biosurfactant biosynthesis genes were also identified in both isolates. This study indicated Zophobas atratus larvae as potential LDPE, LLDPE, and EPS biodegradation agent. Additionally, the isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provide a more direct and eco-friendly solution for plastic degradation. Confirmation and modification of the plastic-degrading pathways in the bacteria may create scope for metabolic engineering in the future.

"Plastisphere In Lake Waters: Microbial Diversity, Biofilm Structure, And Potential Implications For Freshwater Ecosystems.","Once dispersed in water, microplastic (MP) particles are rapidly colonised by aquatic microbes, which can adhere and grow onto solid surfaces in the form of biofilms. This study provides new insights on microbial diversity and biofilm structure of plastisphere in lake waters. By combining Fourier Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing, we investigated the microbial colonization patterns on floating MPs and, for the first time, the occurrence of eukaryotic core members and their possible relations with biofilm-forming bacterial taxa within the plastisphere of four different lakes. Through PCR-based methods (qPCR, LAMP-PCR), we also evaluated the role of lake plastisphere as long-term dispersal vectors of potentially harmful organisms (including pathogens) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in freshwater ecosystems. Consistent variation patterns of the microbial community composition occurred between water and among the plastisphere samples of the different lakes. The eukaryotic core microbiome was mainly composed by typical freshwater biofilm colonizers, such as diatoms (Pennales, Bacillariophyceaea) and green algae (Chlorophyceae), which interact with eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes of different trophic levels. Results also showed that MPs are suitable vectors of biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogens and a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer, likely facilitating antibiotic resistance spread in the environments. [Display omitted] • Microorganisms of different trophic levels constituted plastisphere in lakes. • Eukaryotic plastisphere differed from planktonic communities and among lakes. • Plastisphere shared a core microbiome. • Plastisphere hosted potential harmful, parasitic and pathogenic organisms.","Di Pippo, Francesca ; Crognale, Simona ; Levantesi, Caterina ; Vitanza, Luca ; Sighicelli, Maria ; Pietrelli, Loris ; Di Vito, Stefania ; Amalfitano, Stefano ; Rossetti, Simona",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119876,Environmental Pollution
Does Antifouling Paint Select For Antibiotic Resistance?,"There is concern that heavy metals and biocides contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5–4 weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and IS CR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.","Flach, Carl-Fredrik ; Pal, Chandan ; Svensson, Carl Johan ; Kristiansson, Erik ; Östman, Marcus ; Bengtsson-Palme, Johan ; Tysklind, Mats ; Larsson, D.G.

Microplastics Act As Vectors For Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Landfill Leachate: The Enhanced Roles Of The Long-Term Aging Process.,"Microplastics (MPs) are found to be ubiquitous and serve as vectors for other contaminants, and the inevitable aging process changes MP properties and fates. However, whether the MPs in aging process affects the fates of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in aquatic environments is poorly understood. Herein, the physicochemical property alteration of MPs being aged in landfill leachate, an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs, was investigated, and microbial community evolution and ARGs occurrence of MP surface during the aging process were analyzed. Aging process remarkably altered surface properties, including increasing specific surface areas, causing the formation of oxygen-containing groups, and changing surface morphology, which further increased the probability of microbial colonization. The bacterial assemblage on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential compared to leachate. ARGs quantification results suggested that MPs exhibited selective enrichment for ARGs in a ratio of 5.7–10<sup>3</sup> folds, and the aging process enhanced the enrichment potential. Further co-occurrence networks suggested that the existence of non-random, closer and more stable ARGs-bacterial taxa relations on MP surface affected the ARG transmission. The study of ARG partitioning on MPs indicated that extracellular DNA was a nonnegligible reservoir of ARGs attached on MP surface, and that biofilm bacterial community influenced ARGs partitioning pattern during the aging process. This study confirmed that the aging process could enhance the potential of MPs as vectors for ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding of MP behavior and risk in natural environments. Image 1 • Natural aging in leachate changed physicochemical properties of MPs. • Aged MPs with altered surface properties induced the attachment of bacteria. • Bacterial communities on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential. • Natural aging process enhanced selective enrichment of ARGs on MPs. • Bacterial taxa-ARGs co-occurrence affected the ARG transmission on MPs. Aging process of microplastics in leachate favoured the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes by altering physicochemical property and prompting the formation of specialized ARGs-bacterial taxa associations.","Su, Yinglong ; Zhang, Zhongjian ; Zhu, Jundong ; Shi, Jianhong ; Wei, Huawei ; Xie, Bing ; Shi, Huahong",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116278,Environmental Pollution
Microplastic Pollution Increases Gene Exchange In Aquatic Ecosystems.,"Pollution by microplastics in aquatic ecosystems is accumulating at an unprecedented scale, emerging as a new surface for biofilm formation and gene exchange. In this study, we determined the permissiveness of aquatic bacteria towards a model antibiotic resistance plasmid, comparing communities that form biofilms on microplastics vs. those that are free-living. We used an exogenous and red-fluorescent E. coli donor strain to introduce the green-fluorescent broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5 which encodes for trimethoprim resistance. We demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with microplastics compared to bacteria that are free-living or in natural aggregates. Moreover, comparison of communities grown on polycarbonate filters showed that increased gene exchange occurs in a broad range of phylogenetically-diverse bacteria. Our results indicate horizontal gene transfer in this habitat could distinctly affect the ecology of aquatic microbial communities on a global scale. The spread of antibiotic resistance through microplastics could also have profound consequences for the evolution of aquatic bacteria and poses a neglected hazard for human health.","Arias-Andres, Maria ; Klümper, Uli ; Rojas-Jimenez, Keilor ; Grossart, Hans-Peter",10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.058,Environmental Pollution

The Dangerous Transporters: A Study Of Microplastic-Associated Bacteria Passing Through Municipal Wastewater Treatment.,"Microplastics (MPs) provide a stable and protective habitat for diverse wastewater bacteria, including pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant species. Therefore, MPs may potentially transport these bacteria through wastewater treatment steps to the environment and far distances. This study investigated bacterial communities of MP-associated bacteria from different stages of municipal wastewater treatment processes to evaluate the potential negative effect of these biofilms on the environment. The results showed a high diversity of bacteria that were strongly attached to MPs. After all treatment steps, the core bacterial groups remained attached to MPs and escaped from the wastewater treatment plant with effluent water. Several pathogenic bacteria were identified in MP samples from all treatment steps, and most of them were found in effluent water. These data provide new insights into the possible impacts of wastewater-derived MPs on the environment. MP-associated biofilms were proved to be important sources of pathogens and antibiotic-resistant genes in natural waters. [Display omitted] • Effluent microplastics carry a variety of different bacteria into the environment. • Wastewater microplastic biofilms contain bacteria from the human gut microbiome. • Primary and tertiary treatment have a minor impact on microplastic biofilm structure. • Effluent microplastic biofilms are combined of influent and activated sludge bacteria. • Wastewater microplastics are possible hotspots for the spread of harmful bacteria.","Kruglova, Antonina ; Muñoz-Palazón, Barbara ; Gonzalez-Martinez, Alejandro ; Mikola, Anna ; Vahala, Riku ; Talvitie, Julia",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120316,Environmental Pollution
Mechanisms Of Inhibition And Recovery Under Multi-Antibiotic Stress In Anammox: A Critical Review.,"With the escalating global concern for emerging pollutants, particularly antibiotics, microplastics, and nanomaterials, the potential disruption they pose to critical environmental processes like anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) has become a pressing issue. The anammox process, which plays a crucial role in nitrogen removal from wastewater, is particularly sensitive to external pollutants. This paper endeavors to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the inhibition mechanisms of multi-antibiotic on anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, along with insights into their recovery processes. The paper dives deeply into the various ways antibiotics interact with anammox bacteria, focusing specifically on their interference with the bacteria's extracellular polymers (EPS) - crucial components that maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the cells. Additionally, it explores how anammox bacteria utilize quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms to regulate their community structure and respond to antibiotic stress. Moreover, the paper summarizes effective removal methods for these antibiotics from wastewater systems, which is crucial for mitigating their inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria. Finally, the paper offers valuable insights into how anammox communities can recuperate from multi-antibiotic stress. This includes strategies for reintroducing healthy bacteria, optimizing operational conditions, and using bioaugmentation techniques to enhance the resilience of anammox communities. In summary, this paper not only enriches our understanding of the complex interactions between antibiotics and anammox bacteria but also provides theoretical and practical guidance for the treatment of antibiotic pollution in sewage, ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes. [Display omitted] • The inhibition mechanism of AnAOB by different antibiotics was revealed. • Degradation and adsorption of antibiotics were explained by EPS in AnAOB consortia. • The acquisition and dissemination of AnAOB resistance genes were summarized. • Recovery mechanisms of AnAOB under multi-antibiotic stress were expounded. • Removal means of multi-antibiotic from wastewater were characterized.","Ji, Xu ; Zhang, Xiaonong ; Ju, Ting ; Zhou, Li ; Jin, Da ; Wu, Peng",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122754,Journal Of Environmental Management

Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms On Plastic Wastes In An Estuarine Environment.,"Plastic wastes are ubiquitous in aquatic environment. Biofilms, which are often formed on the surface of plastic waste, may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs) and their associated microbial communities in biofilms formed on different types of plastic, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples taken from the Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) with visible biofilms were highly abundant, and the average absolute abundance of most tested ARGs in the biofilms was higher than that in the sediment and water, indicating that biofilms on plastics can act as a reservoir for ARGs. Moreover, the biofilms on PE had a higher relative abundance of ARGs, compared to those on other plastics, and Firmicutes on PE may be potential hosts for these ARGs. Furthermore, Bacillus , Mycobacterium and Pseudomonas may be multi-resistance genera on plastics, and tet A and tet W may have more potential hosts on PET and PP. Metals, total phosphorus and salinity may be the major environmental factors regulating ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics. The results provide new insights into evaluating the risks caused by plastic wastes and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics in estuarine environment. Unlabelled Image • ARG absolute abundance showed: biofilms on plastics > sediment > water. • Biofilms formed on PE had a higher relative abundance of ARGs. • Firmicutes showed significant correlations with sul 1 and tet A on PE. • Metals, TP and salinity may regulate the ARGs in biofilms on plastics.","Guo, Xing-Pan ; Sun, Xiao-Li ; Chen, Yu-Ru ; Hou, Lijun ; Liu, Min ; Yang, Yi",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140916,Science Of The Total Environment
Plastisphere Enrich Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potential Pathogenic Bacteria In Sewage With Pharmaceuticals.,"Microplastics (MPs) and pharmaceuticals are common emerging pollutants in sewage, and their coexistence may have more negative effects on the environments. This study chose tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP) and triclosan (TCS) to investigate the responses of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities on different MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)) biofilms (plastisphere). The adsorption capacity of three pharmaceuticals on PVC and PE decreased in the order of AMP > TC > TCS. PE was more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. MPs led to the increase of the total copies of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the sewage. Importantly, multidrug ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of TC and MPs led to higher risks of spreading ARGs and MGEs. In addition, potential pathogenic bacteria Legionella , Mycobacterium , Neisseria and Arcobacter were more abundant on plastisphere than those in sewage, and these bacteria might be the hosts for ARGs and MGEs. This study showed that plastisphere could be repositories of ARGs and MGEs in sewage and accumulated potential pathogenic bacteria. Unlabelled Image • The adsorption capacity of TC, AMP and TCS on PVC was higher than that of PE. • PE was corrupted by bacteria, and more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. • Co-occurrence of TC and MPs led to a higher risk of spreading ARGs and MGEs. • The potential pathogenic bacteria, ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere. • Legionella , Mycobacterium , Neisseria and Arcobacter might be the hosts for ARGs.","Wang, Zhiqi ; Gao, Jingfeng ; Zhao, Yifan ; Dai, Huihui ; Jia, Jingxin ; Zhang, Da",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144663,Science Of The Total Environment

Early And Differential Bacterial Colonization On Microplastics Deployed Into The Effluents Of Wastewater Treatment Plants.,"Microbial colonization of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems is a well-known phenomenon; however, there is insufficient knowledge of the early colonization phase. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been proposed as important pathways for MPs entry and transport in aquatic environments and are hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study aimed at characterizing bacterial communities in the early stage of biofilm formation on seven different types of MPs deployed in two different WWTPs effluents as well as measuring the relative abundance of two ARGs (sulI and tetM) on the tested MPs. Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA showed significant higher diversity of bacteria on MPs in comparison with free-living bacteria in the WWTP effluents. β-diversity analysis showed that the in situ environment (sampling site) and hydrophobicity, to a lesser extent, had a role in the early bacterial colonization phase. An early colonization phase MPs-core microbiome could be identified. Furthermore, specific core microbiomes for each type of polymer suggested that each type might select early attachment of bacteria. Although the tested WWTP effluent waters contained antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) harboring the sulI and tetM ARGs, MPs concentrated ARBs harboring the sulI gene but not tetM. These results highlight the relevance of the early attachment phase in the development of bacterial biofilms on different types of MP polymers and the role that different types of polymers might have facilitating the attachment of specific bacteria, some of which might carry ARGs. Unlabelled Image • Early colonization of seven types of microplastics in WWTP effluents was assessed. • In situ environment and hydrophobicity explained bacterial diversity. • An early colonization phase MPs-core microbiome was identified. • Each tested MP was found to select early attachment of specific bacteria. • MPs could act as vector of antibiotic resistance genes.","Martínez-Campos, Sergio ; González-Pleiter, Miguel ; Fernández-Piñas, Francisca ; Rosal, Roberto ; Leganés, Francisco",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143832,Science Of The Total Environment

Consumer Green Behaviour: An Approach Towards Environmental Sustainability.,"Latest report of NASA claims that planet average surface temperature has risen about 1.62°F since the late 19th century because of increased human‐made emissions into atmosphere. Due to recent COVID‐19 pandemic, this planet is getting relief from pollution, as Wright stated that the sudden fall in pollution is observed in India, a country having world's 30 most polluted cities, similarly Gohd stated that satellite track emissions drop over china during this coronavirus outbreak. These facts showing, human is responsible to increase the pollution in this planet, therefore current study aims to test a model which can help in changing consumer behavior into consumer green behavior. A significant trend has been observed towards the recognition of the strategic importance of protecting the environment by enforcing laws. These kind of efforts are in favor of reducing consumption of plastic bags, and the need for practical and rapid measures to reduce the amount of plastic waste has increased, especially nylon bags, has increased. However, plastic bags are still the most common and used by many individuals, who prefer them to others to put their needs and belongings and their various purchases, or to save their food and drink because of its ease. Data were collected from shoppers at Cyberjaya (Malaysia) and Bangkok (Thailand). Findings indicate that knowledge and attitude have a significant and positive impact on consumer green behavior; the study also identified that the ban on plastic bags also has a significant and positive influence on consumer green behavior. This more considerable influence shows the need for such governmental interventions to moderate consumers' environmentally unfriendly behavior, and we cannot merely rely on consumers' acknowledgement of understanding the danger.","Khan, Muhammad Shahid ; Saengon, Poramet ; Alganad, Amr Mohammed Nasser ; Chongcharoen, Duangkamol ; Farrukh, Muhammad",10.1002/sd.2066,Sustainable Development

Microplastics Combined With Tetracycline In Soils Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance In The Enchytraeus Crypticus Microbiome.,"Growing evidence suggests that microplastics can adsorb antibiotics and may consequently exacerbate effects on the health of exposed organisms. Our current understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil invertebrates is limited. This study aimed to investigate changes in the microbiome and ARGs in Enchytraeus crypticus following exposure to a soil environment that contained both microplastics and antibiotics. Tetracycline (TC), polyamide (PA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were used to construct microcosms of polluted soil environments (TC, PA, PVC, PA+TC, PVC+TC). The differences in microbiomes and ARGs were determined by bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results show that compared with the Control or microplastics alone treatments, TC was significantly accumulated in E. crypticus when exposed to TC alone or in combination with microplastics (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences about TC accumulation between TC, PA+TC, and PVC+TC treated E. crypticus (P > 0.05). Microplastics and TC significantly disturbed the microbial community, and decreased the microbial alpha diversity of E. crypticus (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between TC, microplastics and their combined exposure treatments, and no toxic synergies on the diversity of E. crypticus microbiome between tetracycline and microplastics in soil environment. All the treatments increased the diversity of ARGs in E. crypticus (39–49 ARGs vs. 25 ARGs of control). In particular, treatments combining PVC and TC or PA and TC exposure resulted in greater ARGs abundance than the treatments when E. crypticus was exposed to PVC, PA or TC alone. These results add to our understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on the ARGs and microbiome of soil invertebrates. Image 1 • Tetracycline and microplastics disturbed the microbial community in E. crypticus. • Tetracycline and microplastics decreased the microbial diversity of E. crypticus. • Tetracycline and microplastics facilitated the incidence of ARGs in E. crypticus.

Effects Of Long-Term Microplastic Pollution On Soil Heavy Metals And Metal Resistance Genes: Distribution Patterns And Synergistic Effects.,"Heavy metals (HMs) and microplastics (MPs) are two emerging factors threatening global food security. Whether long-term MPs pollution will affect the distribution of HMs and their resistance genes (MRGs) in soil is unknown. Here, metagenomic approach was used to decipher the fate of MRGs in cropland soils with long-term film MPs residues. Similar distribution pattern of MRGs was formed in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. A total of 202 MRG subtypes were detected, with resistance genes for Multimetal, Cu, and As being the most prevalent type of MRGs. MRGs formed a modular distribution of five clusters centered on MRGs including ruvB in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. MRGs also formed tight co-occurrence networks with mobile genetic elements (MGEs: integrons, insertions and plasmids). Redundancy analysis showed that HMs together with microbial communities and MGEs affected the distribution of MRGs in soil. Thirteen genera including Pseudomonas were identified as potential hosts for MRGs and MGEs. The research provides preliminary progress on the synergistic effect of HMs and MPs in affecting soil ecological security. The synergistic effect of MPs and HMs needs to be considered in the remediation of contaminated soils. [Display omitted] • Ni is the most polluted HMs in long-term film MPs-contaminated soil. • Similar distribution patterns of MRGs formed in long-term film MPs-contaminated soil. • Environmental factors jointly affected the distribution pattern of MRGs. • Thirteen genera identified as potential hosts for MRGs and MGEs. • The synergistic effect of MPs and HMs needs to be considered.","Wu, Changcai ; Song, Xianpeng ; Wang, Dan ; Ma, Yajie ; Ren, Xiangliang ; Hu, Hongyan ; Shan, Yongpan ; Ma, Xiaoyan ; Cui, Jinjie ; Ma, Yan",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115180,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety

Photoaging Processes Of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics Enhance The Adsorption Of Tetracycline And Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance.,"Microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and microorganism ubiquitously coexist in aquatic environments. MPs inevitably undergo photoaging processes in aquatic environments, affecting the interactions between MPs and antibiotics and the antibiotic resistance of microorganism. In this study, the impact of photoaging processes of MPs on their adsorption behavior of tetracycline (TC) and related formation of antibiotic resistance were investigated. It was found that the photoaging processes significantly increased the adsorption capacity of TC onto MPs, with the Q e increasing from 0.387 to 0.507 mg/g at 288 K and from 0.507 to 0.688 mg/g at 308 K. The site energy distribution (SED) analysis further confirmed that the enhanced adsorption capacity was attributed to more high-energy adsorption sites acquired from MPs photoaging processes. Moreover, the enhanced adsorption of TC further facilitated the formation of seven antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., tetA , tetB , tetC , tetD , tetE , tetG , tetK) when MPs adsorbed with TC was covered by biofilm. This study helps comprehensively understand the environmental behaviors of co-existing MPs, antibiotics and microorganisms, providing a theoretical basis for evaluating and mitigating their coexistence risks. [Display omitted] • The photoaging processes altered the physiochemical properties of MPs. • The aging processes increased the adsorption capacity of TC onto MPs. • More high-energy sites on aged PVC MPs resulted in a higher adsorption capability. • The enhanced adsorption of TC further facilitated the formation of antibiotic resistance. • The photoaging processes of MPs increase their risk of carrying pathogenic bacteria.","Tian, Yajun ; Zhu, Jianyu ; Ying, Chuhan ; Luo, Hongwei ; Zhang, Shoufeng ; Zhang, Liqiu ; Li, Renna ; Li, Jun",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137820,Chemosphere
"Accumulation Of Polyethylene Microplastics In River Biofilms And Effect On The Uptake, Biotransformation And Toxicity Of The Antimicrobial Triclosan.","The interaction of multiple stressors in freshwater ecosystems may lead to adverse effects on aquatic communities and their ecological functions. Microplastics (MPs) are a class of contaminants of emerging concern that can exert both direct and indirect ecotoxicological effects. A growing number of studies have investigated MPs-attached microbial communities, but the interaction between MPs and substrate-associated biofilm (i.e., on natural river substrates, such as stones and sediments) remains poorly studied. In this work, the combined effects of polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) with a particle size of 10–45 μm (2 mg/L) and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) (20 μg/L) were investigated on river biofilms through a short-term exposure experiment (72 h). To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of MPs and chemical contaminants in substrate-associated river biofilms were assessed. Different response parameters were evaluated, including (i) exposure assessment and ii) contaminants effects at different levels: bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), photosynthetic efficiency (Y eff), and leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAPA). Triclosan was accumulated in river biofilms (1189–1513 ng/g dw) alongside its biotransformation product methyl-triclosan (20−29 ng/g dw). Also, PE-MPs were detected on biofilms (168−292 MP/cm<sup>2</sup>), but they had no significant influence on the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of TCS. A moderate shift in bacterial community composition was driven by TCS, regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure (e.g., increased relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae family). Additionally, Y eff and EPS content were significantly disrupted in TCS-exposed biofilms. Therefore, the most remarkable effects on river biofilms were related to the antimicrobial TCS, whereas single PE-MPs exposure did not alter any of the evaluated parameters. These results demonstrate that biofilms might act as environmental sink of MPs. Although no interaction between PE-MPs and TCS was observed, the possible indirect impact of other MPs-adsorbed contaminants on biofilms should be further assessed. [Display omitted] • Between 10 and 17% of the suspended polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) were accumulated in biofilms. • Exposure to PE-MPs did not affect structural and functional parameters of biofilms. • The antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) was accumulated and transformed by biofilms regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure. • Bacterial community structure and function of biofilms was affected by TCS. • Co-exposure to PE-MPs did not influence the toxicity of TCS.","Castaño-Ortiz, J.M. ; Romero, F. ; Cojoc, L. ; Barceló, D. ; Balcázar, J.L. ; Rodríguez-Mozaz, S. ; Santos, L.H.M.L.M.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123369,Environmental Pollution
Size-Dependent Toxic Interaction Between Polystyrene Beads And Mercury On The Mercury Accumulation And Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Of Brackish Water Flea Diaphanosoma Celebensis.,"Due to their worldwide distribution and persistence, mercury (Hg), and nano- and microplastics (NMPs) pose major threats to global ocean ecosystems. Hg and NMPs co-exist in the ocean and can interact with each other. However, information on the toxicity of this interaction to marine biota remains limited. Thus, we investigated the toxicological interaction between HgCl 2 (Hg) and NMPs by studying the influence of different sizes of polystyrene beads (0.05-, 0.5-, and 6-μm) on Hg accumulation in the brackish water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis. The Hg adsorption capacity of NPs (0.05-μm) was higher than that of MPs (0.5- and 6-μm). Only the group co-exposed to both Hg and NPs showed increased Hg content in D. celebensis. Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and transcriptional modulation of transporter genes (ABCBs and ABCCs) were decreased by NMP exposure, particularly by NPs, suggesting MXR disruption by NPs. However, only the activity of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs; ABCCs) increased with Hg exposure and decreased upon NP+Hg co-exposure, indicating an important role of ABCC in Hg efflux. Furthermore, in vivo toxicity tests showed a synergistic toxic interaction between Hg and NPs on the reproduction of D. celebensis. Our findings suggest that NPs have the potential to enhance the toxicity of Hg, increasing Hg accumulation not only by serving Hg as a carrier but also by disrupting MXR. [Display omitted] • The Hg absorption capacity of NPs was higher than that of MPs. • D. celebensis co-exposed to Hg and NPs exhibited higher Hg accumulation. • Hg and NP co-exposure had synergistic effects on reproduction of D. celebensis. • NPs potentially enhance Hg toxicity by disrupting ABC transporter activity.","Yoo, Je-Won ; Lee, Youn-Ha ; Kim, Jihee ; Han, Seunghee ; Lee, Kyun-Woo ; Lee, Young-Mi",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117131,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety

Environmental Life Cycle Cost Assessment: Recycling Of Hard Plastic Waste Collected At Danish Recycling Centres.,"Abstract Recycling of plastic waste is promoted by the European Union as an important step toward a circular economy. Recovered plastic waste is a complex and heterogeneous material, and the impurities and/or untargeted polymers associated to plastic waste may affect the recycling process and potentially decrease the intended benefits. An environmental and financial assessment was conducted on one tonne of hard plastic waste collected at Danish recycling centres. Three management scenarios were considered: two mechanical recycling (a simpler and a more advanced configuration, namely sMR and aMR) and a feedstock recycling (FR) scenario based on conversion through pyrolysis. Scenario aMR provided the largest savings in the highest number of impact categories (including global warming potential) and total costs; scenarios sMR and FR provided smaller savings (or even burdens), depending on the environmental impact category considered. A scenario analysis evaluating the type of energy provision, location of recycling facilities and the application of the recycled material confirmed the ranking of results with respect to global warming potential and total costs. A global sensitivity assessment of model data inputs demonstrated that three to nine parameters were typically sufficient to achieve more than 90% of total variance of the results; critical parameters were mainly related to sorting efficiencies, technical yields and market substitution factors. The study demonstrates that if high quality of the recycled plastic is achieved, both environmental savings and financial revenues are possible.","Faraca, Giorgia ; Martinez-Sanchez, Veronica ; Astrup, Thomas F.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.014,"Resources, Conservation & Recycling"
Global Performance And Trends Of Research On Emerging Contaminants In Sewage Sludge: A Bibliometric Analysis From 1990 To 2023.,"The pervasive occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in sewage sludge (SWS) poses significant safety challenges concerning the processing, disposal, and secure application, ultimately jeopardizing both human health and the ecological environment. To comprehensively comprehend the evolutionary trajectories, present state, and research advancements in the field of ECs in SWS, a systematic was conducted, scrutinizing the annual publication quantity, disciplinary distribution, core authors, involved nations/regions, pertinent keywords, and citation status of 2082 research publications related to ECs in SWS from 1990 to 2023. The results indicate a substantial upward trajectory in the research literature pertaining to ECs in SWS. The study of ECs in SWS encompasses 78 disciplines, including Environmental Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Water Resources. China, Spain, and the USA ranked among the top three countries in terms of both total publications and citation frequency. The majority of publications were published in reputable high-impact journals such as Science of the Total Environment , Chemosphere , and Bioresource Technology. Based on high-frequency keywords, co-occurrence networks of keywords, and keywords burst analysis, it is found that the occurrence and environment behavior of ECs in SWS (ARGs, microplastics, PPCPs, and POPs), the detection and analytical methods, the impact on SWS treatment and disposal processes, and the accumulation and ecological risks in plants and soil during SWS land utilization, are the main research directions and hot topics in this field. In the future, the study of the impact of SWS treatment technologies on ECs removal is expected to receive increased research attention. [Display omitted] • A bibliometric analysis of emerging contaminants (ECs) in sewage sludge (SWS) was conducted. • The prominent research groups and journals were revealed. • ARGs and POPs were the research focus on ECs in SWS. • Future directions and corresponding challenges were provided.","Li, Zhonghong ; Yuan, Donghai",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116597,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety

Evidence From In Vitro And In Vivo Studies On The Potential Health Repercussions Of Micro- And Nanoplastics.,"Plastic is a synthetic or semisynthetic polymer with numerous physicochemical properties, and its fragmentation can give rise to microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). These particles can enter our ecosystem, where a process of constant degradation facilitates their dispersion and absorption by different species, affecting multiple organs and systems. The objective of this review was to provide an update on the potential health effects of MPs and NPs indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies have described the absorption of plastic particles of different sizes and have documented their proinflammatory effects and genotoxicity, which can lead to the structural alteration of cells. MPs and NPs have also been implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MPs and NPs can access organisms via dietary and respiratory pathways and through the epidermis. Their reported effects include: changes in microbiota and digestive enzyme production; inflammatory processes at respiratory level; circulatory and reproductive system disorders; and neurotoxicity, inducing behavioral changes. In vi tro and in vivo studies have evidenced detrimental effects in different organs and systems as a function of the dose, size, and chemical properties of plastic particles. Further research is warranted to determine the effects on human health of these particles at environmental doses. [Display omitted] • The annual production of plastic increased by 660% between 1976 and 2016. • MPs and NPs can access organisms via dietary, respiratory and epidermal pathways. • In vi tro and in vivo studies evidenced detrimental effects in different organs and systems. • Proinflammatory effects, genotoxicity, organic disorders, among others, have been documented.","González-Acedo, Anabel ; García-Recio, Enrique ; Illescas-Montes, Rebeca ; Ramos-Torrecillas, Javier ; Melguizo-Rodríguez, Lucía ; Costela-Ruiz, Víctor Javier",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130826,Chemosphere

Selective Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens On Polystyrene Microplastics In Landfill Leachate.,"Landfill leachate is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs). However, the enrichment characteristics of ARGs on MPs and the effect of MPs' presence on ARGs in surrounding leachates are little studied. Therefore, we investigated the differences of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), bacterial communities and pathogens on polystyrene MPs, in MPs-surrounding leachate and in control (leachate with the absence of MPs). The results revealed that ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs, which was similar in three types of leachate environments. The genes strB and bla TEM were maximally enriched and mefA , ermB , tetM and tetQ were slightly enriched on MPs, and the degree of ARGs enrichment increased with time during the 60 days of the experiment. Furthermore, compared to the leachate, MPs were observed to have the higher abundances of MGEs and distinct bacterial communities, both of which were closely associated with ARGs on MPs. Pathogens were distinct and more abundant on MPs compared to that in leachate, and 11 pathogens were identified as potential hosts for ARGs on MPs. Additionally, the presence of MPs (500 mg/L) induced few changes in ARGs' abundances, MGEs' abundances and bacterial communities in MP-surrounding leachate within 60 days. Overall, this study suggested that MPs could selectively enrich ARGs and pathogens from the surrounding environments, which promoted the understanding of the combined pollution properties of MPs and ARGs. Unlabelled Image • ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs, which were related to ARGs types and time. • The abundances of MGEs were higher on MPs than that in surrounding leachate. • Bacterial communities on MPs were distinct from that in surrounding leachate. • ARGs were closely related to MGEs and bacterial communities on MPs. • Pathogens were distinct and more abundant on MPs compared to that in leachate.","Shi, Jianhong ; Wu, Dong ; Su, Yinglong ; Xie, Bing",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142775,Science Of The Total Environment
Fate And Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Facility Vegetable Soil.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) coexist widely in farmland soils, but the fate and abundance of ARGs on MPs is rarely explored. In this study, high-throughput fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine ARGs on MPs in facility vegetable soil. The results indicated that when the particle size of the MPs was larger, the weathering was more serious, or the MPs came from soils with a long vegetable cultivation period, the levels of antibiotics and heavy metals on the MPs were higher. The distribution of the detected ARGs types on distinct MPs showed changes. Compared with weakly weathered MPs, the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes on strongly weathered MPs were decreased by 2.6% and 1.7%, while the detected sul -ARGs and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes were increased by 1.5% and 2.8%. Compared with smaller MPs, the detected MLSB and vancomycin resistance genes on larger MPs were decreased by 2.0% and 1.4%, while the detected fluoroquinolone, quinolone, florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amphenicol (FCA) resistance genes and sul -ARGs were increased by 1.2% and 1.0%. Compared with MPs in soil after three years of vegetable cultivation, the detected FCA resistance genes and sul -ARGs on MPs in soil after ten years of vegetable cultivation were decreased by 1.3% and 1.6%, while the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes were increased by 1.0% and 1.7%. This study suggests that MPs with larger size, stronger weathering or from soil after long-term vegetable cultivation adsorb more antibiotics and heavy metals and cause more mobile genetic elements, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance on the MPs. Unlabelled Image • ARG abundance on larger MPs was higher than on smaller MPs by increasing 98.8%–154.4% • ARG abundance on strongly weathered MPs exceeded weakly weathered MPs by 0–45.7% • ARG abundance on MPs after 10 planting years exceeded 3 planting years by 25%–148%","Lu, Xiao-Ming ; Lu, Peng-Zhen ; Liu, Xue-Ping",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136276,Science Of The Total Environment

The Future For Mediterranean Wetlands: 50 Key Issues And 50 Important Conservation Research Questions.,"Wetlands are critically important for biodiversity and human wellbeing, but face a range of challenges. This is especially true in the Mediterranean region, where wetlands support endemic and threatened species and remain integral to human societies, but have been severely degraded in recent decades. Here, in order to raise awareness of future challenges and opportunities for Mediterranean wetlands, and to inform proactive research and management, we identified (a) 50 key issues that might affect Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050, and (b) 50 important research questions that, if answered, would have the greatest impact on the conservation of Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050. We gathered ideas through an online survey and review of recent literature. A diverse assessment panel prioritised ideas through an iterative, anonymised, Delphi-like process of scoring, voting and discussion. The prioritised issues included some that are already well known but likely to have a large impact on Mediterranean wetlands in the next 30 years (e.g. the accumulation of dams and reservoirs, plastic pollution and weak governance), and some that are currently overlooked in the context of Mediterranean wetlands (e.g. increasing desalination capacity and development of antimicrobial resistance). Questions largely focused on how best to carry out conservation interventions, or understanding the impacts of threats to inform conservation decision-making. This analysis will support research, policy and practice related to environmental conservation and sustainable development in the Mediterranean, and provides a model for similar analyses elsewhere in the world.","Taylor, Nigel G. ; Grillas, Patrick ; Al Hreisha, Hazem ; Balkız, Özge ; Borie, Maud ; Boutron, Olivier ; Catita, Ana ; Champagnon, Jocelyn ; Cherif, Semia ; Çiçek, Kerim ; Costa, Luís T. ; Dakki, Mohamed ; Fois, Mauro ; Galewski, Thomas ; Galli, Alessandro ; Georgiadis, Nicholas M. ; Green, Andy J. ; Hermoso, Virgilio ; Kapedani, Rezart ; Lange, Manfred A.",10.1007/s10113-020-01743-1,Regional Environmental Change

How Anammox Responds To The Emerging Contaminants: Status And Mechanisms.,"Numerous researches have been carried out to study the effects of emerging contaminants in wastewater, such as antibiotics, nanomaterials, heavy metals, and microplastics, on the anammox process. However, they are fragmented and difficult to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effects on reactor performance and the metabolic mechanisms in anammox bacteria. Therefore, this paper overviews the effects on anammox processes by the introduced emerging contaminants in the past years to fulfill such knowledge gaps that affect our perception of the inhibitory mechanisms and limit the optimization of the anammox process. In detail, their effects on anammox processes from the aspects of reactor performance, microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and functional genes related to anammox and nitrogen transformation in anammox consortia are summarized. Furthermore, the metabolic mechanisms causing the cell death of anammox bacteria, such as induction of reactive oxygen species, limitation of substrates diffusion, and membrane binding are proposed. By offering this review, the remaining research gaps are identified, and the potential metabolic mechanisms in anammox consortia are highlighted. [Display omitted] • Anammox process is feasible for specific wastewater treatment containing emerging pollutants. • The effects of different emerging pollutants on anammox processes are summarized. • The metabolic mechanisms causing inhibition to anammox bacteria are proposed. • Molecular-level understanding of the inhibitory effect is important.","Wang, Ye ; Ji, Xiao-Ming ; Jin, Ren-Cun",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112906,Journal Of Environmental Management

"Selectively Enrichment Of Antibiotics And Args By Microplastics In River, Estuary And Marine Waters.","• The content of antibiotics and ARGs on PE was decreased with salinity. • PE MPs can selectively enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbe in various waters. • Bacterial community on PE MPs differed from surrounding water by antibiotics. • ARGs and bacterial diversity on PE MPs increased in river water. • Bacteria on PE MPs were more susceptible to antibiotics in marine water. The partition of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between the microplastics (MPs) and the surrounding water with various salinity are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that adsorption of antibiotics on MPs might cause a significant change of the structure of microbial communities, diversity and abundance of ARGs on MPs and this might be further affected by change of salinity. In this study, we investigated adsorption of four common antibiotics (sulfamerazine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and tylosin) to polyethylene (PE) MPs in river, estuary and marine waters, and the differences of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities on MPs and in the three waters. The results showed that MPs can enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbes from the surrounding water. Elevated salinity could reduce adsorption of antibiotics to MPs and the abundance of ARGs. For example, MPs can concentrate more antibiotics and ARGs in the fresh river water than in the estuary and the marine waters. In addition, ARGs and bacterial communities on MPs at various salinity were significantly different under the pressure of four antibiotics. On MPs, sul1, sulA/folP-01, tetA, tetC, tetX and ermE increased significantly but a few new ARGs such as sulA/folP-01 and tetA appeared. The structure of the bacterial communities on MPs was different from the surrounding water since some bacteria species found on MPs were barely detected in the surrounding water while some genera on MPs vanished after exposure to antibiotics. As the antibiotics adsorbed and the ARGs on MPs decreased with the water salinity, the structure of the communities on MPs thus varied with salinity change. These findings are important to understand the effects of MPs on the transport, fate and ecological risk of antibiotics and ARGs in different aquatic environments.","Wang, Shanshan ; Xue, Nana ; Li, Wenfeng ; Zhang, Daoyong ; Pan, Xiangliang ; Luo, Yongming",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134594,Science Of The Total Environment
Bpa And Its Analogues (Bps And Bpf) Modify The Expression Of Genes Involved In The Endocrine Pathway And Apoptosis And A Multi Drug Resistance Gene Of The Aquatic Midge Chironomus Riparius (Diptera).,"Many countries are limiting the use of bisphenol A (BPA) because evidence shows it is dangerous to human health and wildlife. For the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are proposed as safer alternatives. They have already been released into the aquatic environment without previously available information about their potential adverse effects. In this study, we compared the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF exposure to the expression profile of genes involved in the endocrine pathway (EcR and E74), ecdysone metabolism (Cyp18a1 and Shadow), apoptosis (DRONC) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 gene (MRP1) in the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera). The three toxicants increased Shadow expression, which is involved in ecdysone synthesis, but only BPF significantly altered Cyp18a1 , which is implicated in ecdysone degradation. BPS and BPF modified EcR and E74 expression; BPF upregulated the effector caspase DRONC. Furthermore, BPA significantly increased MRP1 expression. This study provides insights into the action of bisphenols at the molecular level and highlights the potential risks of BPS and BPF as BPA alternatives. Image 1 • The BPA analogous, BPS and BPF, are biologically active compounds that act as xenobiotics in C. riparius. • The physicochemical properties of BPS and 20E suggest a similar behaviour in their interaction with NRs. • The pro-apoptotic effect of BPS and BPF may be related to a reduced expression of MRP1. • BPA analogous affected the transcriptional activity and produced changes in apoptosis and stress processes in C. riparius. BPS and BPF are biologically active compounds triggering apoptosis and stress processes in Chironomus riparius.","Morales, Mónica ; De La Fuente, Mercedes ; Martín-Folgar, Raquel",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114806,Environmental Pollution

"Additive Genetic Variance For Traits Least Related To Fitness Increases With Environmental Stress In The Desert Locust, Schistocerca Gregaria.","Under environmental stress, previously hidden additive genetic variation can be unmasked and exposed to selection. The amount of hidden variation is expected to be higher for life history traits, which strongly correlate to individual fitness, than for morphological traits, in which fitness effects are more ambiguous. However, no consensual pattern has been recovered yet, and this idea is still debated in the literature. Here, we hypothesize that the classical categorization of traits (i.e., life history and morphology) may fail to capture their proximity to fitness. In the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, a model organism for the study of insect polyphenism, we quantified changes in additive genetic variation elicited by lifetime thermal stress for ten traits, in which evolutionary significance is known. Irrespective of their category, traits under strong stabilizing selection showed genetic invariance with environmental stress, while traits more loosely associated with fitness showed a marked increase in additive genetic variation in the stressful environment. Furthermore, traits involved in adaptive phenotypic plasticity (growth compensation) showed either no change in additive genetic variance or a change of moderate magnitude across thermal environments. We interpret this mitigated response of plastic traits in the context of integrated evolution to adjust the entire phenotype in heterogeneous environments (i.e., adaptiveness of initial plasticity, compromise of phenotypic compensation with stress, and shared developmental pathway). Altogether, our results indicate, in agreement with theoretical expectations, that environmental stress can increase available additive genetic variance in some desert locust traits, but those closely linked to fitness are largely unaffected. Our study also highlights the importance of assessing the proximity to fitness of a trait on a case‐by‐case basis and in an ecologically relevant context, as well as considering the processes of canalization and plasticity, involved in the control of phenotypic variation.","Chapuis, Marie‐Pierre ; Pélissié, Benjamin ; Piou, Cyril ; Chardonnet, Floriane ; Pagès, Christine ; Foucart, Antoine ; Chapuis, Elodie ; Jourdan‐Pineau, Hélène",10.1002/ece3.8099,Ecology & Evolution (20457758)

Comparison Of Methods For Quantitating Salmonella Enterica Typhimurium And Heidelberg Strain Attachment To Reusable Plastic Shipping Container Coupons And Preliminary Assessment Of Sanitizer Efficacy.,"Salmonellaserovars, one of the leading contributors to foodborne illness and are especially problematic for foods that are not cooked before consumption, such as fresh produce. The shipping containers that are used to transport and store fresh produce may play a role in cross contamination and subsequent illnesses. However, methods for quantitatively attached cells are somewhat variable. The overall goal of this study was to compare conventional plating with molecular methods for quantitating attached representative strains forSalmonellaTyphimurium and Heidelberg on reusable plastic containers (RPC) coupons, respectively. We attachedSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and serovar Heidelberg SL486 (parent and an antibiotic resistant marker strain) to plastic coupons (2.54 cm2) derived from previously used shipping containers by growing for 72 h in tryptic soy broth. The impact of the concentration of sanitizer on log reductions between unsanitized and sanitized coupons was evaluated by exposing attachedS. Typhimurium cells to 200 ppm and 200,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Differences in sanitizer effectiveness between serovars were also evaluated with attachedS. Typhimurium compared to attachedS. Heidelberg populations after being exposed to 200 ppm peracetic acid (PAA). Treatment with NaClO caused an average of 2.73 ± 0.23 log CFU ofS. Typhimurium per coupon removed with treatment at 200 ppm while 3.36 ± 0.54 log CFU were removed at 200,000 ppm. Treatment with PAA caused an average of 2.62 ± 0.15 log CFU removed forS. Typhimurium and 1.41 ± 0.17 log CFU forS. Heidelberg (parent) and 1.61 ± 0.08 log CFU (marker). Lastly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize cell attachment and coupon surface topography. SEM images showed that remaining attached cell populations were visible even after sanitizer application. Conventional plating and qPCR yielded similar levels of enumerated bacterial populations indicating a high concordance between the two methods. Therefore, qPCR could be used for the rapid quantification ofSalmonellaattached on RPC.","Shi, Zhaohao ; Baker, Christopher A. ; Lee, Sang In ; Park, Si Hong ; Kim, Sun Ae ; Ricke, Steven C.",10.1080/03601234.2016.1181905,"Journal Of Environmental Science & Health.

Transcriptional Activity Of Detoxification Genes Is Altered By Ultraviolet Filters In Chironomus Riparius.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters are compounds used to prevent the damage produced by UV radiation in personal care products, plastics, etc. They have been associated with endocrine disruption, showing anti-estrogen activity in vertebrates and altering the ecdysone pathway in invertebrates. Although they have attracted the attention of multiple research teams there is a lack of data about how animals activate detoxification systems, especially in invertebrates. Here, analysis of the effects of two UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), on the transcriptional activity of nine genes covering the three steps of the detoxification process has been performed. Four cytochrome P450 genes belonging to different members of this family, five GST genes, and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) gene were studied by RT-PCR to analyze their transcriptional activity in fourth instar larvae exposed to the UV filters for 8 and 24 h. The obtained results show a differential response with downregulation of the different Cyp450s tested by 4MBC while BP3 seems not to modify their expression. On the other hand, some of the GST genes were affected by one or other of the filters, showing a less homogenous response. Finally, MRP1 was activated by both filters but at different times. These results demonstrate for first time that UV filters alter the expression of genes involved in the different steps of the detoxification process and that they can be processed by phase I enzymes other than Cyp450s. They also suggest that UV filters affect biotransformation processes, compromising the ability of the individual to respond to chemical stress, so further research is needed to know the extent of the damage that they can produce in the resistance of the cell to chemicals.","Martínez-Guitarte, José-Luis",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.11.017,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety

Microbiome Enrichment From Contaminated Marine Sediments Unveils Novel Bacterial Strains For Petroleum Hydrocarbon And Heavy Metal Bioremediation.,"Petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals are some of the most widespread contaminants affecting marine ecosystems, urgently needing effective and sustainable remediation solutions. Microbial-based bioremediation is gaining increasing interest as an effective, economically and environmentally sustainable strategy. Here, we hypothesized that the heavily polluted coastal area facing the Sarno River mouth, which discharges >3 tons of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ∼15 tons of heavy metals (HMs) into the sea annually, hosts unique microbiomes including marine bacteria useful for PAHs and HMs bioremediation. We thus enriched the microbiome of marine sediments, contextually selecting for HM-resistant bacteria. The enriched mixed bacterial culture was subjected to whole-DNA sequencing, metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) annotation, and further sub-culturing to obtain the major bacterial species as pure strains. We obtained two novel isolates corresponding to the two most abundant MAGs (Alcanivorax xenomutans strain-SRM1 and Halomonas alkaliantarctica strain-SRM2), and tested their ability to degrade PAHs and remove HMs. Both strains exhibited high PAHs degradation (60–100%) and HMs removal (21–100%) yield, and we described in detail >60 genes in their MAGs to unveil the possible genetic basis for such abilities. Most promising yields (∼100%) were obtained towards naphthalene, pyrene and lead. We propose these novel bacterial strains and related genetic repertoire to be further exploited for effective bioremediation of marine environments contaminated with both PAHs and HMs. [Display omitted] • Highly polluted sediments' microbiome enriched for PAH- and HM-remediating bacteria. • Two new Alcanivorax and Halomonas strains isolated show high bioremediation yields. • Metagenome assembly unveiled their novel genomic assets for PAH and HM remediation. • Possible use for efficient bioremediation of sites mixedly polluted by PAHs and HMs.","Dell'Anno, Filippo ; Joaquim Van Zyl, Leonardo ; Trindade, Marla ; Buschi, Emanuela ; Cannavacciuolo, Antonio ; Pepi, Milva ; Sansone, Clementina ; Brunet, Christophe ; Ianora, Adrianna ; De Pascale, Donatella ; Golyshin, Peter N. ; Dell'Anno, Antonio ; Rastelli, Eugenio",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120772,Environmental Pollution

"Source, Occurrence, Migration And Potential Environmental Risk Of Microplastics In Sewage Sludge And During Sludge Amendment To Soil.","Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global pollutant. MPs research is mainly concentrated on water, with limited research on MPs in sewage sludge. MPs from various sources are collected into sewage and most of the MPs are trapped in the sludge during the sewage treatment process. Sludge is not only a sink of MPs, but also a source. Soil amendment with sludge provides nutrients into the soil, but it can also import substantial MPs into the soil, which has certain environmental risks. Therefore, we focused on the MPs in sludge and sludge-amended soil and conducted a literature review to summarize the sources, physical properties and fate of the MPs in sludge, as well as their separation, identification and statistical methods. MPs can accumulate in the soil, influence the properties of the soil, and also migrate, which might result in the pollution of deep soils and groundwater. In addition, the adsorption by MPs of heavy metals, organic pollutants, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes cannot be ignored as sewage sludge generally contains substantial concentrations of these pollutants. They can be adsorbed by the MPs and transferred into the soil with sludge amendment of soil. The combination and interaction of MPs with its adsorbed pollutants might increase environmental risk, further leading to possibility of them being uptaken by plants. The specific long-term risks to the environment caused by MPs in soil with sludge amendment require further exploration and investigation. Unlabelled Image • 60%–99% MPs from different sewage sources are detained in sludge. • Unified method for separation and statistical identification of sludge MPs required • MPs can adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants, antibiotics and ARGs. • MPs in sludge have stronger ability to adsorb pollutants than original MPs. • Soil amendment with sludge containing MPs carries potential environmental risks.","Gao, Ding ; Li, Xin-Yu ; Liu, Hong-Tao",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140355,Science Of The Total Environment
Incorporating Environmental Impacts Into The Economic Evaluation Of Health Care Systems: Perspectives From Ecological Economics.,"• Health care generates significant environmental impacts. • These include GHG emissions, air pollution, and plastic and pharmaceutical waste. • These are negative externalities and should be included in economic evaluations. • This can be achieved through the use of shadow prices in costs. • Environmental impacts of overuse and antimicrobial resistance need more attention. Health care is responsible for a range of negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, plastics waste, and pharmaceutical pollution of ecosystems through excretion and inappropriate disposal. Evidence on the scale of these impacts has been growing in high-income countries. To date, there has been only limited discussion of how environmental impacts might be incorporated into economic evaluations of health care programs, including health technology assessment. This paper considers why and how this aim might be achieved, using perspectives from both mainstream and ecological economics. There are strong arguments for using economic evaluation to internalise the negative environmental externalities currently being generated by health care, as well as precautionary arguments for health systems to better understand their exposure to their environmental impacts. The paper tests the feasibility of incorporating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions within costing for economic evaluation, and concludes that the use of shadow prices to achieve this aim is feasible. It suggests that this cost-based approach is preferable to more convoluted attempts to incorporate environmental impacts in the outcome component of health economic evaluations. The interaction between overuse, antimicrobial resistance and environmental harms of health care is identified as an area that would benefit from investigation using innovative economic methods.","Hensher, Martin",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104623,"Resources, Conservation & Recycling"
Short- And Long-Term Single And Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Chromium On The Freshwater Water Flea Daphnia Magna.,"• Exposure to MPs, Cr, and their combination caused significant deleterious effects and acute toxicity in D. magna. • Alterations in oxidative stress occurred in the groups treated with MPs and Cr alone and together. • Upon co-exposure to MPs, the Cr concentration, measured by ICP-OES, decreased, suggesting that MPs and Cr interact with each other. • A decrease in MP egestion via inhibition of P-gp activity in the MP-exposed groups, and MRP activity increased in some of the MP-exposed animals depending on Cr concentration. • MP exposure seemed to lead to the mitochondrial transcription dysfunction induced by Cr via sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study, we investigated the individual and combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and chromium (Cr) on the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna by measuring mortality, bioaccumulation, antioxidative response, multixenobiotic resistance activity, and sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis in short-term assays and in vivo endpoints including reproduction and adult survival rate in long-term assays. Exposure to MPs, Cr, and their combination caused significant deleterious effects and acute toxicity in D. magna. Alterations in oxidative stress occurred in the groups treated with MPs and Cr alone and together. However, upon co-exposure to MPs, the Cr concentration, measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, decreased, suggesting that MPs and Cr interact with each other. Based on enzymatic activities, we noted a decrease in MP egestion via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity in the MP-exposed groups, and multidrug resistance–associated protein activity increased in some of the MP-exposed animals depending on Cr concentration. On the other hand, MP exposure seemed to lead to mitochondrial transcription dysfunction induced by Cr via sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, these results indicate that co-exposure to MPs and Cr causes acute toxicity in D. magna but lacks the chronic toxicity (21 days) and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Cr exposure alone.","Jeong, Haksoo ; Lee, Young Hwan ; Sayed, Alaa El-Din H. ; Jeong, Chang-Bum ; Zhou, Bingsheng ; Lee, Jae-Seong ; Byeon, Eunjin",10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106348,Aquatic Toxicology
Optimizing The Bioplastic Chemical Building Block With Wastewater Sludge As The Feedstock Using Carbon-Hydrogen-Oxygen Framework.,"• Wastewater sludge is producing volatile fatty acid (VFA) for bioplastic production. • Resources are optimized by creating an atomic carbon-hydrogen-oxygen framework. • NLP model is used to form interception networks integrating different chemical plants. • A biochemical symbiotic network demonstrates the exchange of VFA in an EIP. • Extended CHON framework is recommended for high protein (N atom) wastewater. The ever-growing production of non-recyclable plastic products causes plastic pollution to be the one of most pressing environmental issues. The transition of petrochemical-based plastic with eco-friendly biodegradable plastic has become the promising solution to overcome the plastic pollution crisis. Recent research addressed the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which is a class of bioplastic through the valorisation of wastewater sludge. However, the high production cost and limited process feasibility studies hinder the commercialisation of the waste-derived PHA synthesis process. Since there is a lack of exploration on material integration by implementing an industrial symbiosis network that could potentially enhance the sustainability of waste-derived PHA production, this paper proposes the optimisation of bioplastic production by creating a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen industrial symbiosis network (CHOSYN) to solve sludge management and resources consumption problem concurrently. The atomic targeting approach is used to benchmark the resources and waste discharge from the model. The findings indicate that the proposed process framework attains sustainability improvement in economic and environmental aspects as compared to the conventional PHA synthesis process. An optimal biorefinery eco-industrial park (EIP) design with the involvement of PHA production is presented and the implication of results obtained is also discussed in this article.","Goh, Qi Hao ; Farouk, Amr A. ; Chew, Irenemei Leng",10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105920,"Resources, Conservation & Recycling"

Elevated Co2 Aggravated Polystyrene Microplastics Effects On The Rice-Soil System Under Field Conditions.,"Polystyrene microplastics (PS) are decomposed very slowly due to their recalcitrance and inevitably interact with the changing climate. How the interaction between PS and increasing CO 2 concentration affects the plant-soil system is rarely investigated. Here, a free-air CO 2 enrichment system in farm fields was used to study the impacts of PS added to soil at 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> on rice and soil bacterial communities at different CO 2 levels (ambient∼390 ppm and elevated∼590 ppm). Results showed that single PS interfered with Fe, Mn and Zn uptake of rice, and it increased the abundances of bacteria taxa assigned to N turnover and urease activities, leading to altered soil N transformation and availability. Elevated CO 2 alone enhanced rice photosynthesis, decreased the abundances of nitrogen-fixation bacteria, and induced co-occurrence patterns between bacteria simpliﬁed and decentralized. Combined PS and elevated CO 2 significantly decreased rice stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by 56.70% and 29.46%, respectively, and further inhibited elements uptake. Besides, combined exposure significantly disturbed bacterial amino acid metabolism, and stimulated the adaptative responses of resistant bacteria. Overall, this study revealed that increasing CO 2 concentrations may exacerbate the impacts of PS on rice performance and soil bacterial communities, providing new insights into the interaction between microplastics and climate change. [Display omitted] • PS interfered with rice nutrients uptake and soil N cycling. • Elevated CO 2 induced bacterial co-occurrence pattern simpliﬁed. • Elevated CO 2 aggravated PS effects on rice performance. • Elevated CO 2 exacerbated PS effects on soil bacterial function.","Xu, Meiling ; Xu, Qiao ; Wang, Guobing ; Du, Wenchao ; Zhu, Jianguo ; Yin, Ying ; Ji, Rong ; Wang, Xiaozhi ; Guo, Hongyan",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120603,Environmental Pollution
Interactions Of Microplastics And Soil Pollutants In Soil-Plant Systems.,"In recent years, increasing studies have been reported on characterization and detection of microplastics (MPs), and their interactions with organic pollutants (OPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in soils. However, a comprehensive review on the characteristics and factors that influence MPs distribution in soils, the sorption characteristics and mechanisms of soil contaminants by MPs, especially the interactions of MPs and their complexes with pollutants in the soil-plant systems remains rarely available at present. This review focuses on the sorption features and mechanisms of pollutants by MPs in soil and discussed the effects of MPs and their complexing with pollutants on soil properties, microbe and plants. The polarity of MPs significantly influenced the sorption of OPs, and different sorption mechanisms are involved for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic OPs. The sorption of OPs on MPs in soils is different from that in water. Aging of MPs can promote the sorption and migration of contaminants. The enhanced effects of biofilm in microplastisphere on the sorption of pollutants by MPs are critical, and interactions of soil environment-MPs-microbe-HMs-antibiotics increase the potential pathogens and larger release of resistance genes. The coexistence of HMs and MPs affected the growth of plants and the uptake of HMs and MPs by the plants. Moreover, the type, dose, shape and particle size of MPs have important influences on their interactions with pollutants and subsequent effects on soil properties, microbial activities and plant growth. This review also pointed out some knowledge gaps and constructive countermeasures to promote future research in this field. [Display omitted] • Aging of microplastics (MPs) promote sorption and migration of soil pollutants. • Soil organism, tillage, organic matter, texture affect MPs' vertical distribution. • Polarity of MPs significantly influences their sorption of organic pollutants. • MPs can be carrier of soil heavy metals (HMs) and alter the bioavailability of HMs. • Type, dose, shape and size of MPs influence their effects on soil-plant system.","He, Shanying ; Wei, Yufei ; Yang, Chunping ; He, Zhenli",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120357,Environmental Pollution
Between Source And Sea: The Role Of Wastewater Treatment In Reducing Marine Microplastics.,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a focal point for the removal of microplastic (MP) particles before they are discharged into aquatic environments. WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 μm, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers. • Despite high capture efficiency, treated wastewater is a source of microplastics. • Residual MP removal from treated wastewater is still at the experimental stage. • Innovation to enhance MP removal needs policy and regulation incentives. • Global governance frameworks for MP pollution are fragmented and uncoordinated.","Freeman, Shirra ; Booth, Andy M. ; Sabbah, Isam ; Tiller, Rachel ; Dierking, Jan ; Klun, Katja ; Rotter, Ana ; Ben-David, Eric ; Javidpour, Jamileh ; Angel, Dror L.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110642,Journal Of Environmental Management
Effects Of Microplastics (Mps) And Tributyltin (Tbt) Alone And In Combination On Bile Acids And Gut Microbiota Crosstalk In Mice.,"Microplastics (MPs) and tributyltin (TBT) are both potential environmental pollutants that enter organisms through the food chain and affect bodily functions. However, the effects and mechanisms of MPs and TBT exposure (especially the co-exposure of both pollutants) on mammals remain unclear. In this study, Ф5 μm MPs (5MP) was administered alone or in combination with TBT to investigate the health risk of oral exposure in mice. All three treatments induced inflammation in the liver, altered gut microbiota composition and disturbed fecal bile acids profiles. In addition to decreasing triglyceride (TG) and increasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and macrophage-expressed gene 1 (Mpeg1), 5MP induced hepatic cholestasis by stimulating the expression of the cholesterol hydroxylase enzymes CYP8B1 and CYP27A1, and inhibiting multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 3 (MRP2, MRP3), and bile-salt export pump (BSEP) to prevent bile acids for entering the blood and bile. Correspondingly, 5MP treatment decreased 7-ketolithocholic acid (7-ketoLCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA), which were positively correlated with decreased Bacteroides and Marvinbryantia and negatively correlated with increased Bifidobacterium. In addition, TBT increased interferon γ (IFNγ) and Mpeg1 levels to induce inflammation, accompanied by decreased 7-ketoLCA, tauro-alpha-muricholic acid (T-alpha-MCA) and alpha-muricholic acid (alpha-MCA) levels, which were negatively related to Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 and Bifidobacterium. Co-exposure to 5MP and TBT also decreased TG and induced bile acids accumulation in the liver due to inhibited BSEP, which might be attributed to the co-regulation of decreased T-alpha-MCA and Harryflintia. In conclusion, the administration of 5MP and TBT alone and in combination could cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and subsequently alter bile acids profiles, while the combined exposure of 5MP and TBT weakened the toxic effects of 5MP and TBT alone. [Display omitted] • Alone or co-exposure of Ф5 μm microplastics (5MP) and tributyltin (TBT) could induce inflammation in mice liver. • 5MP and co-exposure with TBT could cause liver cholestasis in mice. • Alone or co-exposure of 5MP and TBT cause gut microbiome and fecal bile acids dysbiosis, and they were significantly related. • The combined exposure of 5MP and TBT weakened the toxic effects of 5MP and TBT alone.","Jiang, Ping ; Yuan, Ge-Hui ; Jiang, Bao-Rong ; Zhang, Jing-Yi ; Wang, Yu-Qian ; Lv, Hui-Jie ; Zhang, Zhan ; Wu, Jia-Lin ; Wu, Qian ; Li, Lei",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112345,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety

The Travelling Particles: Investigating Microplastics As Possible Transport Vectors For Multidrug Resistant E. Coli In The Weser Estuary (Germany).,"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in aquatic environments has been a long withstanding health concern, namely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. Given increasing reports on microplastic (MP) pollution in these environments, it has become crucial to better understand the role of MP particles as transport vectors for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed where particles of both synthetic and natural material (HDPE, tyre wear, and wood) were sequentially incubated at multiple sites along a salinity gradient from the Lower Weser estuary (Germany) to the offshore island Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). Following each incubation period, particle biofilms and water samples were assessed for ESBL-producing E. coli , first by the enrichment and detection of E. coli using Fluorocult® LMX Broth followed by cultivation on CHROMAgar™ ESBL media to select for ESBL-producers. Results showed that general E. coli populations were present on the surfaces of wood particles across all sites but none were found to produce ESBLs. Additionally, neither HDPE nor tyre wear particles were found to harbour any E. coli. Conversely, ESBL-producing E. coli were present in surrounding waters from all sites, 64% of which conferred resistances against up to 3 other antibiotic groups, additional to the beta-lactam resistances intrinsic to ESBL-producers. This study provides a first look into the potential of MP to harbour and transport multidrug-resistant E. coli across different environments and the approach serves as an important precursor to further studies on other potentially harmful MP-colonizing species. Unlabelled Image • The role of microplastics as transport vectors for ESBL-producing E. coli was assessed through an incubation experiment. • E. coli communities were found on the surfaces of wood particles at all sites but did not produce ESBLs. • ESBL-producing E. coli found in surface waters at all sites, most abundantly in Helgoland waters.","Song, Jessica ; Jongmans-Hochschulz, Elanor ; Mauder, Norman ; Imirzalioglu, Can ; Wichels, Antje ; Gerdts, Gunnar",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137603,Science Of The Total Environment
"Silver Nanoparticles In The Environment: Sources, Detection And Ecotoxicology.","The environmental impact of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) has become a topic of interest recently, this is due to the fact that AgNPs have been included in numerous consumer products including textiles, medical products, domestic appliances, food containers, cosmetics, paints and nano-functionalised plastics.

These concerns have led to a number of studies investigating the release of particles from nano-functionalised products, the detection of the particles in the aquatic environment and the potential environmental toxicology of these AgNPs to aquatic organisms.

Meta-Analysis Reveals Differential Impacts Of Microplastics On Soil Biota.,"Contamination of microplastics (MPs) is a global environmental issue that has received much attention from the scientific and public communities due to ecological concerns in recent decades. Comparing with aquatic ecosystems, soil systems, regardless of the high importance and complexity, have been less studied under widely existing and increasing MP contamination. This review, combined with data assimilation and meta-analysis methods, has summarized current contamination conditions of soil MPs across different sites reported in earlier studies. While performing this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of MPs on soil biota including their numbers, biomass, diversity, and physiological properties. The results showed that abundance of soil MPs ranged from 0.34 to 410958.9 items kg<sup>-1</sup> and concentration ranged from 0.002 to 67500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> across sites, with agricultural soils containing significantly lower abundance and concentration of MPs than others. Presence of MPs significantly decreased the individual number of soil biota, operational taxonomic unit, diversity index (Simpson), movement index and reproduction rate, whereas the mortality rate was significantly increased by the soil MPs. Despite these significant effects, MPs did not significantly alter the biomass of soil biota, which could be due to a counteraction of their negative and positive effects on different groups of soil organisms. Moreover, we observed that soil MPs could significantly increase the Chao1 index, suggesting that MPs may act as a food resource for the soil rare biosphere. Based on the existing knowledge, we suggest that future studies should focus on research areas that include but are not limited to methodological improvements, intensive field investigations, risk assessment from the perspective of soil food web and bioaccumulation, MPs induced antibiotic resistance, and restoration strategies to reduce their concentrations in soil. [Display omitted] • Soil microplastics (MPs) abundance and concentration varied substantially among sites. • Agricultural soils contained lower MPs abundance and concentration than other ecosystems. • MPs decreased the number, diversity index, movement and reproduction rate of soil biota. • MPs significantly decreased soil faunal biomass but increased microbial biomass. • MPs may provide diverse habitats to feed more rare soil microbial species.","Wei, Hui ; Wu, Lizhu ; Liu, Ziqiang ; Saleem, Muhammad ; Chen, Xuan ; Xie, Jiefen ; Zhang, Jiaen",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113150,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety
"Microplastic Distributions In A Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant: Removal Efficiency, Seasonal Variation And Influence Of Sampling Technique.","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as an important route of microplastics (MPs) to the environment. Therefore, more effective MPs sampling and detection methodologies, as well as a better understanding of their influence on MPs occurrence and distributions in WWTP effluents, are needed for better removal and control. In this work, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs was assessed by collecting samples from raw to tertiary effluent during a 12-month sampling campaign (season-based) using different sampling methods (containers, 24-h composite and large grab samples). MPs retrieved from different treatment units within the WWTP were identified and quantified using plastic/non-plastic staining followed by optical microscopy, SEM and μ-Raman microscopy. Overall, the mean removal efficiency of MPs in the WWTP was 97%, with most MPs removed by the secondary stage and a mean effluent concentration of 1.97 MPs L<sup>−1</sup> after sand filtration. The relative abundance of particles was lower than fibers in treated effluent compared with the raw wastewater, with MP fibers constituting 74% of the total MPs in raw wastewater and 91% in treated effluent. Taking seasonal variations into account is important as total MPs concentration in the effluent was notably higher in winter compared with the other seasons. Increasing the sampled volume using large samples or 24-h composite samples significantly reduced the variability between replicates. However, MPs concentration post the tertiary stage was significantly lower using morning sampling (9 am) by large grab sampling method (1.2 MPs L<sup>−1</sup>) compared to 24-h composite sampling (3.2 MPs L<sup>−1</sup>) possibly due to intra-daily changes. Using a finer mesh size (0.45 μm) to capture MPs beyond the size range typically studied (≥20 μm) effectively doubled the number of MPs detected in the tertiary effluent and highlights the importance of standardizing sampling procedures. Unlabelled Image • Sampling method affects the amount of identifiable microplastics in wastewater. • Microplastics concentrations were higher in winter compared with other seasons. • Large or 24 h composite samples contributed to minimize variability between samples. • Lower cut off mesh size (0.45 μm vs ≥20 μm) doubled the number of detected MPs. • Despite removal efficiency of 97%, annual microplastics emissions are considerable.","Ben-David, Eric A. ; Habibi, Maryana ; Haddad, Elias ; Hasanin, Mahdi ; Angel, Dror L. ; Booth, Andy M. ; Sabbah, Isam",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141880,Science Of The Total Environment

Microplastics In The Environment: Interactions With Microbes And Chemical Contaminants.,"Microplastics (MPs) are contaminants of emerging concern that have gained considerable attention during the last few decades due to their adverse impact on living organisms and the environment. Recent studies have shown their ubiquitous presence in the environment including the atmosphere, soil, and water. Though several reviews have focused on the occurrence of microplastics in different habitats, little attention has been paid to their interaction with biological and chemical pollutants in the environment. This review therefore presents the state of knowledge on the interaction of MPs with chemicals and microbes in different environments. The distribution of MPs, the association of toxic chemicals with MPs, microbial association with MPs and the microbial-induced fate of MPs in the environment are discussed. The biodegradation and bioaccumulation of MPs by and in microbes and its potential impact on the food chain are also reviewed. The mechanisms driving these interactions and how these, in turn, affect living organisms however are not yet fully understood and require further attention. Unlabelled Image • Microplastics serve as carriers of microbial pathogens and toxic chemicals in the environment. • Partitioning coefficients from conventional and indirect models can explain chemical sorption on MPs. • Microplastics could provide a conducive environment for antibiotic resistant gene exchange. • Different pathways for microplastics accumulation in microbes are postulated. • Microplastics accumulation in microbes could pose an adverse effect on their growth and metabolism.","Mammo, F.K. ; Amoah, I.D. ; Gani, K.M. ; Pillay, L. ; Ratha, S.K. ; Bux, F. ; Kumari, S.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140518,Science Of The Total Environment
Bacterium-Phage Symbiosis Facilitates The Enrichment Of Bacterial Pathogens And Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In The Plastisphere,"The plastisphere, defined as the ecological niche for microbial colonization of plastic debris, has been recognized as a hotspot of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the interactions between bacteria and phages facilitated by the plastisphere, as well as their impact on microbial risks to public health, remain unclear. Here, we analyzed public metagenomic data from 180 plastisphere and environmental samples, stemming from four different habitats and two plastic types (biodegradable and nonbiodegradable plastics) and obtained 611 nonredundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 4061 nonredundant phage contigs. The plastisphere phage community exhibited decreased diversity and virulent proportion compared to those found in environments. Indexes of phage-host interaction networks indicated significant associations of phages with pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), particularly for biodegradable plastics. Known phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were involved in nutrient metabolism, antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation in the plastisphere, which contributed to enhanced competition and survival of pathogens and ARB hosts. Phages also carried transcriptionally active virulence factor genes (VFGs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and could mediate their horizontal transfer in microbial communities. Overall, these discoveries suggest that plastisphere phages form symbiotic relationships with their hosts, and that phages encoding AMGs and mediating horizontal gene transfer (HGT) could increase the source of pathogens and antibiotic resistance from the plastisphere.","Xia R., Yin X., Balcazar J.L., Huang D., Liao J., Wang D., Alvarez P.J.J., Yu P.",10.1021/acs.est.4c08265,Environmental Science And Technology
Bioplastic Accumulates Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes In Coastal Marine Sediments,"The oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic debris, and several studies have implicated plastic as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bioplastic is widely regarded as an environmentally friendly replacement to conventional petroleum-based plastic, but the effects of bioplastic pollution on marine environments remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first evidence that bioplastic accumulates antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in marine sediments. Biofilms fouling ceramic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) were investigated by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Four ARG groups were more abundant in PHA: trimethoprim resistance (TMP), multidrug resistance (MDR), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance (MLS), and polymyxin resistance (PMR). One MRG group was more abundant in PHA: multimetal resistance (MMR). The relative abundance of ARGs and MRGs were strongly correlated based on a Mantel test between the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices (R = 0.97, p < 0.05) and a Pearson's analysis (R = 0.96, p < 0.05). ARGs were detected in more than 40% of the 57 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) while MRGs were detected in more than 90% of the MAGs. Further investigation (e.g., culturing, genome sequencing, antibiotic susceptibility testing) revealed that PHA biofilms were colonized by hemolytic Bacillus cereus group bacteria that were resistant to beta-lactams, vancomycin, and bacitracin. Taken together, our findings indicate that bioplastic, like conventional petroleum-based plastic, is a reservoir for resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in coastal marine sediments.","Di Cesare A., Pinnell L.J., Brambilla D., Elli G., Sabatino R., Sathicq M.B., Corno G., O'Donnell C., Turner J.W.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118161,Environmental Pollution
"Understanding The Interplay Between Antimicrobial Resistance, Microplastics And Xenobiotic Contaminants: A Leap Towards One Health?","According to the World Health Organization, the two major public health threats in the twenty-first century are antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes. The reason for the global prevalence and the constant increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is owed to the steady rise in overall antimicrobial consumption in several medical, domestic, agricultural, industrial, and veterinary applications, with consequent environmental release. These antibiotic residues may directly contaminate terrestrial and aquatic environments in which antibiotic-resistance genes are also present. Reports suggest that metal contamination is one of the main drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, the abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes is directly connected to the predominance of metal concentrations in the environment. In addition, microplastics have become a threat as emerging contaminants because of their ubiquitous presence, bio-inertness, toughness, danger to aquatic life, and human health implications. In the environment, microplastics and AMR are interconnected through biofilms, where genetic information (e.g., ARGs) is horizontally transferred between bacteria. From this perspective, we tried to summarize what is currently known on this topic and to propose a more effective One Health policy to tackle these threats.","Piergiacomo F., Brusetti L., Pagani L.",10.3390/ijerph20010042,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
"Wastewater Plastisphere Enhances Antibiotic Resistant Elements, Bacterial Pathogens, And Toxicological Impacts In The Environment","Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles with a size <5 mm that have raised alarming concerns owing to their ecological and human health impacts. They are largely released into the environment through the dumping of plastic waste and wastewater from treatment plants, domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial sources. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are unable to remove micro and nano-sized plastic particles, which end up in the natural aquatic and terrestrial environment, causing multifaceted toxic impacts. Moreover, plastics in wastewater generate biofilm that potentially enriches antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs), antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), and bacterial pathogens, which can largely impact antibiotic resistance development among organisms in the environment and transfer to humans through the food chain. Therefore, the current review aims to highlight the potential role of wastewater plastisphere in the enrichment and dissemination of ARBs, ARGs, and potential bacterial pathogens through mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the environment. Further, the interaction of wastewater MPs with organic and inorganic contaminants and the associated ecological and human health impacts have been presented. Last but not the least, control strategies and future research perspectives on wastewater plastisphere are also highlighted.","Junaid M., Liu S., Liao H., Liu X., Wu Y., Wang J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156805,Science Of The Total Environment
"Interactions Of Microplastics, Antibiotics And Antibiotic Resistant Genes Within Wwtps","Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in atmosphere, soil, and water and have been characterized as contaminants of emerging concern. When exposed to these environments, MPs interact with the chemical compounds as well as the (micro)organisms inhabiting these ecosystems. This paper overviews the interactions and significant factors influencing the sorption process of antibiotics on MPs since distinct interactions are developed between MPs and antibiotics. The interplay between the MPs and the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) microbial hosts is presented and the important factors that may shape the plastisphere resistome are discussed. The interactions of MPs, antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were discussed with the aim to provide a perspective for better understanding of the role of WWTPs in bringing together MPs, antibiotics and ARB/ARGs and further as release points of MPs carrying antibiotics, and ARB/ARGs.","Syranidou E., Kalogerakis N.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150141,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastics Enhance The Prevalence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Sludge Digestion By Enriching Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Surface Biofilm And Facilitating The Vertical And Horizontal Gene Transfer,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs) are recognized as emerging contaminants and threats to global human health. Despite both of them being significantly detected in their “hotspots”, i.e., waste activated sludge (WAS), rare studies on how MPs affect ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in anaerobic sludge digestion are available. Herein, the fate of ARGs and ARB after exposure to MPs of three dosages (10, 30, and 80 particles/g-TS), three polymer types (LDPE, PET, and PS), and three branching extents (LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE) in anaerobic sludge digestion was investigated. Metagenomic results indicated that all variants of MPs resulted in an increase of the relative abundance of ARGs in the digester compared to the control. The abundance of ARGs demonstrated a dosage-dependent relationship within the range from 10 to 80 particles/g-TS, resulting in an increase from 4.5 to 27.9% compared to the control. Branching structure and polymer type influence ARG level in the sludge digester as well. Mechanism studies revealed that LDPE selectively enriched potential ARB and ARGs in the surface biofilm, possibly creating a favorable environment for ARB proliferation and ARG exchange. Furthermore, vertical transfer of ARGs was facilitated by LDPE through increasing bacterial cell proliferation accompanied by the enhancement of relevant functional genes. The elevated abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and ARGs-carrying plasmids also demonstrated that MGE-mediated horizontal transfer was promoted by LDPE at 80 particles/g-TS. This effect was compounded by increased oxidative stress, cell membrane permeability, and cell cohesion, collectively facilitating horizontal ARG transfer. Consequently, both vertical and horizontal transfer of ARGs could be concurrently promoted by LDPE an in anaerobic sludge digester.","Luo T., Dai X., Wei W., Xu Q., Ni B.-J.",10.1021/acs.est.3c02815,Environmental Science And Technology
Growth And Prevalence Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Microplastic Biofilm From Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluents,"It is accepted that Microplastic (MP) biofilms accumulates antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in water. ARB/ARGs and MPs are emerging pollutants of concern due to various associated health risks. The objective of this study was to 1) investigate the ARB community in a pilot-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, 2) to study and visualize the ARB/ARGs in MP biofilm grown in WWTP effluent and tap water, and 3) to analyze microplastic adherent ARB/ARGs in the biofilm and planktonic ARB/ARGs in the filtrate under controlled conditions. Results indicated the dominance of Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Bacillus among isolated ARB in WWTP effluent. Representative resistance strains were incubated in 300 mL water containing commercial polystyrene beads of 300550 μm diameter (MP) in a series of batch experiments. Microbiological, molecular, and microscopic analyses were performed by enumeration, 16srRNA, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM) techniques. The analyzed viable ARB indicated an increasing trend in MP biofilms between days 3 and 5. It further decreased on days 7 and 9. The prevalence of ARB in the filtrate and MP biofilm varied as a function of time and TOC level, while no significant impacts were observed for minor temperature variation, low antibiotic pressure, and increased MP mass with few exceptions. Relative abundance of ARGs (vanA, sul1) and integron integrase gene (intl1) in MP biofilm were significantly different across different TOC levels, time, and antibiotic pressure. ARGs and intl1 were detected in the MP biofilm in tap water and WWTP effluent on day 30.","Perveen S., Pablos C., Reynolds K., Stanley S., Marugán J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159024,Science Of The Total Environment
"Effects Of Coexistence Of Tetracycline, Copper And Microplastics On The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Manured Soil","The coexistence of antibiotics, heavy metals and microplastics is becoming commonplace and may affect antibiotic resistance in manured soil. The current understanding of the role of microplastics in soil with combined pollution of antibiotics, heavy metals and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is limited. Here, the effects of the coexistence of tetracycline (TC), Cu and environmental microplastics (EM) on the fate of nine ARGs and three heavy metal resistance genes in agricultural soil were investigated by batch and microcosm experiments. EM were obtained by exposing virgin microplastics to soil environments for 80 days, which exhibited higher adsorption affinity for Cu and TC than soil particles and virgin microplastics. 1% EM in soil increased bioavailable concentrations of TC and Cu by 79–138% and 88–135%, respectively, and decreased TC dissipation from 11.79 mg kg(−1) to 3.08 mg kg(−1). Correspondingly, the total relative abundances of target ARGs increased by 219–348%. The significant correlations of tetG, tetB, tetQ, sul2, sul1 and intl1 with bioavailable fractions of TC and Cu in soil environments were revealed by network analysis. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs showed the special plastisphere around EM. Attributed to the biofilm generation and higher pollutant accumulation in the plastisphere, EM could be the source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ARGs in soil environments. Structure equation models further identified that indirect effects of EM acted a major role in the propagation of ARGs by altering soil properties, soil microbial diversity and intl1 abundance. This study revealed that EM could increase the stimulative effects of Cu and TC on antibiotic resistance and magnify the environmental risk of manure application in soil environments.","Wang Y., Wang X., Li Y., Liu Y., Sun Y., Xia S., Zhao J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148087,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastics Accumulate Priority Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens: Evidence From The Riverine Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) might accumulate and transport antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in aquatic systems. We determined the abundance and diversity of culturable ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria in biofilms covering MPs placed in river water, and characterized priority pathogens from these biofilms. Our results showed that the abundance of ARB colonizing MPs tends to be higher compared to sand particles. Also, higher numbers were cultivated from a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), compared to PP and PET alone. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas isolates were the most frequently retrieved from MPs placed before a WWTP discharge while Enterobacteriaceae dominated the culturable plastisphere 200 m after the WWTP discharge. Ciprofloxacin- and/or cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 54 unique isolates) were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 9), Enterobacter spp. (n = 4) and Shigella sp. (n = 1). All isolates presented at least one of the virulence features tested (i.e. biofilm formation, haemolytic activity and production of siderophores), 70% carried the intI1 gene and 85% exhibited a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [aacA4-cr (40% of the isolates), qnrS (30%), qnrB (25%), and qnrVC (8%)], along with mutations in gyrA (70%) and parC (72%). Cefotaxime-resistant strains (n = 23) harbored bla(CTX-M) (70%), bla(TEM) (61%) and bla(SHV) (39%). Among CTX-M producers, high-risk clones of E. coli (e.g. ST10 or ST131) and K. pneumoniae (ST17) were identified, most of which carrying bla(CTX-M-15). Ten out of 16 CTX-M producers were able to transfer bla(CTX-M) to a recipient strain. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the riverine plastisphere, harboring ARGs of clinical concern and exhibiting virulence traits, suggesting a contribution of MPs to the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens. The type of MPs and especially water contamination (e.g. by WWTPs discharges) seem to determine the resistome of the riverine plastisphere.","Silva I., Rodrigues E.T., Tacão M., Henriques I.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121995,Environmental Pollution
Knowledge Gaps In The Assessment Of Antimicrobial Resistance In Surface Waters,"The spread of antibiotic resistance in the water environment has been widely described. However, still many knowledge gaps exist regarding the selection pressure from antibiotics, heavy metals and other substances present in surface waters as a result of anthropogenic activities, as well as the extent and impact of this phenomenon on aquatic organisms and humans. In particular, the relationship between environmental concentrations of antibiotics and the acquisition of ARGs by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria as well as the impact of heavy metals and other selective agents on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) need to be defined. Currently, established safety values are based on the effects of antibiotic toxicity neglecting the question of AMR spread. In turn, risk assessment of antibiotics in waterbodies remains a complex question implicating multiple variables and unknowns reinforced by the lack of harmonized protocols and official guidelines. In the present review, we discussed current state-of-the-art and the knowledge gaps related to pressure exerted by antibiotics and heavy metals on aquatic environments and their relationship to the spread of AMR. Along with this latter, we reflected on (i) the risk assessment in surface waters, (ii) selective pressures contributing to its transfer and propagation and (iii) the advantages of metagenomics in investigating AMR. Furthermore, the role of microplastics in co-selection for metal and antibiotic resistance, together with the need for more studies in freshwater are highlighted.","Niegowska M., Sanseverino I., Navarro A., Lettieri T.",10.1093/femsec/fiab140,Fems Microbiology Ecology
Emerging Issues On Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Colonizing Plastic Waste In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) adhesion onto plastic substrates is a potential threat to environmental and human health. This current research investigates the prevalence of two relevant human pathogens, Staphylococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp., and their sophisticated equipment of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), retrieved from plastic substrates submerged into an inland water body. The results of microbiological analysis on selective and chromogenic media revealed the presence of colonies with distinctive phenotypes, which were identified using biochemical and molecular methods. 16S rDNA sequencing and BLAST analysis confirmed the presence of Klebsiella spp., while in the case of Staphylococcus spp., 63.6% of strains were found to be members of Lysinibacillus spp., and the remaining 36.3% were identified as Exiguobacterium acetylicum. The Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion assay was performed to test the susceptibility of the isolates to nine commercially available antibiotics, while the genotypic resistant profile was determined for two genes of class 1 integrons and eighteen ARGs belonging to different classes of antibiotics. All isolated bacteria displayed a high prevalence of resistance against all tested antibiotics. These findings provide insights into the emerging risks linked to colonization by potential human opportunistic pathogens on plastic waste commonly found in aquatic ecosystems.","Ferheen I., Spurio R., Marcheggiani S.",10.3390/antibiotics13040339,Antibiotics

"Selective Colonization Of Microplastics, Wood And Glass By Antimicrobial-Resistant And Pathogenic Bacteria","The Plastisphere is a novel niche whereby microbial communities attach to plastic debris, including microplastics. These communities can be distinct from those found in the surrounding environment or those attached to natural substrates and may serve as a reservoir of both pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. Owing to the frequent omission of appropriate comparator particles (e.g. natural substrates) in previous studies, there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting the unique risks posed by microplastics in terms of enrichment and spread of AMR pathogens. This study investigated selective colonization by a sewage community on environmentally sampled microplastics with three different polymers, sources and morphologies, alongside natural substrate (wood), inert substrate (glass) and free-living/planktonic community controls. Culture and molecular methods (quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)) were used to ascertain phenotypic and genotypic AMR prevalence, respectively, and multiplex colony PCR was used to identify extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPECs). From this, polystyrene and wood particles were found to significantly enrich AMR bacteria, whereas sewage-sourced bio-beads significantly enriched ExPECs. Polystyrene and wood were the least smooth particles, and so the importance of particle roughness on AMR prevalence was then directly investigated by comparing the colonization of virgin vs artificially weathered polyethylene particles. Surface weathering did not have a significant effect on the AMR prevalence of colonized particles. Our results suggest that the colonization of plastic and non-plastic particles by AMR and pathogenic bacteria may be enhanced by substrate-specific traits.","Stevenson E.M., Rushby-Jones O., Buckling A., Cole M., Lindeque P.K., Murray A.K.",10.1099/mic.0.001506,Microbiology (United Kingdom)
Microplastics Aided Augmentation Of Antibiotic Resistance In Wwtps: A Global Concern,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment are the major subject of concern across the globe as they jeopardize not only aquatic life but human health as well. MPs are potentially competent to adsorb various micropollutants (heavy metals), bacterial communities, and biofilm formation which comply with the requirement of efficient sorption of antibiotics and transfer of ARGs. MPs adsorb antibiotics through physicochemical interactions, leading to the formation of biofilm-enriched bacteria on the surfaces of MPs that further enhances the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and facilitates their dispersal. Therefore, this review recapitulates the interactive forces responsible for antibiotics sorption on MPs and also the intricate relationship between MPs, antibiotics, and microbial hosts of ARGs. Furthermore, the role of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which serve as a formidable connecting link between MPs and the ecosystem, is discussed in relation to dissemination of antibiotics, ARGs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) to get a clear perception of the contribution of WWTPs in drawing together MPs with antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs.","Rajput M., Mathur N., Singh A., Bhatnagar P.",10.1007/s11270-024-07326-8,"Water, Air, And Soil Pollution"
New Insight Into The Effect Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance And Bacterial Community Of Biofilm,"Microplastics (MPs) could serve as substrates for microbial colonization and biofilm formation. However, research on the effects of different types of microplastics and natural substrates on biofilm formation and community structure in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) is limited. In this study, we employed by means of microcosm experiments to analyze the situation of biofilms conditions, bacterial resistance patterns, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) distribution, and bacterial community on different substrates using microbial cultivation, high throughtput sequencing and PCR. The result showed that biofilms on different substrates markedly increased with time, with MPs surfaces formed more biofilm than stone. Analyses of antibiotic resistant showed negligible differences in the resistance rate to the same antibiotic at 30 d, but tetB would be selectively enriched on PP and PET. The microbial communities associated with biofilms on MPs and stones exhibited variations during different stages of formation. Notably, phylum WPS-2 and Epsilonbacteraeota were identified as the dominant microbiomes of biofilms on MPs and stones at 30 d, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that WPS-2 could potentially be a tetracycline-resistant bacterium, while Epsilonbacteraeota did not correlate with any detected ARB. Our results emphasized the potential threat posed by MPs as attachment carriers for bacteria, particularly ARB, in aquatic environments.","Li Y.-Q., Zhang C.-M., Yuan Q.-Q., Wu K.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139151,Chemosphere
Potential Risks Of Microplastics Combined With Superbugs: Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria On The Surface Of Microplastics In Mariculture System,"Microplastics have become emerging pollutants and served as potential vectors for harmful bacteria, while rare information on the emergency and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on the surface of microplastics is available. This study investigated the enrichment of ARB, especially multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria (MARB), on the surface of microplastics in mariculture system. Polyethylene terephthalate accounted for the highest proportion (75%) in the collected microplastics. The counts of cultivable ARB in microplastic samples were 6.40 × 10(6)–2.48 × 10(8) cfu/g, which were 100–5000 times higher than those in water samples. The ratios of cultivable ARB to total cultivable bacteria from microplastic samples were higher than those from water samples. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and abundance of cultivable ARB in the microplastic samples was high with the predominant bacterial genera of Vibrio, Muricauda and Ruegeria. Total 160 MARB isolates were obtained and most of isolates were obtained from the microplastic samples. MARB isolates resisting or intermediating to four and three antibiotics accounted for much higher proportions in the microplastic samples, and the higher percentage of antibiotic resistance was to penicillin, sulfafurazole, erythromycin and tetracycline. The dominant multiple antibiotic resistance profile was TET-SFX-ERY-PEN, which accounted for 25.4% in microplastic samples and 23.9% in water samples. In typical MARB isolates, the positive detection rate of ARGs was up to 80.0% in microplastic samples while that was 65.3% in water samples. Five types of class 1 integrons (intI1) associated gene cassette arrays and seven types of gene cassettes were detected in microplastic samples, which were more than those in water samples. These results revealed that microplastics were hazardous pollutants for the enrichment of ARB, especially superbugs, and the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Zhang Y., Lu J., Wu J., Wang J., Luo Y.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109852,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Microplastic Biofilms Promote The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Estuarine Environments,"As emerging pollutants, microplastics can aggregate microorganisms on their surfaces and form biofilms, enriching antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Consequently, microplastic biofilms have become a focal point of research. Horizontal gene transfer is one of the primary mechanisms by which bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance, with much of the research focusing on suspended bacteria. However, microplastic biofilms, as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer, also merit significant investigation. This study primarily explored and compared the frequency of ARG conjugative transfer between suspended bacteria and microplastic biofilms. The results demonstrated that, compared to suspended bacteria, microplastic biofilms enhanced the frequency of ARG conjugative transfer by 7.2–19.6 times. Among them, biofilms on polyethylene microplastics showed the strongest promotion of conjugation. After the formation of microplastic biofilms, there was a significant increase in bacterial density within the biofilms, which raised the collision frequency of donor and recipient bacteria. Then microplastic biofilms facilitated the gene expression levels of outer membrane proteins, enhanced bacterial gene transfer capabilities, promoted the synthesis of conjugative pili, accelerated the formation of conjugative pairing systems, and elevated the expression levels of genes related to DNA replication and transfer systems, thereby enhancing the conjugative transfer of ARGs within microplastic biofilms. Among different types of microplastic biofilms, polyethylene biofilms exhibited the highest bacterial density, thus showing the highest frequency of ARG conjugation. This study highlights the risks associated with ARG conjugative transfer following the formation of microplastic biofilms and provides insights into the risks of microplastic and antibiotic resistance propagation in estuarine environments.","Zhou Y., Zhang G., Zhang D., Zhu N., Bo J., Meng X., Chen Y., Qin Y., Liu H., Li W.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106777,Marine Environmental Research
"Microplastic Biofilms In Water Treatment Systems: Fate And Risks Of Pathogenic Bacteria, Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, And Antibiotic Resistance Genes","Microplastics (MPs) biofilms in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants (DWTPs and WWTPs) have gained increasing attention due to their potential to come into close contact with humans. This review examines the fate of pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in MP biofilms and their impacts on operations in DWTPs and WWTPs, as well as the associated microbial risks for ecology and human health. The literature shows that pathogenic bacteria, ARBs, and ARGs with high resistance can persist on MP surfaces and may escape treatment plants, contaminating drinking and receiving water. Nine potential pathogens, ARB, and ARGs can be retained in DWTPs and sixteen in WWTPs. While MP biofilms can improve the removal of MPs themselves, as well as the associated heavy metals and antibiotic compounds, they can also induce biofouling, hinder the effectiveness of chlorination and ozonation, and cause the formation of disinfection by-products. Furthermore, the operation-resistant pathogenic bacteria, ARB, and ARGs on MPs may have adverse impacts on receiving ecosystems, as well as human health, including a range of human diseases, from skin infections to pneumonia and meningitis. Given the significant implications of MP biofilms for aquatic ecosystems and human health, further research is necessary on the disinfection resistance of microbial populations in MP biofilm. This study provides valuable insights into the comprehensive understanding of the changes of MP biofilms in water and wastewater treatment systems as well as their impacts on ecology and human health.","Nguyen H.T., Lee Y.K., Kwon J.-H., Hur J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164523,Science Of The Total Environment

We present a plastisphere case study from Reunion Island, a remote oceanic island located in the Southwest Indian Ocean, polluted by plastics. We characterized the plastic pollution on the island's coastal waters, described the associated microbiome, explored viable bacterial flora and the presence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria. Reunion Island faces plastic pollution with up to 10,000 items/km(2) in coastal water. These plastics host microbiomes dominated by Proteobacteria (80 %), including dominant genera such as Psychrobacter, Photobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio. Culturable microbiomes reach 10(7) CFU/g of microplastics, with dominance of Exiguobacterium and Pseudomonas. Plastics also carry AMR bacteria including β-lactam resistance.

Synergistic Effects Of Antimicrobial Peptide Dp7 Combined With Antibiotics Against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria present a great threat to public health. In this study, the synergistic effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antibiotics on several multidrug-resistant bacterial strains were studied, and their synergistic effects on azithromycin (AZT)-resistance genes were analyzed to determine the relationships between antimicrobial resistance and these synergistic effects. A checkerboard method was used to evaluate the synergistic effects of AMPs (DP7 and CLS001) and several antibiotics (gentamicin, vancomycin [VAN], AZT, and amoxicillin) on clinical bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli). The AZT-resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, mefA, and msrA) were identified in the resistant strains using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. For all the clinical isolates tested that were resistant to different antibiotics, DP7 had high antimicrobial activity (≤32 mg/L). When DP7 was combined with VAN or AZT, the effect was most frequently synergistic. When we studied the resistance genes of the AZT-resistant isolates, the synergistic effect of DP7-AZT occurred most frequently in highly resistant strains or strains carrying more than two AZT-resistance genes. A transmission electron microscopic analysis of the S. aureus strain synergistically affected by DP7-AZT showed no noteworthy morphological changes, suggesting that a molecular-level mechanism plays an important role in the synergistic action of DP7-AZT. AMP DP7 plus the antibiotic AZT or VAN is more effective, especially against highly antibiotic-resistant strains.","Wu X., Li Z., Li X., Tian Y., Fan Y., Yu C., Zhou B., Liu Y., Xiang R., Yang L.",10.2147/DDDT.S107195,"Drug Design, Development And Therapy"

Plastiome: Plastisphere-Enriched Mobile Resistome In Aquatic Environments,"Aquatic microplastics (MPs) act as reservoirs for microbial communities, fostering the formation of a mobile resistome encompassing diverse antibiotic (ARGs) and biocide/metal resistance genes (BMRGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This collective genetic repertoire, referred to as the “plastiome,” can potentially perpetuate environmental antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our study examining two Japanese rivers near Tokyo revealed that waterborne MPs are primarily composed of polyethylene and polypropylene fibers and sheets of diverse origin. Clinically important genera like Exiguobacterium and Eubacterium were notably enriched on MPs. Metagenomic analysis uncovered a 3.46-fold higher enrichment of ARGs on MPs than those in water, with multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs) and BMRGs prevailing, particularly within MPs. Specific ARG and BMRG subtypes linked to resistance to vancomycin, beta-lactams, biocides, arsenic, and mercury showed selective enrichment on MPs. Network analysis revealed intense associations between host genera with ARGs, BMRGs, and MGEs on MPs, emphasizing their role in coselection. In contrast, river water exhibited weaker associations. This study underscores the complex interactions shaping the mobile plastiome in aquatic environments and emphasizes the global imperative for research to comprehend and effectively control AMR within the One Health framework.","Guruge K.S., Goswami P., Kanda K., Abeynayaka A., Kumagai M., Watanabe M., Tamamura-Andoh Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134353,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Promotion Of Antibiotic-Resistant Genes Dissemination By The Micro/Nanoplastics In The Gut Of Snail Achatina Fulica,"Terrestrial animal intestines are hotspots for the enrichment of micro/nano plastics (M/NPs) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs). However, little is known about the further impact of M/NPs on the spread of ARGs in animal guts. This study investigates the role of M/NPs (polystyrene) with varying particle sizes (0.082, 42, and 182 μm), concentrations (10 and 100 mg/L), and exposure durations (4 and 16 days) in the ARGs dissemination via conjugation in the edible snail (Achatina fulica) gut. Combination of qPCR with 16S rRNA-based sequencing, we found that PS exposure caused intestinal cell impairment and shifts in the gut microbial community of snails. Conjugation rate increased with PS particle sizes in the snail gut. After 4 days of exposure, significantly higher conjugation rates were observed in the gut exposed to 100 mg/L PS compared to 10 mg/L, however, this trend reversed after 16 days. Consistently, the abundances of conjugation relevant genes trfA and trbB shared similar trends to the conjugation ratios in the snail gut after PS exposure. Transconjugant diversity was much lower in 10 mg/L PS groups than in 100 mg/L PS treatments. Therefore, this study suggests that the presence of M/NPs would complicate management of ARG spread. The selection pressure exerted by M/NPs may sustain or even amplify the spread of ARGs in the gut of terrestrial animals even in the absence of antibiotics. It highlights the necessity of avoiding M/NPs intake as a part of comprehensive strategy for cubing ARG dissemination in the gut of animals.","Da Y.-M., Yang X.-R., Li M.-J., Li S.-S., Gao Z.-P., Zhang Y., Su J.-Q., Zhou G.-W.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176829,Science Of The Total Environment
Identifying Macroplastic Pathobiomes And Antibiotic Resistance In A Subtropical Fish Farm,"Macroplastics are ubiquitous in aquaculture ecosystems. However, to date the potential role of plastics as a support for bacterial biofilm that can include potential human pathogenic bacteria (PHPB) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) has been largely overlooked. In this study, we used a combination of metabarcoding and standard antibiotic susceptibility testing to study the pathobiome and resistome of macroplastics, fish guts and the environment in a marine aquaculture farm in Mauritius. Aquaculture macroplastics were found to be higher in PHPB, dominated by the Vibrionaceae family (0.34 % of the total community), compared with environmental samples. Moreover, isolates from aquaculture plastics showed higher significant multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) compared to non-plastic samples of seawater, sediment and fish guts. These results suggest that plastics act as a reservoir and fomite of PHPB and ARB in aquaculture, potentially threatening the health of farmed fish and human consumers.","Naudet J., D'Orbcastel E.R., Bouvier T., Godreuil S., Dyall S., Bouvy S., Rieuvilleneuve F., Restrepo-Ortiz C.X., Bettarel Y., Auguet J.-C.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115267,Marine Pollution Bulletin
"Research Progress On The Origin, Fate, Impacts And Harm Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wastewater Treatment Plants","Previous studies reported microplastics (MPs), antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). There is still a lack of research progress on the origin, fate, impact and hazards of MPs and ARGs in WWTPs. This paper fills a gap in this regard. In our search, we used ""microplastics"", ""antibiotic resistance genes"", and ""wastewater treatment plant"" as topic terms in Web of Science, checking the returned results for relevance by examining paper titles and abstracts. This study mainly explores the following points: (1) the origins and fate of MPs, antibiotics and ARGs in WWTPs; (2) the mechanisms of action of MPs, antibiotics and ARGs in sludge biochemical pools; (3) the impacts of MPs in WWTPs and the spread of ARGs; (4) and the harm inflicted by MPs and ARGs on the environment and human body. Contaminants in sewage sludge such as MPs, ARGs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria enter the soil and water. Contaminants can travel through the food chain and thus reach humans, leading to increased illness, hospitalization, and even mortality. This study will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of action among MPs, antibiotics, ARGs, and the harm they inflict on the human body.","Zhao K., Li C., Li F.",10.1038/s41598-024-60458-z,Scientific Reports
Microplastics Exacerbate Co-Occurrence And Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Microplastic pollution is a rising environmental issue worldwide. Microplastics can provide a niche for the microbiome, especially for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could increase the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the interactions between microplastics and ARGs are still indistinct in environmental settings. Microplastics were found to be significantly correlated with ARGs (p < 0.001), based on the analysis of samples taken from a chicken farm and its surrounding farmlands. Analysis of chicken feces revealed the highest abundance of microplastics (14.9 items/g) and ARGs (6.24 ×10(8) copies/g), suggesting that chicken farms could be the hotspot for the co-spread of microplastics and ARGs. Conjugative transfer experiments were performed to investigate the effects of microplastic exposure for different concentrations and sizes on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs between bacteria. Results showed that the microplastics significantly enhanced the bacterial conjugative transfer frequency by 1.4–1.7 folds indicating that microplastics could aggravate ARG dissemination in the environment. Potential mechanisms related to the up-regulation of rpoS, ompA, ompC, ompF, trbBp, traF, trfAp, traJ, and down-regulation of korA, korB, and trbA were induced by microplastics. These findings highlighted the co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in the agricultural environment and the exacerbation of ARGs' prevalence via rising the HGT derived from microplastics.","Yu X., Zhou Z.-C., Shuai X.-Y., Lin Z.-J., Liu Z., Zhou J.-Y., Lin Y.-H., Zeng G.-S., Ge Z.-Y., Chen H.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131130,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Parity In Bacterial Communities And Resistomes: Microplastic And Natural Organic Particles In The Tyrrhenian Sea,"Petroleum-based microplastic particles (MPs) are carriers of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, influencing the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. This research characterized MP and natural organic particle (NOP) bacterial communities and resistomes in the Tyrrhenian Sea, a region impacted by plastic pollution and climate change. MP and NOP bacterial communities were similar but different from the free-living planktonic communities. Likewise, MP and NOP ARG abundances were similar but different (higher) from the planktonic communities. MP and NOP metagenome-assembled genomes contained ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements and exhibited co-occurrence with metal resistance genes. Overall, these findings show that MPs and NOPs harbor potential pathogenic and antimicrobial resistant bacteria, which can aid in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Further, petroleum-based MPs do not represent novel ecological niches for allochthonous bacteria; rather, they synergize with NOPs, collectively facilitating the spread of antimicrobial resistance in marine ecosystems.","Di Cesare A., Sathicq M.B., Sbaffi T., Sabatino R., Manca D., Breider F., Coudret S., Pinnell L.J., Turner J.W., Corno G.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116495,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Conjugative Antibiotic-Resistant Plasmids Promote Bacterial Colonization Of Microplastics In Water Environments,"Both microplastic and bacterial antibiotic resistance have attracted attention worldwide. When microplastics coexist with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), which carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), ARB colonize the surface of microplastics, and a unique biofilm is formed. The ARB and ARGs in biofilms are denser and more difficult to remove. However, studies on the factors influencing the formation of microplastic biofilms are limited. In this study, plasmid RP4, which appeared in wastewater treatment plants, was found to be able to promote irreversible bacterial colonization of microplastics, and the hypothetical reason was conjugative pili expression. Then, the potential conjugative pili synthesis promoter “nanoalumina” and inhibitor “free nitrous acid” (FNA) were selected to test this hypothesis. Simultaneously, nanoalumina promoted and FNA inhibited bacterial colonization when RP4 existed. Combined with the gene expression and ATP analysis results, this hypothesis was confirmed, and the mechanism of RP4 on bacterial colonization was related mainly to conjugative pili protein synthesis and intracellular ATP. In this study, the effects of plasmid RP4, nanoalumina, and FNA on the formation of microplastic biofilms were reported, which has a certain reference value for other researchers exploring microplastic biofilms.","Zhang G., Chen J., Li W.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128443,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Is The Application Of Organic Fertilizers Becoming An Undeniable Source Of Microplastics And Resistance Genes In Agricultural Systems?,"The application of organic fertilizers is becoming an undeniable source of microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soils. The complex microbial activity further transfers resistance genes and their host bacteria to agricultural products and throughout the entire food chain. Therefore, the current main focus is on reducing the abundance of microplastics and ARGs in organic fertilizers at the source, as well as managing microplastics and ARGs in soil. The control of microplastic abundance in organic fertilizers is currently only achieved through pre-composting selection and other methods. However, there are still many shortcomings in the research on the distribution characteristics, propagation and diffusion mechanisms, and control technologies of ARGs, and some key scientific issues still need to be urgently addressed. The high-temperature composting of organic waste can effectively reduce the abundance of ARGs in organic fertilizers to a certain extent. However, it is also important to consider the spread of ARGs in residual antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). This article systematically explores the pathways and interactions of microplastics and resistance genes entering agricultural soils through the application of organic fertilizers. The removal of microplastics and ARGs from organic fertilizers was discussed in detail. Based on the limitations of existing research, further investigation in this area is expected to provide valuable insights for the development and practical implementation of technologies aimed at reducing soil microplastics and resistance genes.","Li T., Tao S., Ma M., Liu S., Shen M., Zhang H.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169571,Science Of The Total Environment
Tire Particles And Its Leachates: Impact On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Coastal Sediments,"Tire particles (TPs), a significant group of microplastics, can be discharged into the coastal environments in various ways. However, our understanding of how TPs impact the antibiotic resistance and pathogenic risks of microorganisms in coastal sediments remains limited. In this study, we used metagenomics to investigate how TPs and their leachates could affect the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and their potential risks to the living creatures such as soil invertebrates and microorganisms in the coastal sediments. We discovered that TP addition significantly increased the abundance and diversity of ARGs and VFGs in coastal sediments, with raw TPs displayed higher impacts than TP leachates and TPs after leaching on ARGs and VFGs. With increasing TP exposure concentrations, the co-occurrence frequency of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the same contig also increased, suggesting that TPs could enhance the dispersal risk of ARGs. Our metagenome-based binning analysis further revealed that exposure to TPs increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB). In addition, chemical additives of TP leachates (e.g., Zn and N-cyclohexylformamide) significantly affected the changes of ARGs in the pore water. In summary, our study provides novel insights into the adverse effects of TP pollutions on aggravating the dissemination and pathogenic risks of ARGs and PARB in the coastal environment.","Xu J.-Y., Ding J., Du S., Zhu D.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133333,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Different Microplastics Distinctively Enriched The Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Sludge Digestion Through Shifting Specific Hosts And Promoting Horizontal Gene Flow,"Both microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are intensively detected in waste activated sludge (WAS). However, the distinctive impacts of different MPs on ARGs emergence, dissemination, and its potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, long-term semi-continuous digesters were performed to examine the profiles of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in response to two different typical MPs (polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) in anaerobic sludge digestion. Metagenomic results show that PE- and PVC-MPs increase ARGs abundance by 14.8% and 23.6% in digester, respectively. ARB are also enriched by PE- and PVC-MPs, Acinetobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. are the dominant ARB. Further exploration reveals that PVC-MPs stimulates the acquisition of ARGs by human pathogen bacteria (HPB) and functional microorganisms (FMs), but PE-MPs doesn't. Network analysis shows that more ARGs tend to co-occur with HBP and FMs after MPs exposure, and more importantly, new bacteria are observed to acquire ARGs possibly via horizontal gene flow (HGF) in MPs-stressed digester. The genes involved in the HGF process, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell membrane permeability, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, and ATP synthesis, are also enhanced by MPs, thereby attributing to the promoted ARGs dissemination. These findings offer advanced insights into the distinctive contribution of MPs to fate, host, dissemination of ARGs in anaerobic sludge digestion.","Luo T., Dai X., Chen Z., Wu L., Wei W., Xu Q., Ni B.-J.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119356,Water Research
Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria On Daphnia Magna Growth And Expression Of Functional Genes,"Microplastics could act as vectors for the transport of harmful bacteria, such as pathogens and antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB), but their combined effects have not been reported yet. Here, ARB Shigella flexneri with sulfonamides resistance and micro-polystyrene (micro-PS) were used to investigate their possible combined effects on the growth and expression of functional genes in Daphnia magna. Results showed that micro-PS colonized with S. flexneri were ingested by D. magna and blocked in their intestine after 24 h exposure. Changes were observed in the life history and morphology of D. magna, as well as the expression of functional genes in all treatments, but with no difference in the survival rate. We also determined the expression of six functional genes involved in energy and metabolism (arginine kinase, AK) and oxidative stress response (thioredoxin reductase, TRxR, catalase, CAT, and glutathione S-transferases, GSTs), as well as in growth, development and reproduction (vitellogenin, Vtg1 and ecdysone receptor, EcR). AK and Vtg1 did not show significant differences, however, EcR was down-regulated and the other three genes (TRxR, CAT, GSTs) were up-regulated in the combined-treated group. Antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) sul1 was detected when exposed to micro-PS colonized with S. flexneri., suggesting that D. magna could acquire resistance genes through microplastic biofilms. These results indicated that MPs could act as a carrier of ARB to transfer ARGs into D. magna, and affect the life history, morphology, and the expression of related functional genes of D. magna, to adapt to the stress caused by MPs and ARB.","Chen X., Wang X., Huang Y., Zhu Z., Li T., Cai Z., Li M., Gong H., Yan M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166880,Science Of The Total Environment
Potential Environmental Risks Of Field Bio/Non-Degradable Microplastic From Mulching Residues In Farmland: Evidence From Metagenomic Analysis Of Plastisphere,"The plastisphere may act as reservoir of antibiotic resistome, accelerating global antimicrobial resistance dissemination. However, the environmental risks in the plastisphere of field microplastics (MPs) in farmland remain largely unknown. Here, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) on polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate and polylactic acid microplastics (PBAT/PLA-MPs) from residues were investigated using metagenomic analysis. The results suggested that the profiles of ARG and VF in the plastisphere of PBAT/PLA-MPs had greater number of detected genes with statistically higher values of diversity and abundance than soil and PE-MP. Procrustes analysis indicated a good fitting correlation between ARG/VF profiles and bacterial community composition. Actinobacteria was the major host for tetracycline and glycopeptide resistance genes in the soil and PE-MP plastisphere, whereas the primary host for multidrug resistance genes changed to Proteobacteria in PBAT/PLA-MP plastisphere. Besides, three human pathogens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in the plastisphere. The PE-MP plastisphere exhibited a higher transfer potential of ARGs than PBAT/PLA-MP plastisphere. This work enhances our knowledge of potential environmental risks posed by microplastic in farmland and provides valuable insights for risk assessment and management of agricultural mulching applications.","Li K., Xu L., Bai X., Zhang G., Zhang M., Huang Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133428,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Dissemination Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Associated With Microplastics Collected From Monastir And Mahdia Coasts (Tunisia),"The exponential use of plastics and their recalcitrant nature leads to their significant accumulation in the environment. The occurrence of plastic wastes is considered as a serious environmental problem. Additionally, plastic wastes can break down into smaller pieces called microplastics (MPs), leading to further interactions with the environment and living organisms. In this study, sixty-six strains were isolated from microplastic particles collected on different coastal areas of Monastir and Mahdia (Tunisia). The different bacterial isolates were identified according to some biochemical tests such as catalase, oxidase, and were subjected to molecular characterization. Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) revealed the presence of 31 ITS haplotypes. The partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA of representative strains was analyzed. The majority of bacterial isolates (84.31 %) belonged to Gamma-proteobacteria (84.78 %), while the remaining isolates were affiliated to Firmicutes (15.21 %). The microplastic-associated bacterial isolates belonged to 10 genera, namely Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Shewanella, Aeromonas, Vibrio, Stutzerimonas, Exiguobacterium, Enterobacter. Among the well-represented Acinetobacter genus, the most common species identified was Acinetobacter johnsonii. Susceptibility patterns of these strains were studied against 21 antibiotics commonly used in Tunisia. A high level of antibiotic resistance was observed for Penicillin G (97.82 %) and Temocillin (86.95 %). S26 strain presented the highest multidrug resistance with a multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.71.","Hassen W., Danioux A., Oueslati A., Santana-Rodríguez J.J., Sire O., Sedrati M., Ben Mansour H.",10.1016/j.micpath.2024.107193,Microbial Pathogenesis
Plastic Debris In The Aquatic Environment: An Emerging Substratum For Antimicrobial Resistant (Amr) Biofilms,"Plastic pollution has quadrupled over the past years and has become a global concern due to its direct impact on life forms. The present study analysed whether the plastic debris in aquatic environments could act as the substratum for the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria to form biofilm for survival. We have collected various plastic debris (n = 32) from six sites of the Periyar River, the drinking water source for the entire city and one of the most polluted rivers in Kerala (India). The chemical composition of plastics was screened via FTIR analysis and found that they comprised two types, viz., polyethylene and polypropylene. Bacteria isolated from the samples were screened for the AMR characteristics towards eight different classes of antibiotics. All isolates showed 100% resistance towards colistin and obtained the MAR index value of 0.1–0.4 range. Six representative bacterial isolates with high multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index were selected and identified by 16sRNA sequencing as Lysinibacillus mangiferihumi, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus altitudins and Bacillus pumilus. In vitro biofilm formation was experimented on the purchased plastic samples in artificial media and river water using two selected strains, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus cereus. Significant variations were observed in biofilm growth in different media (P < 0.05) regardless of plastic types (P > 0.05). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the characteristic holes on the surface morphology were visualized in SEM analysis, thus indicating the conditioning of the plastics by the isolates for biofilm formation.","Suresh S., Ambily S.K.A., Chandran P.",10.1007/s00244-024-01086-6,Archives Of Environmental Contamination And Toxicology
Does Antifouling Paint Select For Antibiotic Resistance?,"There is concern that heavy metals and biocides contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5–4 weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.","Flach C.-F., Pal C., Svensson C.J., Kristiansson E., Östman M., Bengtsson-Palme J., Tysklind M., Larsson D.G.J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.213,Science Of The Total Environment
The Formation Of Specific Bacterial Communities Contributes To The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Soil Plastisphere,"Soil serves as a major reservoir of both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics. However, the characteristics of the antibiotic resistome in the soil plastisphere remain largely unknown. In this study, we used metagenomic approaches to reveal the changing patterns of ARGs and the bacterial community and their associations in response to three types of microplastics (light density polyethylene, LDPE; polypropylene, PP; polystyrene, PS) using particles 550 µm or 75 µm in diameter. The total ARG abundances significantly increased in the plastisphere and varied across plastic types. The LDPE plastisphere had the highest ARG total abundance and lowest Shannon diversity index, indicating that this plastic had the most severe negative impact on soil bacterial diversity. The PP plastisphere contained higher relative abundances of the pathogenic bacteria Acinetobacter johnsonii and Escherichia coli, demonstrating the higher pathogenic risk of the microbial communities enriched in the plastisphere. Specifically, multidrug resistance genes (ceoB and MuxB) co-existed with more than four microbial taxa, increasing the potential risk of ARG spread in pathogenic bacteria. These findings implied that the plastisphere acts as a hotspot for acquiring and spreading antibiotic resistance and may have long-term negative effects on the soil ecosystem and human health.","Yang Y., Li T., Liu P., Li H., Hu F.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129247,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Detection Of Morganella Morganii Bound To A Plastic Substrate In Surface Water,"Objectives: Around the globe, escalation in rare opportunistic microbial infections is alarming as they are heading steadily towards 'superbug' status. In aquatic ecosystems, plastic fosters multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria and plays a significant role in trafficking antibiotic-resistant genes. In this study, we focused on a multidrug-resistant bacterial strain isolated from microbial communities found on plastic substrates of a volcanic lake in central Italy. Methods: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains were isolated from both raw water and plastic substrates for a comparative investigation using microbiological and molecular methods, and antibiotic susceptibility profiling was performed against a panel of ten antibiotics. Results: Molecular identification and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis confirmed an almost identical sequencing pattern of two isolated strains and their homology with Morganella morganii. Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed their resistance to almost all tested antibiotics. Class 1 integron-associated gene (intI1) and seven antibiotic resistance genes were detected in both strains, confirming their superbug status. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study on the characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing M. morganii isolated from the biofilm of plastic substrates, depicting the potential toxicity of plastic in harbouring and dispersing virulent, multidrug-resistant, opportunistic human pathogens.","Ferheen I., Spurio R., Mancini L., Marcheggiani S.",10.1016/j.jgar.2023.01.008,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance

Water Quality And Antibiotic Resistance In The Recreational Waters,"The overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance. This raises concern over the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in waterways and pose health risks of antibiotic resistant infections to water recreationists. The purpose of this study was to monitor water quality, microbial ecology, and antibiotic resistance in water and biofilm on submerged plastics at two public boat launches in southeastern Louisiana. Water and biofilm samples were collected once a month, in triplicate, from two public boat launches in Louisiana, USA for a year. Water quality metrics included nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, phosphate, and organic carbon. Water samples were tested for total and fecal coliform abundance and the presence of ARB. Out of 131 bacterial isolates studied from these two sites, 86% of them tested positive for antibiotic resistance with multi-drug resistance. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for sulfonamide (sul2), bacitracin (bacA) and ampicillin (ampA) were identified in bacterial isolates from water and biofilm samples at both sites. Molecular genetic diversity analysis identified distinct taxonomic diversity differences in biofilm bacteria compared to the planktonic bacteria in the surrounding water.

Integrated Metagenomic And Metatranscriptomic Analysis Reveals Actively Expressed Antibiotic Resistomes In The Plastisphere,"The plastisphere is viewed as a reservoir for the antibiotic resistome in water environments and may pose health concerns. However, the expression profiles of the resistome in the plastisphere are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the occurrence, abundance, and transcriptional level of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), plasmid associated ARGs, microbial composition and ARG bacterial hosts in the plastisphere and urban river water using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and metatranscriptomic sequencing methods. A total of 173 ARGs conferring resistance to 24 major classes of antibiotics commonly prescribed to humans and animals were detected in the plastisphere. Of these, 75 genes were observed with transcriptional activity, indicating that the antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere was not only present, but also actively expressed. Human pathogens belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae were identified as bacterial hosts of ARGs in the plastisphere. The opportunistic and multidrug resistant human pathogen Enterobacter cloacae was found to actively express tetG and confer tetracycline resistance to the plastisphere. Furthermore, 39 genes were identified as “plasmid associated ARGs” in the plastisphere, displaying a higher proportion of transcript abundance compared with water. The above results suggest that the plastisphere is a hotspot for antibiotic resistome acquisition, expression, and dissemination.","Wu X., Liu Z., Li M., Bartlam M., Wang Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128418,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Alteration Of The Migration Trajectory Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes By Microplastics In A Leachate Activated Sludge System,"The environmental behavior of emerging contaminants of microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the leachate activated sludge system has been monitored and analyzed comprehensively. The results suggested that MPs could effectively alter the migration trajectory of tetracycline resistance genes (tet genes) in the leachate activated sludge system under intermittent and continuous influent conditions. After adding MPs, the total average abundance of tet genes in leachate increased from 0.74 ± 0.07 to 0.78 ± 0.07 (log(10) tet genes/log(10) 16S rRNA) and that in sludge increased from 0.65 ± 0.08 to 0.70 ± 0.06 (log(10) tet genes/log(10) 16S rRNA). Except for tetA, the abundance of tetB, tetO, tetM and tetQ on MPs increased with increasing TC concentration under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. MPs not only significantly affect the abundance level and migration trajectory of ARGs in the leachate activated sludge system, but also remarkably improve the level of heavy metals in the ambient environment, indirectly promoting the selective effect of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and promoting the development of antibiotic resistance (AR). In addition, MPs changed their physicochemical properties and released hazardous substances with aging to force tet genes to migrate from the leachate activated sludge system to the MPs, making AR more difficult to eliminate and persisted in wastewater treatment plants. Meanwhile, microorganisms played a driving role, making MPs serve as a niche for ARGs and ARB colonization. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated the specific distribution pattern of tet genes and microorganisms in different media, and the potential host was speculated. This study improves the understanding of the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants in leachate activated sludge system and lays a theoretical for protecting the ecological environment.","Liu H., Li H., Qiu L., Xie Q., Lu Y., Chen B., Wang H., Long Y., Hu L., Fang C.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121981,Environmental Pollution
Determining The Contribution Of Micro/Nanoplastics To Antimicrobial Resistance: Challenges And Perspectives,"Microorganisms colonizing the surfaces of microplastics form a plastisphere in the environment, which captures miscellaneous substances. The plastisphere, owning to its inherently complex nature, may serve as a “Petri dish” for the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), adding a layer of complexity in tackling the global challenge of both microplastics and ARGs. Increasing studies have drawn insights into the extent to which the proliferation of ARGs occurred in the presence of micro/nanoplastics, thereby increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, a comprehensive review is still lacking in consideration of the current increasingly scattered research focus and results. This review focuses on the spread of ARGs mediated by microplastics, especially on the challenges and perspectives on determining the contribution of microplastics to AMR. The plastisphere accumulates biotic and abiotic materials on the persistent surfaces, which, in turn, offers a preferred environment for gene exchange within and across the boundary of the plastisphere. Microplastics breaking down to smaller sizes, such as nanoscale, can possibly promote the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs as environmental stressors by inducing the overgeneration of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, we also discussed methods, especially quantitatively comparing ARG profiles among different environmental samples in this emerging field and the challenges that multidimensional parameters are in great necessity to systematically determine the antimicrobial dissemination risk in the plastisphere. Finally, based on the biological sequencing data, we offered a framework to assess the AMR risks of micro/nanoplastics and biocolonizable microparticles that leverage multidimensional AMR-associated messages, including the ARGs’ abundance, mobility, and potential acquisition by pathogens.","Luo G., Liang B., Cui H., Kang Y., Zhou X., Tao Y., Lu L., Fan L., Guo J., Wang A., Gao S.-H.",10.1021/acs.est.3c01128,Environmental Science And Technology
Distinguishing Removal And Regrowth Potential Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria On Microplastics And In Leachate After Chlorination Or Fenton Oxidation,"The prevalence of antibiotic resistance, as well as microplastics (MPs) as vectors for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has attracting growing attention. However, the fate of ARB/ARGs on MPs treated by chlorination and Fenton oxidation were poorly understood. Herein, the removal and regrowth of ARGs/ARB on MPs and in MPs-surrounding landfill leachate (an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs) after chlorination and Fenton oxidation were comparatively analyzed. Target ARGs on MPs were reduced obviously less than that in leachate, with the largest percentages reduction of 34.0–46.3% vs. 54.3–77.6% after chlorination and 92.1–97.3% vs. > 99.9% after Fenton oxidation, and similar removal patterns were observed for ARB. Moreover, a considerable regrowth of ARGs/ARB in leachate were found after 48 h of storage at the end of chlorination (5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/L), and a greater regrowth of ARGs and ARB occurred on MPs with up to 17 and 139 fold, respectively. In contrast, Fenton oxidation achieved a reduced regrowth of target ARGs/ARB. These findings indicated that the removal of ARGs/ARB on MPs were more difficult than that in leachate, and ARGs/ARB in leachate and especially on MPs exhibited a considerable potential for rapid regrowth after chlorination.","Shi J., Wang B., Li X., Su Y., Wu D., Xie B.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128432,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Fate Of Environmental Pollutants,"This annual review covers the literature published in 2017 on topics related to the occurrence and fate of emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater. Due to the vast amount of literature published on this topic, we have discussed only a portion of the quality research publications, due to the limitation of space. The abstract search was carried out using Web of Science, and the abstracts were selected based on their relevance. In few cases, full-text articles were referred to better understand new findings. This review is divided into the following sections: antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), disinfection by-products (DBPs), estrogens, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and microplastics, a new section added this year.","Zad T.J., Astuti M.P., Padhye L.P.",10.2175/106143018X15289915807191,Water Environment Research
Microplastic-Associated Pathogens And Antimicrobial Resistance In Environment,"The ubiquitous use of microplastics and their release into the environment especially the water bodies by anthropogenic/industrial activities are the major resources for microplastic contamination. The widespread and often injudicious use of antimicrobial drugs or antibiotics in various sectors including human health and hygiene, agriculture, animal husbandry and food industries are leading to the release of antibiotics into the wastewater/sewage and other water bodies, particularly in urban setups and thus leads to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the microbes. Microplastics are emerging as the hubs as well as effective carriers of these microbial pathogens beside their AMR-genes (ARGs) in marine, freshwater, sewage/wastewater, and urban river ecosystems. These drug resistant bacteria interact with microplastics forming synthetic plastispheres, the ideal niche for biofilm formations which in turn facilitates the transfer of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer and further escalates the occurrence and levels of AMR. Microplastic-associated AMR is an emerging threat for human health and healthcare besides being a challenge for the research community for effective management/address of this menace. In this review, we encompass the increasing prevalence of microplastics in environment, emphasizing mainly on water environments, how they act as centers and vectors of microbial pathogens with their associated bacterial assemblage compositions and ultimately lead to AMR. It further discusses the mechanistic insights on how microplastics act as hosts of biofilms (creating the plastisphere). We have also presented the modern toolbox used for microplastic-biofilm analyses. A review on potential strategies for addressing microplastic-associated AMR is given with recent success stories, challenges and future prospects.","Kaur K., Reddy S., Barathe P., Oak U., Shriram V., Kharat S.S., Govarthanan M., Kumar V.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.133005,Chemosphere
Retrospective Study Of The Efficacy Of Vascularized Tissue Transfer For Treating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria-Infected Wound: Comparison With Clean And Antibiotic-Sensitive Bacteria-Infected Wound,"If wounds are infected with bacteria resistant to an empirical antibiotic regimen, effective wound treatment will be delayed. This can delay wound healing and lengthen hospital stays, increasing the costs to patients. Long-term antibiotic use can also result in minor and major complications, such as diarrhea, antibiotic resistance, or life-threatening leukopenia. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria make wound treatment even more difficult. Traditionally, surgeons thought that adequate infection control should be established before soft tissue coverage. However, wounds infected by MDR do not heal well with this traditional method and there are no optimal treatment guidelines for MDR bacteria-contaminated wounds.We reviewed 203 patients who underwent vascularized flap surgery from 2012 to 2019 to cover wounds. Class IV and I wounds were compared according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification. Class IV was further classified as antibiotic-resistant (ARB) and antibiotic-sensitive (ASB) bacteria. Wound size, mode, location, pathogens, healing time, and basic demographics were evaluated. Data were compared using Cramer's V and one-way ANOVA or independent t tests.The average healing time was longer in the ARB (19.7 [range 7-44] days) and ASB (17.9 [range 2-36] days) groups than in the Clean group (16.5 [range 7-28] days). Healing time differed in the 3 groups (P =.036). It was longer in the class IV group than in the class I group (P =.01). However, it was not statistically different between the ARB and ASB groups (P = .164).In our study the difference in healing time was small when vascularized tissue transfer was done in ARB-infected wound compared with ASB-infected and clean wound. It is necessary to perform surgery using vascularized tissue for the infected wound of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Kim S.H., Lee J.H., Kim S.E., Shin S.H., Kim H.J., Lee S.J., Kim J.H., Suh I.S.",10.1097/MD.0000000000025907,Medicine (United States)
Deciphering The Mechanisms Shaping The Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistome On Riverine Microplastics,"Microplastics in urban rivers provide bacterial niches and serve as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) dissemination, which may exacerbate risks in the aquatic systems. However, whether MPs in the river would also selectively enrich ARGs and the underlying mechanisms shaping the resistome on MPs remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the occurrence of ARGs, bacterial communities, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) on MPs and in waters from the Huangpu River in China. Microplastics were widely distributed in the river (1.78 ± 0.84 items/L), with overwhelming percentages of polyethylene terephthalate fibers. Although reduced ARG abundances were observed on MPs than in waters, MPs selectively enriched the ARGs resistant to Rifamycin and Vancomycin. A clear variation for ARG profiles was elucidated between water and MPs samples. Network analysis suggested that MPs created a unique niche for the genus Afipia to colonize, potentially contributing to the vertical dissemination of ARGs. Additionally, the co-occurrence between ARGs and MGEs revealed that the MPs favor the propagation of some plasmid-associated ARGs mediated by horizontal gene transfer. The null model-based stochasticity ratio and the neutral community model suggested that the ARG assembly on MPs was dominantly driven by stochastic process. The results further indicated that microbial communities and MGEs played significant roles in shaping ARG profiles and dynamics on MPs. Our findings provided new insights into the ecological processes of antibiotic resistome of the aquatic plastisphere.","Xu C., Lu J., Shen C., Wang J., Li F.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119192,Water Research
The Antibiotic Crisis: On The Search For Novel Antibiotics And Resistance Mechanisms,"In the relentless battle for human health, the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has emerged as an impending catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude, potentially driving humanity towards the brink of an unparalleled healthcare crisis. The unyielding advance of antibiotic resistance looms as the foremost threat of the 21st century in clinical, agricultural and environmental arenas. Antibiotic resistance is projected to be the genesis of the next global pandemic, with grim estimations of tens of millions of lives lost annually by 2050. Amidst this impending calamity, our capacity to unearth novel antibiotics has languished, with the past four decades marred by a disheartening ‘antibiotic discovery void’. With nearly 80% of our current antibiotics originating from natural or semi-synthetic sources, our responsibility is to cast our investigative nets into uncharted ecological niches teeming with microbial strife, the so-called ‘microbial oases of interactions’. Within these oases of interactions, where microorganisms intensively compete for space and nutrients, a dynamic and ever-evolving microbial ‘arms race’ is constantly in place. Such a continuous cycle of adaptation and counter-adaptation is a fundamental aspect of microbial ecology and evolution, as well as the secrets to unique, undiscovered antibiotics, our last bastion against the relentless tide of resistance. In this context, it is imperative to invest in research to explore the competitive realms, like the plant rhizosphere, biological soil crusts, deep sea hydrothermal vents, marine snow and the most modern plastisphere, in which competitive interactions are at the base of the microorganisms' struggle for survival and dominance in their ecosystems: identify novel antibiotic by targeting microbial oases of interactions could represent a ‘missing piece of the puzzle’ in our fight against antibiotic resistance.","Van Goethem M.W., Marasco R., Hong P.-Y., Daffonchio D.",10.1111/1751-7915.14430,Microbial Biotechnology
"Persistent Versus Transient, And Conventional Plastic Versus Biodegradable Plastic? —Two Key Questions About Microplastic-Water Exchange Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes","The ubiquitous microplastics (MPs) in water environment play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) due to their exchange between floating MPs and receiving waters. However, whether the ARG exchange is persistent or transient and what are the differences in ARG exchange between conventional plastics and biodegradable plastics are the two key issues to be addressed. In this study, biodegradable PBAT and non-biodegradable PET MPs were chosen to explore the MP-water ARG exchange after the MPs floated to the receiving waters. The results demonstrated that the active exchange of ARGs between MPs and receiving waters occurred, which, however, were transient for most of ARGs. The relative abundance of ARGs both on the MPs and in the waters rapidly decreased to the initial or lower levels within 4 weeks. Approximately 25–50% (ARG subtype number ratio) of studied ARG subtypes were introduced into the receiving waters by MPs, and 35–65% of studied ARG subtypes went through fluctuation in terms of abundance on MPs and in the receiving water. ARGs tended to converge between MPs and the receiving waters with time. Furthermore, the ARG exchange between MPs and waters facilitated horizontal gene transfer (HGT). IntI1 and tnpA05 played the crucial roles in HGT, which was indicated by their correlated change with most ARGs; in contrast, tnpA04 showed the obvious lagging responses. The biodegradable MP of PBAT generally accumulated higher levels of most ARGs including multidrug resistant genes than the non-biodegradable MP of PET. The transient exchange of most ARGs between MPs and water implies that the on-off hitchhiking of ARGs on MPs in aquatic environment may not exert significant influence on ARG transmission. However, compared with the conventional plastics, the biodegradable MPs might pose much higher ARG dissemination risks due to the higher enrichment of ARGs particularly with people's ever-increasingly usage. Enough attention must be paid to this emerging issue.","Zhou Q., Zhang J., Zhang M., Wang X., Zhang D., Pan X.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118899,Water Research
Microbial Hitchhikers Harbouring Antimicrobial-Resistance Genes In The Riverine Plastisphere,"Background: The widespread nature of plastic pollution has given rise to wide scientific and social concern regarding the capacity of these materials to serve as vectors for pathogenic bacteria and reservoirs for Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARG). In- and ex-situ incubations were used to characterise the riverine plastisphere taxonomically and functionally in order to determine whether antibiotics within the water influenced the ARG profiles in these microbiomes and how these compared to those on natural surfaces such as wood and their planktonic counterparts. Results: We show that plastics support a taxonomically distinct microbiome containing potential pathogens and ARGs. While the plastisphere was similar to those biofilms that grew on wood, they were distinct from the surrounding water microbiome. Hence, whilst potential opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Aeromonas) and ARG subtypes (i.e. those that confer resistance to macrolides/lincosamides, rifamycin, sulfonamides, disinfecting agents and glycopeptides) were predominant in all surface-related microbiomes, especially on weathered plastics, a completely different set of potential pathogens (i.e. Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella and Streptococcus) and ARGs (i.e. aminoglycosides, tetracycline, aminocoumarin, fluoroquinolones, nitroimidazole, oxazolidinone and fosfomycin) dominated in the planktonic compartment. Our genome-centric analysis allowed the assembly of 215 Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), linking ARGs and other virulence-related genes to their host. Interestingly, a MAG belonging to Escherichia –that clearly predominated in water– harboured more ARGs and virulence factors than any other MAG, emphasising the potential virulent nature of these pathogenic-related groups. Finally, ex-situ incubations using environmentally-relevant concentrations of antibiotics increased the prevalence of their corresponding ARGs, but different riverine compartments –including plastispheres– were affected differently by each antibiotic. Conclusions: Our results provide insights into the capacity of the riverine plastisphere to harbour a distinct set of potentially pathogenic bacteria and function as a reservoir of ARGs. The environmental impact that plastics pose if they act as a reservoir for either pathogenic bacteria or ARGs is aggravated by the persistence of plastics in the environment due to their recalcitrance and buoyancy. Nevertheless, the high similarities with microbiomes growing on natural co-occurring materials and even more worrisome microbiome observed in the surrounding water highlights the urgent need to integrate the analysis of all environmental compartments when assessing risks and exposure to pathogens and ARGs in anthropogenically-impacted ecosystems.

Performance Of Sewage Sludge Treatment For The Removal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Status And Prospects,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) receive wastewater containing antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), which are predominant contributors to environmental pollution in water and soil. Of these sources, sludge is a more significant contributor than effluent. Knowing how sludge treatment affects the fate of ARGs is vital for managing the risk of these genes in both human and natural environments. This review therefore discusses the sources and transmission of ARGs in the environment and highlights the risks of ARGs in sludge. The effects of co-existing constituents (heavy metals, microplastics, etc.) on sludge and ARGs during treatment are collated to highlight the difficulty of treating sludge with complex constituents in ARGs. The effects of various sludge treatment methods on the abundances of ARGs in sludge and in soil from land application of treated sludge are discussed, pointing out that the choice of sludge treatment method should take into account various potential factors, such as soil and soil biology in subsequent land application. This review offers significant insights and explores the abundances of ARGs throughout the process of sludge treatment and disposal. Unintentional addition of antibiotic residues, heavy metals, microplastics and organic matter in sludge could significantly increase the abundance and reduce the removal efficiency of ARGs during treatment, which undoubtedly adds a barrier to the removal of ARGs from sludge treatment. The complexity of the sludge composition and the diversities of ARGs have led to the fact that no effective sludge treatment method has so far been able to completely eliminate the ecological risk of ARGs. In order to reduce risks resulting by transmission of ARGs, technical and management measures need to be implemented.","Yin S., Gao L., Fan X., Gao S., Zhou X., Jin W., He Z., Wang Q.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167862,Science Of The Total Environment
Plastisphere In A Low-Pollution Mountain River: Influence Of Microplastics On Survival Of Pathogenic Bacteria,"Microplastics (MPs) are found even in remote and low-pollution freshwater ecosystems. However, the microbial communities associated with MPs in these environments remain poorly understood. We characterized the plastisphere in a low-pollution riverine ecosystem and evaluated the influence of different MPs in the persistence of pathogens in such environments. A mixture of MPs (MPs Mix) composed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was submerged at three locations (L1, L2 and L3) in the river. For comparison purposes, water and sand communities were also analyzed. Our results revealed distinct bacterial communities on MPs compared to those in water or on the natural substrate (sand). However, the resemblance between the plastisphere and communities on natural particles was higher than what has been reported for polluted ecosystems. Although pathogens were predominantly enriched in the water, a few genera (e.g. Acinetobacter, Legionella and Mycobacterium) were enriched in the plastisphere. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes did not differ significantly between water, sand, and MPs. The influence of different MPs (PE, PP, PET) on the persistence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (i.e. cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli and meropenem-resistant Enterobacter kobei) in unpolluted water was assessed in microcosms. Significant differences were observed between the microcosms with MPs and those with natural particles (sand), after a 36-day exposure. A significantly higher persistence of the pathogens was registered in microcosms with PE and PET. Our results provide new insights into the plastisphere in non-pollution environments and demonstrate that even in these settings, MPs can facilitate the survival and dissemination of pathogens.","Silva I., Rodrigues E.T., Tacão M., Henriques I.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143800,Chemosphere
Distinct Species Turnover Patterns Shaped The Richness Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Eight Different Microplastic Polymers,"Elucidating the formation mechanism of plastisphere antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on different polymers is necessary to understand the ecological risks of plastisphere ARGs. Here, we explored the turnover and assembly mechanism of plastisphere ARGs on 8 different microplastic polymers (4 biodegradable (bMPs) and 4 non-biodegradable microplastics (nMPs)) by metagenomic sequencing. Our study revealed the presence of 479 ARGs with abundance ranging from 41.37 to 58.17 copies/16S rRNA gene in all plastispheres. These ARGs were predominantly multidrug resistance genes. The richness of plastisphere ARGs on different polymers had a significant correlation with the contribution of species turnover to plastisphere ARGs β diversity. Furthermore, polymer type was the most critical factor affecting the composition of plastisphere ARGs. More opportunistic pathogens carrying diverse ARGs on BMPs (PBAT, PBS, and PHA) with higher horizontal gene transfer potential may further magnify the ecological risks and human health threats. For example, the opportunistic pathogens Riemerella anatipestifer, Vibrio campbellii, and Vibrio cholerae are closely related to human production and life, which were the important potential hosts of many plastisphere ARGs and mobile genetic elements on BMPs. Thus, we emphasize the urgency of developing the formation mechanism of plastisphere ARGs and the necessity of controlling BMPs and ARG pollution, especially BMPs, with ever-increasing usage in daily life.","Zhang W., Geng J., Sun M., Jiang C., Lin H., Chen H., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119562,Environmental Research
Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistant Genes And Pathogens In Face Masks From Coastal Environments,"Face masks (FMs) are essential to limit the spread of the coronavirus during pandemic, a considerable of which are accumulated on the coast. However, limited is known about the microbial profile in the biofilm of the face masks (so-called plastisphere) and the impacts of face masks on the surrounding environments. We herein performed face mask exposures to coastal sediments and characterized the microbial community and the antibiotic resistome. We detected 64 antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) and 12 mobile gene elements (MGEs) in the plastisphere. Significant enrichments were found in the relative abundance of total ARGs in the plastisphere compared to the sediments. In detail, the relative abundance of tetracycline, multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), and phenicol-resistant genes had increased by 5–10 times. Moreover, the relative abundance of specific hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (e.g., Polycyclovorans sp.), pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas oleovorans), and total MGEs significantly increased in the sediments after face mask exposure, which was congruent with the alteration of pH value and metal concentrations in the microcosms. Our study demonstrated the negative impacts of FMs on coastal environments regardless of the profiles of ARGs or pathogens. These findings improved the understanding of the ecological risks of face masks and underlined the importance of beach cleaning.","Cheng J., Xing D., Wang P., Tang S., Cai Z., Zhou J., Zhu X.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131038,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastics In The Marine Environment Are Reservoirs For Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes,"Plastics have been accumulated offshore and in the deep oceans at an unprecedented scale. Microbial communities have colonized the plastisphere, which has become a reservoir for both antibiotic and metal resistance genes (ARGs and MRGs). This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence of ARGs and MRGs, and their relationships within the microbial community, using metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database. The abundance of ARGs and MRGs in microbial communities on the plastics were in the ranges 7.07 × 10(−4)–1.21 × 10(−2) and 5.51 × 10(−3)–4.82 × 10(−2) copies per 16S rRNA, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of ARGs and MRGs in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of ARGs and MRGs in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant differences in the abundance or diversity of ARGs and MRGs between macroplastics biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition was the determining factor of the ARG profile but not for MRG. Some ARGs and MRGs had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles.","Yang Y., Liu G., Song W., Ye C., Lin H., Li Z., Liu W.",10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.061,Environment International
The Phenomenon Of Antibiotic Resistance In The Polar Regions: An Overview Of The Global Problem,"The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance is a global problem in human and animal health. This leads to a reduction in the therapeutic effectiveness of the measures used so far and to the limitation of treatment options, which may pose a threat to human health and life. The problem of phenomenon of antibiotic resistance affects more and more the polar regions. This is due to the increase in tourist traffic and the number of people staying at research stations, unmodernised sewage systems in inhabited areas, as well as the migration of animals or the movement of microplastics, which may contain resistant bacteria. Research shows that the presence of antibiotic resistance genes is more dominant in zones of human and wildlife influence than in remote areas. In a polluted environment, there is evidence of a direct correlation between human activity and the spread and survival of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Attention should be paid to the presence of resistance to synthetic and semi-synthetic antibiotics in the polar regions, which is likely to be correlated with human presence and activity, and possible steps to be taken. We need to understand many more aspects of this, such as bacterial epigenetics and environmental stress, in order to develop effective strategies for minimizing the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Studying the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in regions with less anthropogenic activity could provide insight into the diversity of primary genes and explain the historical evolution of antibiotic resistance.","Depta J., Niedźwiedzka-Rystwej P.",10.2147/IDR.S369023,Infection And Drug Resistance
Size Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistome And Core Microbiome In An Urban River,"Microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments provide a new ecological niche that facilitates the attachment of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. However, the effect of particle size on the colonization of antibiotic resistomes and pathogens remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study explored the antibiotic resistome and core microbiome on three distinct types of MPs including polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene (PS), with varying sizes of 30, 200, and 3000 μm by metagenomic sequencing. Our finding showed that the ARG abundances of the PS type increased by 4-folds with increasing particle size from 30 to 3000 μm, and significant differences in ARG profiles were found across the three MP types. In addition, the concentrations of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were markedly higher in the MPs than in the surrounding water, indicating their enrichment at these artificial interfaces. Notably, several pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Legionella pneumophila were enriched in MP biofilms, and the co-occurrence of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs)/MGEs suggested the presence of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant microbes with potential mobility. Both redundancy analysis (RDA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrated that physicochemical properties such as zeta potential, MP size, and contact angle were the most significant contributors to the antibiotic resistome. Strikingly, no significant differences were observed in the health risk scores of the ARG profiles among different sizes and types of MPs. This study expands our knowledge on the impact of MP size on microbial risks, thus enhancing our understanding of the potential health hazards they pose.","Lin W., Cao S., Wu Q., Xu F., Li R., Cui L.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170716,Science Of The Total Environment
Contribution Of Microplastic Particles To The Spread Of Resistances And Pathogenic Bacteria In Treated Wastewaters,"Microplastic Particles (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants widely found in aquatic ecosystems. Although MPs are mostly retained in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a high number of MPs reaches the open waters potentially contributing to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. Nowadays, a limited number of studies have focused on the role of MPs as carriers of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria in WWTPs. Thus, an investigation on the community composition (by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and the abundance of antibiotic and metal resistance genes (by qPCR) of the biofilm on MPs (the plastisphere) and of planktonic bacteria in treated (pre- and post-disinfection) wastewaters was performed. MPs resulted to be very similar in terms of type, color, size, and chemical composition, before and after the disinfection. The bacterial community on MPs differed from the planktonic community in terms of richness, composition, and structure of the community network. Potentially pathogenic bacteria generally showed higher abundances in treated wastewater than in the biofilm on MPs. Furthermore, among the tested resistance genes, only sul2 (a common resistance gene against sulfonamides) resulted to be more abundant in the plastisphere than in the planktonic bacterial community. Our results suggest that the wastewater plastisphere could promote the spread of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in aquatic environment although with a relatively lower contribution than the wastewater planktonic bacterial community.","Galafassi S., Sabatino R., Sathicq M.B., Eckert E.M., Fontaneto D., Dalla Fontana G., Mossotti R., Corno G., Volta P., Di Cesare A.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.117368,Water Research
Microplastics Can Selectively Enrich Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistant Genes And Shape Different Microbial Communities In Aquatic Systems,"Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminants, are posing potential risks to environment, and animal and human health. The ubiquitous presence of MPs in natural ecosystems provides favorable platform to selectively adsorb antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacteria (ARB) and bacterial assemblages, especially in wastewater which is hotspot for MPs, ARGs and ARB. In this study, the selective capture of intracellular ARGs (iARGs), extracellular ARGs (eARGs), and bacterial assemblages by MPs with different materials (i.e. polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, and polyethylene terephthalate) and sizes (200 μm and 100 μm) was investigated. The results showed that iARGs (i.e. i-TetA, i-TetC, i-TetO, i-sul1), integron-integrase gene (intI1), and eARGs (i.e. e-TetA and e-bla(TEM)) were selectively enriched on MPs. Relative abundances of i-sul1, i-TetA, and intI1 were generally higher than that of i-TetC and i-TetO on all MPs. Moreover, MPs also have strong effects on the formation of microflora in wastewater, which resulted in different bacterial communities and functions in the wastewater and on the MPs. These findings suggested that MPs could affect the selective enrichment of ARB and ARGs in water environment.","Zhang S., Liu X., Qiu P., Chen B., Xu C., Dong W., Liu T.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153488,Science Of The Total Environment
Bacterial Community Under The Influence Of Microplastics In Indoor Environment And The Health Hazards Associated With Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Selectively colonized microbial communities and enriched antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in (micro)plastics in aquatic and soil environments make the plastisphere a great health concern. Although microplastics (MPs) are distributed in indoor environments in high abundance, information on the effect of MPs on a microbial community in an indoor environment is lacking. Here, we detected polymers (containing MPs and natural polymers), bacterial communities, and 18 kinds of ARGs in collected indoor dust samples. A significant correlation by Procrustes analysis between bacterial community composition and the abundance of MPs was observed, and correlation tests and redundancy analysis identified specific associations between MP polymers and bacterial taxa, such as polyamide and Actinobacteria. In addition, the abundance of MPs showed a positive correlation with the relative abundance of the ARGs (to 16S RNA), while natural polymers, such as cellulosics, showed positive correlations with the absolute abundance of ARGs and 16S rRNA. Simulated experiments verified that significantly higher bacterial biomasses and ARGs were observed on the surface of cotton, hair, and wool than on MPs, while a higher relative abundance of ARGs was detected on MPs. However, a significantly higher amount of ARG was found on MPs of poly(lactic acid), the biodegradable plastics with the highest yield. In addition to the plastisphere in water and soil environments, MPs in an indoor environment may also affect the bacterial community and specifically enrich ARGs. Moreover, degradable MPs and nondegradable MPs may result in different health hazards due to their distinct effects on bacterial community.","Peng C., Zhang X., Zhang X., Liu C., Chen Z., Sun H., Wang L.",10.1021/acs.est.1c04520,Environmental Science And Technology
Discarded Masks As Hotspots Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Covid-19 Pandemic,"The demand for facial masks remains high. However, little is known about discarded masks as a potential refuge for contaminants and to facilitate enrichment and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment. We address this issue by conducting an in-situ time-series experiment to investigate the dynamic changes of ARGs, bacteria and protozoa associated with discarded masks. Masks were incubated in an estuary for 30 days. The relative abundance of ARGs in masks increased after day 7 but levelled off after 14 days. The absolute abundance of ARGs at 30 days was 1.29 × 10(12) and 1.07 × 10(12) copies for carbon and surgical masks, respectively. According to normalized stochasticity ratio analysis, the assembly of bacterial and protistan communities was determined by stochastic (NST = 62%) and deterministic (NST = 40%) processes respectively. A network analysis highlighted potential interactions between bacteria and protozoa, which was further confirmed by culture-dependent assays, that showed masks shelter and enrich microbial communities. An antibiotic susceptibility test suggested that antibiotic resistant pathogens co-exist within protozoa. This study provides an insight into the spread of ARGs through discarded masks and highlights the importance of managing discarded masks with the potential ecological risk of mask contamination.","Zhou S.-Y.-D., Lin C., Yang K., Yang L.-Y., Yang X.-R., Huang F.-Y., Neilson R., Su J.-Q., Zhu Y.-G.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127774,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Interaction Of Microbes With Microplastics And Nanoplastics In The Agroecosystems—Impact On Antimicrobial Resistance,"Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are hotspots for the exchange of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) between different bacterial taxa in the environment. Propagation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health issue that needs special attention concerning horizontal gene transfer (HGT) under micro-nano plastics (MNPs) pressure. Interactions between MNPs and microbes, or mere persistence of MNPs in the environment (either water or soil), influence microbial gene expressions, affecting autochthonous microbiomes, their resistomes, and the overall ecosystem. The adsorption of a range of co-contaminants on MNPs leads to the increased interaction of pollutants with microbes resulting in changes in AMR, virulence, toxin production, etc. However, accurately estimating the extent of MNP infestation in agroecosystems remains challenging. The main limitation in estimating the level of MNPs contamination in agroecosystems, surface and subsurface waters, or sediments is the lack of standardized protocols for extraction of MPs and analytical detection methods from complex high organic content matrices. Nonetheless, recent advances in MPs detection from complex matrices with high organic matter content are highly promising. This review aims to provide an overview of relevant information available to date and summarize the already existing knowledge about the mechanisms of MNP-microbe interactions including the different factors with influence on HGT and AMR. In-depth knowledge of the enhanced ARGs propagation in the environment under the influence of MNPs could raise the needed awareness, about future consequences and emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","Nath J., De J., Sur S., Banerjee P.",10.3390/pathogens12070888,Pathogens

"Impact Of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers, Antibiotic Consumption, And Other Measures On Detection Rates Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Rural Japanese Hospitals","There are limited data available on the relationship between multidrug-resistant bacteria and infection control activities in small to medium-sized hospitals. Therefore, we collected data on the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHSs), personal protective equipment, antibiotics, and the levels of detectable bacteria between April 2014 and March 2015 in 11 Japanese hospitals. Average total antibiotic consumption was 100 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days (PD), and average use of ABHSs, masks, plastic aprons, and gloves was 5 L per 1000 PD, and 1, 2, and 26 pieces per 1 PD, respectively. Average numbers of isolated (isolation rate) Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) were 107 (8% of total bacterial tests performed), 51 (4%), and 4 (0.3%), respectively. Multivariate analyses of ABHS and tazobactam/piperacillin consumption showed a significant negative association with the MRSA isolation rate (adjusted R(2) = 0.87). These findings suggest that hand hygiene is more important than antibiotic consumption in small to medium-sized hospitals.","Mitsuboshi S., Tsugita M.",10.1016/j.jiac.2018.08.013,Journal Of Infection And Chemotherapy
Exploring The Dynamics Of Antibiotic Resistome On Plastic Debris Traveling From The River To The Sea Along A Representative Estuary Based On Field Sequential Transfer Incubations,"The environmental risks arising from ubiquitous microplastics or plastic debris (PD) acting as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted widespread attention. Enormous amounts of plastic waste are transported by rivers and traverse estuaries into the sea every year. However, changes in the antibiotic resistome within the plastisphere (the biofilms formed on PD) as PD travels through estuaries are largely unknown. In this study, we performed sequential migration incubations for PD along Haihe Estuary to simulate the natural process of PD floating from rivers to the ocean. Metagenomic sequencing and analysis techniques were used to track microbial communities and antibiotic resistome on migrating PD and in seawater representing the marine environment. The total relative gene copies of ARGs on traveling PD remained stable. As migration between greatly varied waters, additional ARG subtypes were recruited to the plastisphere. Above 80 % ARG subtypes identified in the plastisphere were persistent throughout the migration, and over 30 % of these persistent ARGs were undetected in seawater. The bacterial hosts composition of ARGs on PD progressively altered as transported downstream. Human pathogenic bacteria carrying ARGs (HPBs-ARG) exhibited decreasing trends in abundance and species number during transfer. Individual HPBs-ARG persisted on transferred PD and were absent in seawater samples, comprising Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Based on all detected ARGs and HPBs-ARG, the Projection Pursuit model was applied to synthetically evaluate the potential risks of antibiotic resistance on migrating PD. Diminished risks on PD were observed upon the river-to-sea journey but consistently remained significantly higher than in seawater. The potential risks posed to marine environments by drifting PD as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistance deserve greater attention. Our results provide initial insights into the dynamics or stability of antibiotic resistome on PD crossing distinct aquatic systems in field estuaries.","Zhao X., Niu Z., Ma Y., Zhang Y., Li Y., Zhang R.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171464,Science Of The Total Environment
The Stress Response Of Tetracycline Resistance Genes And Bacterial Communities Under The Existence Of Microplastics In Typical Leachate Biological Treatment System,"Landfill leachate is an important source of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). Here, in the presence of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) and polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs), the nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect and sludge structure performance were affected in an anaerobic–anoxic–aerobic system, a typical biological leachate treatment process. The abundance of tetracycline-resistance genes (tet genes) in biofilms on the two types of MP was significantly higher than that in the leachate and sludge, and the load on PE-MPs was higher than that on PS-MPs because of the porous structure of PE-MPs. Aging of the MPs increased their surface roughness and abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and shaped the profile of ARGs in the MP biofilms. The biofilm biomass and growth rate on the two types of MP increased with the incubation time in the first 30 days, and was affected by environmental factors. Structural equation models and co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that the MPs indirectly affected the spectrum of ARGs by affecting biofilm formation, and, to a lesser extent, had a direct impact on the selective enrichment of ARGs. We discuss the mechanisms of the relationships between MPs and ARGs in the leachate treatment system, which will have guiding significance for future research. Our data on the colonization of microorganisms and tet genes in MPs biofilms provide new evidence concerning the accumulation and transmission of these ARGs, and are important for understanding the mechanisms of MPs in spreading pollution.","Li H., Lian Y., Li S., Yang M., Xie Q., Qiu L., Liu H., Long Y., Hu L., Fang C.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121865,Journal Of Environmental Management
Investigating The Impact Of Nanoplastics In Altering The Efficacy Of Clarithromycin Antibiotics Through In Vitro Studies,"Plastics have significant global implications due to their environmental contamination from extensive use and improper disposal. Among plastic particles, nanoplastics (<1 μm) pose notable risks to organisms and ecosystems due to their high surface area, reactivity, and potential to carry environmental pollutants. This study explores the interaction between polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and clarithromycin (CLA), a broad-spectrum antibiotic, focusing on their combined impact on insulin (INS) and antibiotic-resistant (AMR) bacteria. PSNPs can adsorb CLA, leading to structural changes in insulin and affecting its physiological functions, potentially causing insulin resistance. Additionally, PSNPs reduce CLA's inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria, facilitating antibiotic resistance. Our research utilized UV–Vis Spectroscopy, FTIR, Fluorescence spectroscopy, and Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to assess INS structural changes, alongside the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for microbiological examination. The findings highlight the synergistic and antagonistic effects of PSNPs and CLA, underscoring the enhanced toxicity of CLA when adsorbed onto PSNPs and the complex interactions affecting both human health and bacterial resistance. Further studies are essential to fully understand these mechanisms and their broader implications.","Pani B.S.U.L., Chandrasekaran N.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125144,Environmental Pollution
Microplastics Shape Microbial Interactions And Affect The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Different Full-Scale Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) pose a potential threat to the environment because of the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs). However, the interactions between ARGs and MPs, which have both indirect and direct effects on ARG dissemination in WWTPs, remain unclear. In this study, spatiotemporal variations in different types of MPs, ten ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetA, tetO, tetM, tetX, tetW, qnrS, ermB, and ermC), class 1 integron integrase (intI1) and transposon Tn916/1545 in three typical WWTPs were characterized. Sul1, tetO, and sul2 were the predominant ARGs in the targeted WWTPs, whereas the intI1 and transposon Tn916/1545 were positively correlated with most of the targeted ARGs. Saccharimonadales (4.15 %), Trichococcus (2.60 %), Nitrospira (1.96 %), Candidatus amarolinea (1.79 %), and SC-I-84 (belonging to phylum Proteobacteria) (1.78 %) were the dominant genera. Network and redundancy analyses showed that Trichococcus, Faecalibacterium, Arcobacter, and Prevotella copri were potential hosts of ARGs, whereas Candidatus campbellbacteria and Candidatus kaiserbacteria were negatively correlated with ARGs. The potential hosts of ARGs had a strong positive correlation with polyethylene terephthalate, silicone resin, and fluor rubber and a negative correlation with polyurethane. Candidatus campbellbacteria and Candidatus kaiserbacteria were positively correlated with polyurethane, whereas potential hosts of ARGs were positively correlated with polypropylene and fluor rubber. Structural equation modeling highlighted that intI1, transposon Tn916/1545 and microbial communities, particularly microbial diversity, dominated the dissemination of ARGs, whereas MPs had a significant positive correlation with microbial abundance. Our study deepens the understanding of the relationships between ARGs and MPs in WWTPs, which will be helpful in designing strategies for inhibiting ARG hosts in WWTPs.","Xu M., Chen M., Pan C., Xu R.-Z., Gao P., Chen H.-Q., Shen X.-X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168313,Science Of The Total Environment
"Plastisphere Characterization In Habitat Of The Highly Endangered Shinisaurus Crocodilurus: Bacterial Composition, Assembly, Function And The Comparison With Surrounding Environment","Plastisphere is a new niche for microorganisms that complicate the ecological effects of plastics, and may profoundly influence biodiversity and habitat conservation. The DaGuishan National Nature Reserve, one of the largest habitats of the highly endangered crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus), is experiencing plastic pollution without sufficient attention. Here, plastisphere collected from captive tanks of crocodile lizards in this nature reserve was characterized for the first time. Three types of plastic (PE-PP, PE1, and PE2) together with the surrounding water and soil samples, were collected, and 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to characterize the bacterial composition. The results demonstrated that plastisphere was driven by stochastic process and had a distinct bacterial community with higher diversity than that in surrounding water (p < 0.05). Bacteria related to nitrogen and carbon cycles (Pseudomonas psychrotolerans, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum) were more abundant in plastisphere than in water or soil (p < 0.05). More importantly, plastics recruited pathogens and those bacteria function in antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) coding. Bacteria related to polymer degradation also proliferated in plastisphere, especially Bacillus subtilis with a fold change of 42.01. The PE2 plastisphere, which had the lowest diversity and was dominated by Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum differed from PE 1 and PE-PP plastispheres totally. Plastics' morphology and aquatic nutrient levels contributed to the heterogeneity of different plastispheres. Overall, this study demonstrated that plastispheres diversify in composition and function, affecting ecosystem services directly or indirectly. Pathogens and bacteria related to ARGs expression enriched in the plastisphere should not be ignored because they may threaten the health of crocodile lizards by increasing the risk of infection. Plastic pollution control should be included in conservation efforts for crocodile lizards. This study provides new insights into the potential impacts of plastisphere, which is important for ecological risk assessments of plastic pollution in the habitats of endangered species.","Xie M., Lv M., Zhao Z., Li L., Jiang H., Yu Y., Zhang X., Liu P., Chen J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165807,Science Of The Total Environment
Regulation Of Args Abundance By Biofilm Colonization On Microplastics Under Selective Pressure Of Antibiotics In River Water Environment,"Interactions of microplastics (MPs) biofilm with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics in aquatic environments have made microplastic biofilm an issue of keen scholarly interest. The process of biofilm formation and the degree of ARGs enrichment in the presence of antibiotic-selective pressure and the impact on the microbial community need to be further investigated. In this paper, the selective pressure of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and illumination conditions were investigated to affect the physicochemical properties, biomass, and extracellular polymer secretion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic biofilm. In addition, relative copy numbers of nine ARGs were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In the presence of CIP, microorganisms in the water and microplastic biofilm were more inclined to carry associated ARGs (2–3 times higher), which had a contributing effect on ARGs enrichment. The process of pre-microplastic biofilm formation might have an inhibitory effect on ARGs (total relative abundance up to 0.151) transfer and proliferation compared to the surrounding water (total relative abundance up to 0.488). However, in the presence of CIP stress, microplastic biofilm maintained the abundance of ARGs (from 0.151 to 0.149) better compared to the surrounding water (from 0.488 to 0.386). Therefore, microplastic biofilm act as abundance buffer island of ARGs stabilizing the concentration of ARGs. In addition, high-throughput analyses showed the presence of antibiotic-resistant (Pseudomonas) and pathogenic (Vibrio) microorganisms in biofilm under different conditions. The above research deepens our understanding of ARGs enrichment in biofilm and provides important insights into the ecological risks of interactions between ARGs, antibiotics, and microplastic biofilm.","Zheng Z., Wang X., Zhang W., Wang L., Lyu H., Tang J.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120402,Journal Of Environmental Management
Watershed Urbanization Enhances The Enrichment Of Pathogenic Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In The Water Environment,"Microplastics (MPs) serve as vectors for microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and contribute to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs across various environments. Patterns of microbial communities and ARGs in the biofilm on the surface of MPs, also termed as plastisphere, have become an issue of global concern. Although antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere has been detected, how watershed urbanization affects patterns of potential pathogens and ARGs in the microplastic biofilms is still unclear. Here, we compared the bacterial communities, the interaction between bacterial taxa, pathogenic bacteria, and ARGs between the plastisphere and their surrounding water, and revealed the extensive influence of urbanization on them. Our results showed that bacterial communities and interactions in the plastisphere differed from those in their surrounding water. Microplastics selectively enriched Bacteroidetes from water. In non-urbanized area, the abundance of Oxyphotobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than that in water, while α-Proteobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than those in water of urbanized area. Pathogenic bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urbanized area than those in non-urbanized area. MPs selectively enriched ARG-carrying potential pathogens, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, and exhibited a distinct effect on the relative abundance of ARG and pathogens in water with different urbanization levels. We further found ARGs were significantly correlated to MGEs and pathogenic bacteria. These results suggested that MPs would promote the dissemination of ARGs among microbes including pathogenic bacteria, and urbanization would affect the impact of MPs on microbes, pathogens, and ARGs in water. A high level of urbanization could enhance the enrichment of pathogens and ARGs by MPs in aquatic systems and increase microbial risk in aquatic environments. Our findings highlighted the necessity of controlling the spread of ARGs among pathogens and the usage of plastic products in ecosystems of urban areas.","Li H., Luo Q., Zhao S., Zhao P., Yang X., Huang Q., Su J.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120185,Environmental Pollution
Microplastic Biodegradability Dependent Responses Of Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistance To Simulated Freshwater-Seawater Shift In Onshore Marine Aquaculture Zones,"MPs carrying ARGs can travel between freshwater and seawater due to intensive land-sea interaction in onshore marine aquaculture zones (OMAZ). However, the response of ARGs in plastisphere with different biodegradability to freshwater-seawater shift is still unknown. In this study, ARG dynamics and associated microbiota on biodegradable poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were investigated through a simulated freshwater-seawater shift. The results exhibited that freshwater-seawater shift significantly influenced ARG abundance in plastisphere. The relative abundance of most studied ARGs decreased rapidly in plastisphere after they entered seawater from freshwater but increased on PBAT after MPs entered freshwater from seawater. Besides, the high relative abundance of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes occurred in plastisphere, and the co-change between most ARGs and mobile genetic elements indicated the role of horizontal gene transfer on ARG regulation. Proteobacteria was dominant phylum in plastisphere and the dominant genera, such as Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Afipia, Gemmobacter and Enhydrobacter, were significantly associated with qnrS, tet and MDR genes in plastisphere. Moreover, after MPs entered new water environment, the ARGs and microbiota genera in plastisphere changed significantly and tended to converge with those in receiving water. These results indicated that MP biodegradability and freshwater-seawater interaction influenced potential hosts and distributions of ARGs, of which biodegradable PBAT posed a high risk in ARG dissemination. This study would be helpful for understanding the impact of biodegradable MP pollution on spread of antibiotic resistance in OMAZ.","Zhou Q., Zhang J., Fang Q., Zhang M., Wang X., Zhang D., Pan X.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121828,Environmental Pollution
"Limited Evidence Of Spillover Of Antimicrobial-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae From Animal/Environmental Reservoirs To Humans In Vellore, India","Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common opportunistic pathogen in humans, often associated with both virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes. K. pneumoniae have a highly plastic genome and can act as a vehicle for disseminating genetic information. Aiming to assess the impact of the human-animal-environment interface on AMR dissemination in K. pneumoniae we sampled and genome sequenced organisms from a range of environments and compared their genetic composition. Methods: Representative K. pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens (n = 59), livestock samples (n = 71), and hospital sewage samples (n = 16) during a two-year surveillance study were subjected to whole genome sequencing. We compared the taxonomic and genomic distribution of K. pneumoniae, AMR gene abundance, virulence gene composition, and mobile genetic elements between the three sources. Results: The K. pneumoniae isolates originating from livestock were clonally distinct from those derived from clinical/hospital effluent samples. Notably, the clinical and hospital sewage isolates typically possessed a greater number of resistance/virulence genes than those from animals. Overall, we observed a limited overlap of K. pneumoniae clones, AMR genes, virulence determinants, and plasmids between the different settings. Conclusion: In this setting, the spread of XDR and hypervirulent clones of K. pneumoniae appears to be restricted to humans with no obvious association with non-clinical sources. Emergent clones of K. pneumoniae carrying both resistance and virulence determinants are likely to have emerged in hospital settings rather than in animal or natural environments. These data challenge the current view of AMR transmission in K. pneumoniae in a One-Health context.","Jacob J.J., Aravind V., Beresford-Jones B.S., Lal Y.B., Shankar C., Yesudoss M., Abdullah F., Priya T.M., Kulkarni S., Baker S., Veeraraghavan B., Walia K.",10.1007/s44197-024-00323-4,Journal Of Epidemiology And Global Health
In Vitro Antibiofilm And Anti-Adhesion Effects Of Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticles Against Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria,"The aim of the current investigation was to determine the antibacterial and antibiofilm potential of MgO nanoparticles (NPs) against antibiotic-resistant clinical strains of bacteria. MgO NPs were synthesized by a wet chemical method and further characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray. Antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution and agar diffusion methods. The Bradford method was used to assess cellular protein leakage as a result of loss of membrane integrity. Microtiter plate assay following crystal violet staining was employed to determine the effect of MgO NPs on biofilm formation and removal of established biofilms. MIC values ranged between 125 and 500 μg/mL. Moreover, treatment with MgO NPs accelerated rate of membrane disruption, measured as a function of leakage of cellular proteins. Leakage of cellular protein content was greater among gram-negative bacteria. Cell adherence assay indicated 25.3–49.8% inhibition of bacterial attachment to plastic surfaces. According to a static biofilm method, MgO NPs reduced biofilm formation potential from 31% to 82.9% in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, NPs also significantly reduced the biomass of 48, 72, 96 and 120 hr old biofilms (P < 0.05). Cytotoxicity experiments using a neutral red assay revealed that MgO NPs are non-toxic to HeLa cells at concentrations of 15–120 μg/mL. These data provide in vitro scientific evidence that MgO NPs are effective and safe antibiofilm agents that inhibit adhesion, biofilm formation and removal of established biofilms of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","Hayat S., Muzammil S., Rasool M.H., Nisar Z., Hussain S.Z., Sabri A.N., Jamil S.",10.1111/1348-0421.12580,Microbiology And Immunology
Exposure To Heavy Metal And Antibiotic Enriches Antibiotic Resistant Genes On The Tire Particles In Soil,"The widespread occurrence of tire particles (TPs) in soils has attracted considerable attention due to their potential threats. The assemblage of bacteria and associated antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) on TPs is yet largely unknown, especially under the stress of soil pollutants. In the present study, TPs were incubated in soils with or without the stress of heavy metal (Cu(2+)) or/and antibiotic (tetracycline), and bacterial community and ARG profile on TPs and in soils were explored using high-throughput sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR. Results indicated that bacterial community structure on TPs was significantly different from the surrounding soils, with a lower diversity, and significantly shifted by heavy metal and antibiotic exposure. Additionally, a diverse set of ARGs were detected on TPs, and their abundances were significantly increased under the stress of heavy metal and antibiotic, revealing a strong synergistic effect. Moreover, a good fit was observed for the correlation between bacterial community and ARG profile on TPs. Taken together, this study, for the first time, demonstrates that TPs can provide a novel niche for soil bacteria and soil resistome, and heavy metal and antibiotic exposure may potentially increase the abundance of ARGs on TPs, threatening soil ecosystems and human health.","Ding J., Zhu D., Wang Y., Wang H., Liang A., Sun H., Chen Q., Lassen S.B., Lv M., Chen L.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148417,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastic-Mediated Transfer Of Tetracycline Resistance: Unveiling The Role Of Mussels In Marine Ecosystems,"The global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is exacerbated by the mobilization of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) occurring in different environmental niches, including seawater. Marine environments serve as reservoirs for resistant bacteria and ARGs, further complicated by the ubiquity of microplastics (MPs). MPs can adsorb pollutants and promote bacterial biofilm formation, creating conditions favorable to the dissemination of ARGs. This study explores the dynamics of ARG transfer in the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis within a seawater model, focusing on the influence of polyethylene MPs on the mobilization of the Tn916-carrying tetM gene and plasmid-encoded ermB. Experiments revealed that biofilm formation on MPs by Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes facilitated the transfer of the tetM resistance gene, but not the ermB gene. Furthermore, the presence of MPs significantly increased the conjugation frequency of tetM within mussels, indicating that MPs enhance the potential for ARG mobilization in marine environments. These findings highlight the role of MPs and marine organisms in ARG spread, underscoring the ecological and public health implications.","Milani G., Cortimiglia C., Belloso Daza M.V., Greco E., Bassi D., Cocconcelli P.S.",10.3390/antibiotics13080727,Antibiotics
"Bacterial Biofilms Colonizing Plastics In Estuarine Waters, With An Emphasis On Vibrio Spp. And Their Antibacterial Resistance","Since plastics degrade very slowly, they remain in the environment on much longer timescales than most natural organic substrates and provide a novel habitat for colonization by bacterial communities. The spectrum of relationships between plastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. The first objective of this study was to examine plastics as substrates for communities of Bacteria in estuarine surface waters. We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize communities from plastics collected in the field, and over the course of two colonization experiments, from biofilms that developed on plastic (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene) and glass substrates placed in the environment. Both field sampling and colonization experiments were conducted in estuarine tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. As a second objective, we concomitantly analyzed biofilms on plastic substrates to ascertain the presence and abundance of Vibrio spp. bacteria, then isolated three human pathogens, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus, and determined their antibiotic-resistant profiles. In both components of this study, we compared our results with analyses conducted on paired samples of estuarine water. This research adds to a nascent literature that suggests environmental factors govern the development of bacterial communities on plastics, more so than the characteristics of the plastic substrates themselves. In addition, this study is the first to culture three pathogenic vibrios from plastics in estuaries, reinforcing and expanding upon earlier reports of plastic pollution as a habitat for Vibrio species. The antibiotic resistance detected among the isolates, coupled with the longevity of plastics in the aqueous environment, suggests biofilms on plastics have potential to persist and serve as focal points of potential pathogens and horizontal gene transfer.","Laverty A.L., Primpke S., Lorenz C., Gerdts G., Dobbs F.C.",10.1371/journal.pone.0237704,Plos One
Selection For Antimicrobial Resistance In The Plastisphere,"Microplastics and antimicrobials are widespread contaminants that threaten global systems and frequently co-exist in the presence of human or animal pathogens. Whilst the impact of each of these contaminants has been studied in isolation, the influence of this co-occurrence in driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in microplastic-adhered microbial communities, known as ‘the Plastisphere’, is not well understood. This review proposes the mechanisms by which interactions between antimicrobials and microplastics may drive selection for AMR in the Plastisphere. These include: 1) increased rates of horizontal gene transfer in the Plastisphere compared with free-living counterparts and natural substrate controls due to the proximity of cells, co-occurrence of environmental microplastics with AMR selective compounds and the sequestering of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes in the biofilm matrix. 2) An elevated AMR selection pressure in the Plastisphere due to the adsorbing of AMR selective or co-selective compounds to microplastics at concentrations greater than those found in surrounding mediums and potentially those adsorbed to comparator particles. 3) AMR selection pressure may be further elevated in the Plastisphere due to the incorporation of antimicrobial or AMR co-selective chemicals in the plastic matrix during manufacture. Implications for both ecological functioning and environmental risk assessments are discussed, alongside recommendations for further research.","Stevenson E.M., Buckling A., Cole M., Lindeque P.K., Murray A.K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168234,Science Of The Total Environment
Selective Enrichment Of High-Risk Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Priority Pathogens In Freshwater Plastisphere: Unique Role Of Biodegradable Microplastics,"Microplastics (MPs) has been concerned as emerging vectors for spreading antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in aquatic environments, but the role of biodegradable MPs remains largely unknown. Herein, field in-situ incubation method combined with metagenomic sequencing were employed to reveal the dispersal characteristics of microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and virulence factors (VFs) enriched by MPs biofilms. Results showed that planktonic microbes were more prone to enrich on biodegradable MPs (i.e., polyhydroxyalkanoate and polylactic acid) than non-biodegradable MPs (i.e., polystyrene, polypropylene and polyethylene). Distinctive microbial communities were assembled on biodegradable MPs, and the abundances of ARGs, MGEs, and VFs on biofilms of biodegradable MPs were much higher than that of non-biodegradable MPs. Notably, network analysis showed that the biodegradable MPs selectively enriched pathogens carrying ARGs, VFs and MGEs concurrently, suggesting a strong potential risks of co-spreading antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity through horizontal gene transfer. According to WHO priority list of Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens (ARPs) and ARGs health risk assessment framework, the highest abundances of Priority 1 ARPs and Rank I risk ARGs were found on polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoate, respectively. These findings elucidate the unique and critical role of biodegradable MPs for selective enrichment of high-risk ARGs and priority pathogens in freshwater environments.","Wang F., Hu Z., Wang W., Wang J., Xiao Y., Shi J., Wang C., Mai W., Li G., An T.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135901,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Covid-19 And Antimicrobial Resistance: A Cross-Study,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as a severe concern due to the escalating instances of resistant human pathogens encountered by health workers. Consequently, there is a shortage of antibiotics to treat Multidrug Resistance (MDR) and Extensively Drug Resistance (XDR) patients. The primary cause of AMR is the vast array of anthropogenic disturbances in natural microfauna brought about by the extensive use of antibiotics. Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has crashed antibiotic stewardship and single-handedly increased the global usage of antibiotics, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and biocide, causing a ripple effect in the existing global AMR problem. This surge in antibiotic usage has escalated the residual antibiotics reaching Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) from pharmaceutical companies, health care centers, and domestic settings. Ultimately the natural water bodies receiving their effluents will have higher concentrations of emerging contaminants as the WWTPs cannot remove the Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) completely. Furthermore, increased biocides usage will increase AMR by co-resistance, and increasing plastics will turn into microplastics and get converted to plastisphere, which will further enhance its propagation. Therefore, it is crucial to curb antibiotic usage, implement antibiotic stewardship dynamically; and, ameliorate the present condition of WWTPs to remove residual PPCPs efficiently. The need of the hour is to address the grave threat of AMR, which is loitering silently; if not the mankind will endure more affliction hereafter.","Rizvi S.G., Ahammad S.Z.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150873,Science Of The Total Environment
Changes In Tetracycline Partitioning And Bacteria/Phage-Comediated Args In Microplastic-Contaminated Greenhouse Soil Facilitated By Sophorolipid,"The emerging mixed contamination of antibiotics and microplastics in greenhouse soil has made the control of antibiotic resistant gene (ARG) transmission a novel challenge. In this work, surfactant sophorolipid was applied to enhance the dissipation of tetracycline (TC) and tet genes in the presence of microplastics in greenhouse soil. During 49 days of incubation, soil bacteria and phages were both found to be the crucial reservoirs of ARGs. Meanwhile, microplastic's presence significantly inhibited the dissipation of TC and ARGs in the soil. However, sophorolipid application was proved to outweigh the negative impact caused by microplastic existence, and lead to the highest dissipation of soil TC and ARGs. Significant positive correlation was detected between the dissipation rate of water-soluble and exchangeable TC content and bacteria/phage co-mediated ARG levels. This also held true between the two fractions of soil TC and the ratio of ARG level in the bacteria to that in the phages (B(ARGs)/P(ARGs)). The opposite impacts of microplastic presence and sophorolipid amendment on the TC/ARG dissipation found in this work provides new information for understanding ARG transmission between bacteria and phages in the mixed contaminated greenhouse soil.","Sun M., Ye M., Jiao W., Feng Y., Yu P., Liu M., Jiao J., He X., Liu K., Zhao Y., Wu J., Jiang X., Hu F.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.11.036,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Selection Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Biodegradable And Non-Biodegradable Microplastics,"Growing evidence have demonstrated that microplastics in the marine ecosystem can provide novel substrates for biofilm formation, potentially facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the biofilm on microplastics has not been fully explored. This study used the metagenomic data of biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics staged at a coastal lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico to profile the ARGs and their bacterial hosts. The abundance and Shannon diversity of ARGs on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate (PHA) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have no significant differences. Nevertheless, the abundance of multidrug resistance genes on PET (3.05 copies per 16S rRNA) was statistically higher than that on PHA (2.05). Beta diversity showed that the overall pattern of resistome on PHA was significantly distinct with that on PET. Procrustes analysis suggested a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition. The host-tracking analysis identified that Pseudomonas was always the major host for glycopeptide and multidrug resistance genes in PET and PHA biofilms, whereas the primary host for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) changed to Desulfovibrio on PET. This study provided the first metagenomic insights into the ARGs and their hosts on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics, suggesting that both two types of plastics harbor ARGs with preferences.","Sun Y., Cao N., Duan C., Wang Q., Ding C., Wang J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124979,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Simultaneous Dissemination Of Nanoplastics And Antibiotic Resistance By Nematode Couriers,"Nanoplastics (NPs) are increasingly recognized as a newly emerging pollutant in the environment. NPs can enable the colonization of microbial pathogens on their surfaces and adsorb toxic pollutants, such as heavy metals and residual antibiotics. Although the dissemination of plastic particles in water bodies and the atmosphere is widely studied, the dissemination of NPs and adsorbed pollutants on land, via biological means, is poorly understood. Since soil animals, such as the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), are highly mobile, this raises the possibility that they play an active role in disseminating NPs and adsorbed pollutants. Here, we established that antibiotic-resistant bacteria could aggregate with antibiotic-adsorbed NPs to form antibiotic-adsorbed NP-antibiotic resistant bacteria (ANP-ARB) aggregates, using polymyxins (colistin) as a proof-of-concept. Colistin-resistant mcr-1 bearing Escherichia coli from a mixed population of resistant and sensitive bacteria selectively aggregate with colistin-ANPs. In the soil microcosm, C. elegans fed on ANP-ARB clusters, resulting in the rapid spread of ANP-ARB by the nematodes across the soil at a rate of 40-60 cm per day. Our work revealed insights into how NPs could still disseminate across the soil faster than previously thought by “hitching a ride” in soil animals and acting as agents of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and antibiotic contaminants. This poses direct risks to ecology, agricultural sustainability, and human health.","Chan S.Y., Liu S.Y., Wu R., Wei W., Fang J.K., Chua S.L.",10.1021/acs.est.2c07129,Environmental Science And Technology
Emergence Of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci From Vancomycin-Susceptible Enterococci In Hospitalized Patients Under Antimicrobial Therapy,"Objectives: Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens with plastic genomes that evolve, acquire, and transmit antimicrobial-resistant determinants such as vancomycin resistance clusters. While vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as successful nosocomial pathogens, the mechanism by which vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) transform to VRE in hospitalized patients remains understudied. Methods: Genomes of Enterococcus faecium from two critically ill hospitalized patients subjected to multiple antibiotic therapies, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, were investigated. To identify mechanisms of resistance evolution, genomes of vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates were compared. Results: While VSE isolates were initially identified, VRE strains emerged post-vancomycin therapy. Comparative genomics revealed horizontal transmission of mobile genetic elements containing the Tn1549 transposon, which harbours the vanB-type vancomycin resistance gene cluster. This suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotic stress promoted the transfer of resistance-conferring elements, presumably from another gut inhabitant. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies investigating VSE and VRE isolates from the same patient. The mechanism of transmission and the within-patient evolution of vancomycin resistance via mobile genetic elements under antibiotic stress is illustrated. Our findings serve as a foundation for future studies building on this knowledge which can further elucidate the dynamics of antibiotic stress, resistance determinant transmission, and interactions within the gut microbiota.","Janice J., Wagner T.M., Olsen K., Hegstad J., Hegstad K.",10.1016/j.jgar.2023.12.010,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
Metagenomic Insights Into Ecological Risk Of Antibiotic Resistome And Mobilome In Riverine Plastisphere Under Impact Of Urbanization,"Microplastics (MPs) are of increasing concern due to their role as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. To date, few studies have explored the influence of anthropogenic activities on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within various riverine MPs, in comparison to their natural counterparts. Here an in-situ incubation was conducted along heavily anthropogenically-impacted Houxi River to characterize the geographical pattern of antibiotic resistome, mobilome and pathogens inhabiting MPs- and leaf-biofilms. The metagenomics result showed a clear urbanization-driven profile in the distribution of ARGs, MGEs and pathogens, with their abundances sharply increasing 4.77 to 19.90 times from sparsely to densely populated regions. The significant correlation between human fecal marker crAssphage and ARG (R(2) = 0.67, P=0.003) indicated the influence of anthropogenic activity on ARG proliferation in plastisphere and natural leaf surfaces. And mantel tests and random forest analysis revealed the impact of 17 socio-environmental factors, e.g., population density, antibiotic concentrations, and pore volume of materials, on the dissemination of ARGs. Partial least squares-path modeling further unveiled that intensifying human activities not only directly boosted ARGs abundance but also exerted a comparable indirect impact on ARGs propagation. Furthermore, the polyvinylchloride plastisphere created a pathogen-friendly habitat, harboring higher abundances of ARGs and MGEs, while polylactic acid are not likely to serve as vectors for pathogens in river, with a lower resistome risk score than that in leaf-biofilms. This study highlights the diverse ecological risks associated with the dissemination of ARGs and pathogens in varied MPs, offering insights for the policymaking of usage and control of plastics within urbanization.","Yan W., Bai R., Zhang Q., Jiang Y., Chen G., Zhang Y., Wu Y., Guo X., Xiao Y., Zhao F.",10.1016/j.envint.2024.108946,Environment International
Poly(L-Ornithine)-Grafted Zinc Phthalocyanines As Dual-Functional Antimicrobial Agents With Intrinsic Membrane Damage And Photothermal Ablation Capacity,"Multifunctional antimicrobial peptides that combine the intrinsic microbicidal property of cationic polypeptide chains and additional antibacterial strategy hold promising applications for the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially ""superbugs"". In the present study, star-shaped copolymers ZnPc-g-PLO with a zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) core and four poly(l-ornithine) (PLO) arms were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as dual-functional antimicrobial agents, that is, intrinsic membrane damage and photothermal ablation capacity. In an aqueous solution, amphiphilic ZnPc-g-PLO molecules self-assemble into nanosized polymeric micelles with an aggregated ZnPc core and star-shaped PLO periphery, where the ZnPc core exhibits appreciable aggregation-induced photothermal conversion efficiency. In the absence of laser irradiation, ZnPc-g-PLO micelles display potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activities via physical bacterial membrane disruption as a result of the high cationic charge density of the star-shaped PLO. Upon laser irradiation, significant improvement in bactericidal potency was realized due to the efficacious photothermal sterilization from the ZnPc core. Notably, ZnPc-g-PLO micelles did not induce drug-resistance upon subinhibitory passages. In summary, dual-functional ZnPc-g-PLO copolymers can serve as promising antibacterial agents for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Zheng M., Lin H., Zhang W., Tang S., Liu D., Cai J.",10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00392,Acs Infectious Diseases
Slower Antibiotics Degradation And Higher Resistance Genes Enrichment In Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) are increasingly entering the urban aquatic ecosystems, and the environmental significance and health risks of plastisphere, a special biofilm on MPs, have received widespread attention. In this study, MPs of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and quartzite were incubated in an urban water environment, and the tetracycline (TC) degradation ability was compared. Approximatedly 24% of TC biodegraded in 28 d in the water-quartzite system, which is significantly higher than that in the water-PLA (17.3%) and water-PVC systems (16.7%). Re-incubation of microorganisms in biofilms affirmed that quartzite biofilm has a higher TC degradation capacity than the plastisphere. According to high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenomic analysis, quartzite biofilm contained more abundant potential TC degrading bacteria, genes related to TC degradation (eutG, aceE, and DLAT), and metabolic pathways related to TC degradation. An oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface might lead to the higher metabolic capacity of quartzite biofilm for unconventional carbons, e.g., TC. It is also found that, compared with quartzite biofilm, the distinct microbes in the plastisphere carried more antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Higher affinity of MPs surface to antibiotics may lead to higher antibiotics stress on the plastisphere, which further amplify the carrying capacity for ARGs of microorganisms in the plastisphere. Compared to the nondegradable PVC MPs, surface of the biodegradable PLA plastics harbored significantly higher amounts of biomass and ARGs. Compared to the mineral particles, the capability of plastisphere has lower ability to degrade unconventional carbon sources such as the refractory organic pollutants, due to the abundance of carbon sources (adsorbed organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon) on the MPs surface. Meanwhile, the stronger adsorption capacity for pollutants also leads to higher pollutant stress (such as antibiotic stress) in plastisphere, which in turn affects the microbiological characteristics of the plastisphere itself, such as carrying more ARGs.","Wang J., Peng C., Dai Y., Li Y., Jiao S., Ma X., Liu X., Wang L.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118920,Water Research
Photoaged Microplastics Enhanced The Antibiotic Resistance Dissemination In Wwtps By Altering The Adsorption Behavior Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids,"Growing concerns have raised about the microplastic eco-coronas in the ultraviolet (UV) disinfection wastewater, which accelerated the pollution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the aquatic environment. As the hotspot of gene exchange, microplastics (MPs), especially for the UV-aged MPs, could alter the spread of ARGs in the eco-coronas and affect the resistance of the environment through adsorbing antibiotic resistant plasmids (ARPs). However, the relationship between the MP adsorption for ARPs and ARG spreading characteristics in MP eco-corona remain unclear. Herein, this study explored the distribution of ARGs in the MP eco-corona through in situ investigations of the discharged wastewater, and the adsorption behaviors of MPs for ARPs by in vitro adsorption experiments and in silico calculations. Results showed that the adsorption capacity of MPs for ARPs was enhanced by 42.7–48.0 % and the adsorption behavior changed from monolayer to multilayer adsorption after UV-aging. It was related to the increased surface roughness and oxygen-containing functional groups of MPs under UV treatment. Moreover, the abundance of ARGs in MP eco-corona of UV-treated wastewater was 1.33–1.55 folds higher than that without UV treatment, promoting the proliferation of drug resistance. DFT and DLVO theoretical calculations indicated that the MP-ARP interactions were dominated by electrostatic physical adsorption, endowing the aged MPs with low potential oxygen-containing groups to increase the electrostatic interaction with ARPs. Besides, due to the desorption of ARPs on MPs driven by the electrostatic repulsion, the bioavailability of ARGs in the MP eco-coronas was increased with pH and decreased with salinity after the wastewater discharge. Overall, this study advanced the understanding of the adsorption behavior of MPs for ARPs and provided inspirations for the evaluation of the resistance spread in the aquatic environment mediated by MP eco-coronas.","Guo Q., Wang M., Jin S., Ni H., Wang S., Chen J., Zhao W., Fang Z., Li Z., Liu H.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170824,Science Of The Total Environment
Incomplete Degradation Of Aromatic–Aliphatic Copolymer Leads To Proliferation Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Biodegradable plastics (BDPs) have attracted extensive attention as an alternative to conventional plastics. BDPs could be mineralized by composting, while the quality of compost affected by the presence of BDPs and the residual microplastics (MPs) has not been well evaluated. This study aimed to explore the MPs release potential and environmental implications of commercial BDPs (aromatic−aliphatic copolymer) films in uncontrolled composting. Results showed that the molecular weight of BDPs decreased by >60% within 60 d. However, the non-extracted organic matter and wet-sieving measurements indicated that MPs continuously released and accumulated during regular composting. The average MPs release potential (0.1–5 mm) was 134.6 ± 18.1 particles/mg (BDPs), which resulted in 10(3)–10(4) particles/g dw in compost. The plastisphere of MPs showed a significantly higher (0.95–16.76 times) abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which resulted in the rising (1.34–2.24 times) of ARGs in compost heaps, in comparison to the control groups. Overall, BDPs promote the spread of ARGs through the selective enrichment of bacteria and horizontal transfer from released MPs. These findings confirmed that BDPs could enhance the release potential of MPs and the dissemination of ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding and environmental risk of BDPs.","Zhang Y., Tao J., Bai Y., Wang F., Xie B.",10.1016/j.envint.2023.108291,Environment International
"Antibiotic Resistance Patterns Of Gram-Negative And Gram-Positive Strains Isolated From Inpatients With Nosocomial Infections In A Tertiary Hospital In Beijing, China From 2011 To 2014","This study was to evaluate the resistance of antimicrobial agents against pathogens from inpatients with nosocomial infection collected in Beijing, China, during 2011–2014. Measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was carried out using the broth microdilution method with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines as the indicator. A total of 5442 Gram-negative and 806 Gram-positive isolates were collected in this study in 2011–2014. Two carbapenem-resistant strains appeared among Escherichia coli (E. coli), while imipenem-resistant isolates increased in proportion from 0% to 8.2% among Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) during 4 year. Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) revealed severe antibacterial resistance to most antimicrobial agents. In contrast, a decreasing trend on resistance had been observed among Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) especially after 2012, range from 1.8% for co-trimoxazole to 13.5% for piperacillin. The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) also had the lowest resistant to linezolid and vancomycin (0.1%). In summary, antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens have gradually increased from 2011 to 2014, so improved surveillance of hospital-acquired infections and effective infection-control measures may be the best way to solve the present problem.","Zhu X., Tong A., Wang D., Sun H., Chen L., Dong M.",10.1080/1120009X.2016.1157946,Journal Of Chemotherapy
"Taxonomic Variation, Plastic Degradation, And Antibiotic Resistance Traits Of Plastisphere Communities In The Maturation Pond Of A Wastewater Treatment Plant","Wastewater treatment facilities can filter out some plastics before they reach the open environment, yet microplastics often persist throughout these systems. As they age, microplastics in wastewater may both leach and sorb pollutants and fragment to provide an increased surface area for bacterial attachment and conjugation, possibly impacting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) traits. Despite this, little is known about the effects of persistent plastic pollution on microbial functioning. To address this knowledge gap, we deployed five different artificially weathered plastic types and a glass control into the final maturation pond of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Ōtautahi-Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand. We sampled the plastic-associated biofilms (plastisphere) at 2, 6, 26, and 52 weeks, along with the ambient pond water, at three different depths (20, 40, and 60 cm from the pond water surface). We investigated the changes in plastisphere microbial diversity and functional potential through metagenomic sequencing. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes composition did not vary among plastic types and glass controls (P = 0.997) but varied among sampling times [permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), P = 0.001] and depths (PERMANOVA, P = 0.011). Overall, there was no polymer-substrate specificity evident in the total composition of genes (PERMANOVA, P = 0.67), but sampling time (PERMANOVA, P = 0.002) and depth were significant factors (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001). The plastisphere housed diverse AMR gene families, potentially influenced by biofilm-meditated conjugation. The plastisphere also harbored an increased abundance of genes associated with the biodegradation of nylon, or nylon-associated substances, including nylon oligomer-degrading enzymes and hydrolases.IMPORTANCEPlastic pollution is pervasive and ubiquitous. Occurrences of plastics causing entanglement or ingestion, the leaching of toxic additives and persistent organic pollutants from environmental plastics, and their consequences for marine macrofauna are widely reported. However, little is known about the effects of persistent plastic pollution on microbial functioning. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing provides us with the necessary tools to examine broad-scale community functioning to further investigate how plastics influence microbial communities. This study provides insight into the functional consequence of continued exposure to waste plastic by comparing the prokaryotic functional potential of biofilms on five types of plastic [linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), nylon-6, polyethylene terephthalate, polylactic acid, and oxygen-degradable LLDPE], glass, and ambient pond water over 12 months and at different depths (20, 40, and 60 cm) within a tertiary maturation pond of a municipal wastewater treatment plant.","Maday S.D.M., Kingsbury J.M., Weaver L., Pantos O., Wallbank J.A., Doake F., Masterton H., Hopkins M., Dunlop R., Gaw S., Theobald B., Risani R., Abbel R., Smith D., Handley K.M., Lear G.",10.1128/aem.00715-24,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Hidden Threats In The Plastisphere: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales Colonizing Microplastics In River Water,"Carbapenem resistance poses a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as potential contributors to antibiotic resistance spread in the environment. However, the link between MPs and carbapenem resistance remains unexplored. We investigated the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria colonizing MPs placed in a river. Three replicates of a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and of PET alone were placed both upstream and downstream a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) were further characterized by phenotypic tests and whole-genome sequencing. The abundance of carbapenem-resistant bacteria on MPs increased significantly downstream the WWTP. Their prevalence was higher in the MPs mixture compared to PET alone. CRE strains colonizing MPs included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Klebsiella quasipneumoniae (n = 3), Raoultella ornithinolytica (n = 2), Enterobacter kobei (n = 1) and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), most (n = 8) recovered after the WWTP discharge. All strains exhibited at least one of the tested virulence traits (biofilm formation at 37 °C, haemolytic activity and siderophore production), were multi-drug resistant and carried carbapenemase-encoding genes [bla(KPC-3) (n = 5), bla(GES-5) (n = 2) or bla(KPC-3) + bla(GES-5) (n = 3)]. Uncommon phenotypes of resistance to imipenem/relebactam (n = 3) and ceftazidime/avibactam (n = 2) were observed. Two bla(KPC−3)-positive K. pneumoniae successfully transfer this gene trough conjugation. Genome analysis predicted all strains as human pathogens. The bla(KPC−3) was associated with the Tn4401d transposon on a pBK30683-like plasmid in most of the isolates (n = 7). The bla(GES-5) was mostly linked to class 3 integrons. A K. pneumoniae strain belonging to the outbreak-causing high-risk clone ST15 carried both bla(KPC-3) and bla(CTX-M-15). Two K. quasipneumoniae isolates carried the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-9. Our results underscore the role of MPs as vectors for CRE dissemination, particularly following WWTPs discharges. MPs may act as carriers, facilitating the dissemination of carbapenemase-encoding genes and potentially contributing to increased CRE incidence in the environment.","Silva I., Tacão M., Henriques I.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171268,Science Of The Total Environment
Temporal Dynamics Of Antibiotic Resistome In The Plastisphere During Microbial Colonization,"The increasing and simultaneous pollution of plastic debris and antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments makes plastisphere a great health concern. However, the development process of antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere is largely unknown, impeding risk assessment associated with plastics. Here, we profiled the temporal dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and microbial composition in the plastisphere from initial microbial colonization to biofilm formation in urban water. A total of 82 ARGs, 12 MGEs, and 63 bacterial pathogens were detected in the plastisphere and categorized as the pioneering, intermediate, and persistent ones. The high number of five MGEs and six ARGs persistently detected in the whole microbial colonization process was regarded as a major concern because of their potential role in disseminating antibiotic resistance. In addition to genomic analysis, D2O-labeled single-cell Raman spectroscopy was employed to interrogate the ecophysiology of plastisphere in a culture-independent way and demonstrated that the plastisphere was inherently more tolerant to antibiotics than bacterioplankton. Finally, by combining persistent MGEs, intensified colonization of pathogenic bacteria, increased tolerance to antibiotic, and potential trophic transfer into a holistic risk analysis, the plastisphere was indicated to constitute a hot spot to acquire and spread antibiotic resistance and impose a long-term risk to ecosystems and human health. These findings provide important insights into the antibiotic resistome and ecological risk of the plastisphere and highlight the necessity for comprehensive surveillance of plastisphere.","Yang K., Chen Q.-L., Chen M.-L., Li H.-Z., Liao H., Pu Q., Zhu Y.-G., Cui L.",10.1021/acs.est.0c04292,Environmental Science And Technology
"An Overview Of The Occurrence, Impact Of Process Parameters, And The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Anaerobic Digestion Processes","Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have emerged as a significant global health threat, contributing to fatalities worldwide. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and livestock farms serve as primary reservoirs for these genes due to the limited efficacy of existing treatment methods and microbial adaptation to environmental stressors. Anaerobic digestion (AD) stands as a prevalent biological treatment for managing sewage sludge and manure in these settings. Given the agricultural utility of AD digestate as biofertilizers, understanding ARGs' fate within AD processes is essential to devise effective mitigation strategies. However, understanding the impact of various factors on ARGs occurrence, dissemination, and fate remains limited. This review article explores various AD treatment parameters and correlates to various resistance mechanisms and hotspots of ARGs in the environment. It further evaluates the dissemination and occurrence of ARGs in AD feedstocks and provides a comprehensive understanding of the fate of ARGs in AD systems. This review explores the influence of key AD parameters such as feedstock properties, pretreatments, additives, and operational strategies on ARGs. Results show that properties such as high solid content and optimum co-digestion ratios can enhance ARG removal, while the presence of heavy metals, microplastics, and antibiotics could elevate ARG abundance. Also, operational enhancements, such as employing two-stage digestion, have shown promise in improving ARG removal. However, certain pretreatment methods, like thermal hydrolysis, may exhibit a rebounding effect on ARG levels. Overall, this review systematically addresses current challenges and offers future perspectives associated with the fate of ARGs in AD systems.","Pourrostami Niavol K., Bordoloi A., Suri R.",10.1007/s11356-024-33844-3,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
"Characterisation And Sequencing Of The Novel Phage Abp95, Which Is Effective Against Multi-Genotypes Of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii","Acinetobacter baumannii has become one of the most challenging conditional pathogens in health facilities. It causes various infectious diseases in humans, such as wound or urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Phage therapy has been used as an alternative strategy for antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii infections and has been approved by several governments. Previously, we have reported two potential phage therapy candidates, Abp1 and Abp9, both of which are narrow-host-range phages. In the present study, we screened and isolated 22 A. baumannii bacteriophages from hospital sewage water and determined that Abp95 has a wide host range (29%; 58/200). The biological and genomic characteristics and anti-infection potential of Abp95 were also investigated. Abp95 belongs to the Myoviridae family, with a G+C content of 37.85% and a genome size of 43,176 bp. Its genome encodes 77 putative genes, none of which are virulence, lysogeny, or antibiotic resistance genes. Abp95 was found to accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse wound infection model by clearing local infections of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. In conclusion, the lytic phage Abp95, which has a wide host range, demonstrates potential as a candidate for phage therapy against multiple sequence types of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.","Huang L., Huang S., Jiang L., Tan J., Yan X., Gou C., Chen X., Xiang L., Wang D., Huang G., Zhang Y., Deng C.",10.1038/s41598-022-26696-9,Scientific Reports
Antibiotic Resistance In Urban Soils: Dynamics And Mitigation Strategies,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a critical global health issue with significant clinical and economic implications. AR occurs when microorganisms develop mechanisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the risk of mortality and healthcare costs. While the connection between antibiotic use in clinical and agricultural settings and the emergence of AR is well-established, the role of urban soils as reservoirs and spreaders of AR is underexplored. This review examines the complex dynamics of AR in urban soils, highlighting the various sources of antibiotics, including domestic wastewater, industrial effluents, urban agricultural practices, but also microplastics and domestic animal excrements. The selective pressure exerted by these anthropogenic sources promotes the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly through horizontal gene transfer, which facilitates the transmission of resistance genes among soil microorganisms in urban environments. About that, the presence of antibiotics in urban soils poses a significant threat to public health by potentially transferring resistance genes to human pathogens through multiple pathways, including direct contact, food consumption, and water ingestion. Furthermore, AR in urban soils disrupts microbial community dynamics, impacting soil fertility, plant growth, and overall environmental quality. Therefore, this review aims to address gaps in understanding AR in urban soils, offering insights into its implications for human health and ecosystem integrity. By identifying these gaps and suggesting evidence-based strategies, this review proposes valid and sustainable solutions to mitigate and counteract the spread of AR in urban environments.","Gentile A., Di Stasio L., Oliva G., Vigliotta G., Cicatelli A., Guarino F., Nissim W.G., Labra M., Castiglione S.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120120,Environmental Research
Fates Of Extracellular And Intracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Activated Sludge And Plastisphere Under Sulfadiazine Pressure,"Microplastics, antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) represent prominent emerging contaminants that can potentially hinder the efficacy of biological wastewater treatment and pose health risks. Plastisphere as a distinct ecological niche for microorganisms, acts as a repository for ARGs and potential pathogenic bacteria. Nonetheless, the spread pattern of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and intracellular ARGs (iARGs) in plastisphere under antibiotic exposure was not yet known. This study aimed to investigate disparities in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, extracellular and intracellular microbial community structures, as well as the transmission of eARGs and iARGs between activated sludge and plastisphere in an anaerobic/anoxic/oxic system under sulfadiazine (SDZ) exposure. SDZ was found to enhance EPS production in activated sludge and plastisphere. Interestingly, as SDZ removal efficiency increased, EPS content decreased in activated sludge and plastisphere collected from oxic zone, and continued to increase in plastisphere samples collected from anaerobic and anoxic zones. There were significant differences in microbial community structure between activated sludge and plastisphere, and the DNA fragments of potential pathogenic bacteria were detected in extracellular samples. SDZ exhibited a promoting effect on the propagation of eARGs, which were more abundant in the plastisphere than in activated sludge, thus heightening the risk of ARGs dissemination. Extracellular mobile genetic elements played a pivotal role in driving the spread of eARGs, while the microbial community induced the changes of iARGs. Potential pathogenic bacteria emerged as potential hosts for ARGs and mobile genetic elements within activated sludge and plastisphere, leading to more serious environmental threats.","Wang Z., Gao J., Zhao Y., Guo Y., Zhang Y., Yuan Y., Zhao M., Zeng L.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120752,Water Research
The Dangerous Transporters: A Study Of Microplastic-Associated Bacteria Passing Through Municipal Wastewater Treatment,"Microplastics (MPs) provide a stable and protective habitat for diverse wastewater bacteria, including pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant species. Therefore, MPs may potentially transport these bacteria through wastewater treatment steps to the environment and far distances. This study investigated bacterial communities of MP-associated bacteria from different stages of municipal wastewater treatment processes to evaluate the potential negative effect of these biofilms on the environment. The results showed a high diversity of bacteria that were strongly attached to MPs. After all treatment steps, the core bacterial groups remained attached to MPs and escaped from the wastewater treatment plant with effluent water. Several pathogenic bacteria were identified in MP samples from all treatment steps, and most of them were found in effluent water.

Soil Plastispheres As Hotpots Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potential Pathogens,"In the Anthropocene, increasing pervasive plastic pollution is creating a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere. How the plastisphere affects microbial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is an issue of global concern. Although this has been studied in aquatic ecosystems, our understanding of plastisphere microbiota in soil ecosystems remains poor. Here, we investigated plastisphere microbiota and ARGs of four types of microplastics (MPs) from diverse soil environments, and revealed effects of manure, temperature, and moisture on them. Our results showed that the MPs select for microbial communities in the plastisphere, and that these plastisphere communities are involved in diverse metabolic pathways, indicating that they could drive diverse ecological processes in the soil ecosystem. The relationship within plastisphere bacterial zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) was predominantly positive, and neutral processes appeared to dominate community assembly. However, deterministic processes were more important in explaining the variance in ARGs in plastispheres. A range of potential pathogens and ARGs were detected in the plastisphere, which were enriched compared to the soil but varied across MPs and soil types. We further found that the addition of manure and elevation of soil temperature and moisture all enhance ARGs in plastispheres, and potential pathogens increase with soil moisture. These results suggested that plastispheres are habitats in which an increased potential pathogen abundance is spatially co-located with an increased abundance of ARGs under global change. Our findings provided new insights into the community ecology of the microbiome and antibiotic resistome of the soil plastisphere.","Zhu D., Ma J., Li G., Rillig M.C., Zhu Y.-G.",10.1038/s41396-021-01103-9,The Isme Journal
Plastisphere Showing Unique Microbiome And Resistome Different From Activated Sludge,"Plastisphere (the biofilm on microplastics) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may enrich pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which can cause risks to the ecological environment by discharging into receiving waters. However, the microbiome and resistome of plastisphere in activated sludge (AS) systems remain inconclusive. Here, metagenome was applied to investigate the microbial composition, functions and ARGs of the Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastisphere in lab-scale reactors, and revealed the effects of tetracycline (TC) and/or Cu(II) pressures on them. The results indicated that the plastisphere provided a new niche for microbiota showing unique functions distinct from the AS. Particularly, various potentially pathogenic bacteria tended to enrich in PVC plastisphere. Moreover, various ARGs were detected in plastisphere and AS, but the plastisphere had more potential ARGs hosts and a stronger correlation with ARGs. The ARGs abundances increased after exposure to TC and/or Cu(II) pressures, especially tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs), and the results further showed that TRGs with different resistance mechanisms were separately enriched in plastisphere and AS. Furthermore, the exogenous pressures from Cu(II) or/and TC also enhanced the association of potential pathogens with TRGs in PVC plastisphere.

However, the effects of different types of MPs on the environmental dynamics of ARGs within these ecosystems remain poorly understood. This study focused on the distribution and composition of ARGs associated with two primary types of MPs—polyethylene and polypropylene—within the Poyang Lake wetland, the largest freshwater lake in China, utilizing metagenomic analysis. The findings demonstrated that the bacterial communities and ARG profiles in the plastisphere were markedly distinct from those in the surrounding water. Specifically, thirteen opportunistic pathogens and forty subtypes of ARGs, primarily related to multidrug, bacitracin, and β-lactam resistance, were identified in the plastisphere. Notably, polyethylene exhibited four times more specific ARG subtypes than polypropylene. Procrustes analysis combined with network analysis indicated a lack of strong correlation between ARG abundance and bacterial populations, suggesting potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within the microbiota of the plastisphere. Additionally, three novel and functional β-lactamase genes were identified within this environment. This investigation highlights the role of MPs as reservoirs for ARGs, facilitating their exchange and posing risks to both ecological integrity and human health, thereby underscoring the need for increased attention in future research efforts.","Liu S., Cao J., Yu J., Jian M., Zou L.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123359,Journal Of Environmental Management
Co-Selection Of Multi-Antibiotic Resistance In Bacterial Pathogens In Metal And Microplastic Contaminated Environments: An Emerging Health Threat,"Misuse/over use of antibiotics increases the threats to human health since this is a main reason behind evolution of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. However, metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, copper and cadmium are accumulating to critical concentration in the environment and triggering co-selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The co-selection of metal driven antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved through co-resistance or cross resistance. Metal driven antibiotic resistant determinants evolved in bacteria and present on same mobile genetic elements are horizontally transferred to distantly related bacterial human pathogens. Additionally, in marine environment persistent pollutants like microplastics is recognized as a vector for the proliferation of metal/antibiotics and human pathogens. Recently published research confirmed that horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distinct microbes present on microplastics is much faster than free living microbes. Therefore, microplastics act as an emerging hotspot for metal driven co-selection of multidrug resistant human pathogens and pose serious threat to humans which do recreational activities in marine environment and ingest marine derived foods. Therefore, marine environment co-polluted with metal, antibiotics, human pathogens and microplastics pose an emerging health threat globally.","Imran M., Das K.R., Naik M.M.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.114,Chemosphere
Tracking Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic-Contaminated Soil,"Agricultural soils and microplastics (MPs) are hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Plastic mulch is the most important source of MPs in agricultural soil. ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and their host profiles in long-term mulch MP-exposed soils remain unclear. In the present study, metagenomics was used to investigate the distribution patterns of ARGs and MGEs in eight Chinese provinces with a long history of plastic mulch use. A total of 204 subtypes of ARGs and thousands of MGEs (14 integrons, 28 insertions, and 2993 plasmids) were identified. A similar diversity of ARGs was found among MPs film-contaminated sites. The types of ARGs with a high abundance were more concentrated, and multidrug resistance genes were the dominant ARGs. Soils from regions with a longer history of plastic film use (such as Xinjiang province) had a higher abundance of ARGs and MGEs. The distribution of ARGs and MGEs exhibited a modular network distribution pattern. A total of 27 ARG subtypes and 29 MGEs showed co-occurrence network relationships. More than 10 common hosts of ARGs and MGEs, such as Pseudomonas, were found, and their abundances were highest in three provinces, including Xinjiang. This study may help elucidate the impact mechanism of long-term MP residues on the occurrence and spread of ARGs in soil.","Wu C., Song X., Wang D., Ma Y., Ren X., Hu H., Shan Y., Ma X., Cui J., Ma Y.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137235,Chemosphere
Ready-To-Eat Dairy Products As A Source Of Multidrug-Resistant Enterococcus Strains: Phenotypic And Genotypic Characteristics,"The enterococci are ubiquitous bacteria able to colonize the human and animal gastrointestinal tracts and fresh and fermented food products. Their highly plastic genome allows Enterococcus spp. to gain resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections with these organisms difficult to treat. Food-borne enterococci could be carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants. The goal of this work was to study the characteristics of Enterococcus spp. in fermented milk products from Poland and their antibiotic resistance gene profiles. A total of 189 strains were isolated from 182 dairy products out of 320 samples tested. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (53.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (34.4%). Isolates were resistant to streptomycin (29.1%), erythromycin (14.3%), tetracycline (11.6%), rifampicin (8.7%), and tigecycline (8.1%). We also detected 2 vancomycin-resistant and 3 linezolid-resistant strains; however, no vanA or vanB genes were identified. A total of 57 high-level aminoglycoside resistance strains (30.2%) were identified, most of which have the ant(6')-Ia gene, followed by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia and aph(3″)-IIIa genes. Resistance to tetracycline was most often conferred by tetM and tetL genes. Macrolide resistance was most frequently encoded by ermB and ermA genes. Conjugative mobile genetic element (transposon Tn916-Tn1545) was identified in 15.3% of the strains, including 96.3% of strains harboring the tetM gene. This study found that enterococci are widely present in retail ready-to-eat dairy products in Poland. Many isolated strains are antibiotic resistant and carry transferable resistance genes, which represent a potential source of transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria to humans.","Chajęcka-Wierzchowska W., Zadernowska A., García-Solache M.",10.3168/jds.2019-17395,Journal Of Dairy Science
Assessing Microplastics-Antibiotics Coexistence Induced Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa At A Water Region Scale,"Microplastics (MPs) waste is widespread globally in water systems. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause serious acute and chronic infections that are notoriously difficult to treat. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is broadly applied as an anti-P. aeruginosa drug. A growing evidence reveals that antibiotic-resistance genes-carrying Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected on MPs forming plastisphere due to their adsorbability along with high occurrence of CIP in water environments. The MPs-niched CIP-resistant P. aeruginosa has been likely to emerge as an unignorable public health issue. Here, we offered a novel approach to assess the development of CIP-resistant P. aeruginosa under MPs-antibiotic coexistence at a water region scale. By combing the adsorption isotherm models used to estimate CIP condensation around MPs and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-based microbial population dynamic model, we predicted the P. aeruginosa development on CIP-adsorbed MPs in waters. Our assessment revealed a high antibiotic resistance in the P. aeruginosa populations (∼50 %) with a wider range of waterborne total cell counts (∼10(−2)–10(4) cfu mL(−1)) among water regions in that the resistance proportion was primarily determined by CIP pollution level and relative abundance of various polymer type of MPs. We implicate that water region-specific MPs were highly likely to provide media for P. aeruginosa propagation. Our results highlight the importance of antibiotic-resistant pathogen colonization−emerging environmental medium interactions when addressing global threat from MPs pollution, in the context of MPs-antibiotics co-contamination assessment and for the continued provision of water system management.","Wang W.-M., Lu T.-H., Chen C.-Y., Liao C.-M.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121721,Water Research
Microplastics Pollution In The Ocean: Potential Carrier Of Resistant Bacteria And Resistance Genes,"Microplastics pollution in marine environments is concerning. Microplastics persist and accumulate in various sections of the ocean where they present opportunity for micropollutant accumulation and microbial colonisation. Even though biofilm formation on plastics was first reported in the 1970's, it is only in recent years were plastic associated biofilms have gained research attention. Plastic surfaces pose a problem as they are a niche ready for colonisation by diverse biofilm assemblages, composed of specific bacterial communities and putative pathogens prone to acquiring ARGs and resistance in the biofilm. However, the nature of antibiotic resistance on aquatic plastic debris is not yet fully understood and remains a concern. Given the inevitable increase of plastic production and waste generation, microplastics released into the environment may prove to be problematic. This review explores microplastic waste in the ocean and possible concerns that may arise from the presence of microplastics in conjunction with favourable conditions for the development and dispersal of antibiotic resistance in the ocean and food web.","Stenger K.S., Wikmark O.G., Bezuidenhout C.C., Molale-Tom L.G.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118130,Environmental Pollution
Urbanization And Waterborne Pathogen Emergence In Low-Income Countries: Where And How To Conduct Surveys?,"A major forthcoming sanitary issue concerns the apparition and spreading of drug-resistant microorganisms, potentially threatening millions of humans. In low-income countries, polluted urban runoff and open sewage channels are major sources of microbes. These microbes join natural microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems already impacted by various chemicals, including antibiotics. These composite microbial communities must adapt to survive in such hostile conditions, sometimes promoting the selection of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains by gene transfer. The low probability of exchanges between planktonic microorganisms within the water column may be significantly improved if their contact was facilitated by particular meeting places. This could be specifically the case within biofilms that develop on the surface of the myriads of floating macroplastics increasingly polluting urban tropical surface waters. Moreover, as uncultivable bacterial strains could be involved, analyses of the microbial communities in their whole have to be performed. This means that new-omic technologies must be routinely implemented in low-and middle-income countries to detect the appearance of resistance genes in microbial ecosystems, especially when considering the new ‘plastic context.’ We summarize the related current knowledge in this short review paper to anticipate new strategies for monitoring and surveying microbial communities.","Bastaraud A., Cecchi P., Handschumacher P., Altmann M., Jambou R.",10.3390/ijerph17020480,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factors In The Plastisphere In Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluent: Health Risk Quantification And Driving Mechanism Interpretation,"Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and provide a unique niche for the spread of pollutants. To date, risk assessments and driving mechanisms of pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and virulence factors (VFs) in the plastisphere are still lacking. Here, the microbiota, ARGs, VFs, their potential health risks, and biologically driving mechanisms on polythene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) and polylactic acid blends (PBAT/PLA), PLA MPs, and gravel in WWTP effluent were investigated. The results showed that plastisphere and gravel biofilm harbored more distinctive microorganisms, promoting the uniqueness of pathogens, ARGs, and VFs compared to WWTP effluent. The abundance of major pathogens, ARGs, and VFs in the plastisphere was 1.01–1.35 times higher than that in the effluent. The high health risk of ARGs (HRA) calculated by fully considering the abundance, clinical relevance, pathogenicity, accessibility and mobility, and the high proportion of resistance contigs with mobile genetic elements confirmed that the plastisphere posed the highest potential health risk. Candidatus Microthrix and Candidatus Promineifilum were the essential hosts of ARGs and VFs in the plastisphere and gravel biofilm, respectively. High metabolic activity such as amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and highly expressed key genes increased the synthesis of ARGs and VFs. The primary mechanisms driving ARG enrichment in the plastisphere were enhanced microbial metabolic activity, increased frequency of horizontal gene transfer, heightened antibiotic inactivation and efflux, and reduced cell permeability. This study provided new insights into the ARGs, VFs, and health risks of the plastisphere and emphasized the importance of strict control of wastewater discharge.","Wang Y., Liu X., Huang C., Han W., Gu P., Jing R., Yang Q.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122896,Water Research
Early And Differential Bacterial Colonization On Microplastics Deployed Into The Effluents Of Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Microbial colonization of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems is a well-known phenomenon; however, there is insufficient knowledge of the early colonization phase. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been proposed as important pathways for MPs entry and transport in aquatic environments and are hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study aimed at characterizing bacterial communities in the early stage of biofilm formation on seven different types of MPs deployed in two different WWTPs effluents as well as measuring the relative abundance of two ARGs (sulI and tetM) on the tested MPs. Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA showed significant higher diversity of bacteria on MPs in comparison with free-living bacteria in the WWTP effluents. β-diversity analysis showed that the in situ environment (sampling site) and hydrophobicity, to a lesser extent, had a role in the early bacterial colonization phase. An early colonization phase MPs-core microbiome could be identified. Furthermore, specific core microbiomes for each type of polymer suggested that each type might select early attachment of bacteria. Although the tested WWTP effluent waters contained antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) harboring the sulI and tetM ARGs, MPs concentrated ARBs harboring the sulI gene but not tetM. These results highlight the relevance of the early attachment phase in the development of bacterial biofilms on different types of MP polymers and the role that different types of polymers might have facilitating the attachment of specific bacteria, some of which might carry ARGs.","Martínez-Campos S., González-Pleiter M., Fernández-Piñas F., Rosal R., Leganés F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143832,Science Of The Total Environment

Size-Dependent Promotion Of Micro(Nano)Plastics On The Horizontal Gene Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Constructed Wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been identified as significant sources of micro(nano)plastics (MPs/NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. However, little is known about the impact of MPs/NPs exposure on horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs and shaping the corresponding ARG hosts’ community. Herein, the contribution of polystyrene (PS) particles (control, 4 mm, 100 μm, and 100 nm) to ARG transfer was investigated by adding an engineered fluorescent Escherichia coli harboring RP4 plasmid-encoded ARGs into CWs. It was found MPs/NPs significantly promoted ARG transfer in a size-dependent manner in each CW medium (p < 0.05). The 100 μm-sized PS exhibited the most significant promotion of ARG transfer (p < 0.05), whereas 100 nm-sized PS induced limited promotion due to its inhibitory activity on microbes. The altered RP4-carrying bacterial communities suggested that MPs/NPs, especially 100 µm-PS, could recruit pathogenic and nitrifying bacteria to acquire ARGs. The increased sharing of RP4-carrying core bacteria in CW medium further suggested that ARGs can spread into CW microbiome using MPs/NPs as carriers. Overall, our results highlight the high risks of ARG dissemination induced by MPs/NPs exposure and emphasize the need for better control of plastic disposal to prevent the potential health threats.","Zhao Y., Hu Z., Xie H., Wu H., Wang Y., Xu H., Liang S., Zhang J.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120520,Water Research
Hydrogels Containing Chitosan-Modified Gold Nanoparticles Show Significant Efficacy In Healing Diabetic Wounds Infected With Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,"Purpose: Persistent Infections and inflammation are associated with impaired wound healing in diabetic patients. There is a pressing demand for innovative antimicrobial strategies to address infections arising from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Polymer-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) show broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and significant biocompatibility. This study investigated the antibacterial and wound healing efficacy of hydrogel dressings conjugated with chitosan-AuNPs in diabetic model rats. Methods: Chitosan (CS)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (CS-AuNPs) were incorporated into hydrogel dressings (Gel/CS-AuNPs), which were formulated through the chemical cross-linking of gelatin with sodium alginate (SA). The basic characteristics of Gel/CS-AuNPs were analyzed by TEM, SEM, XRD, and UV-visible spectra. Rheological, swelling, degradation, and adhesive properties of Gel/CS-AuNPs were also determined. In vitro anti-bactericidal effects of the Gel/CS-AuNPs were analyzed with E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA. In vitro biocompatibility of the Gel/CS-AuNPs was evaluated using NIH3T3 cells. The in vivo antibacterial and wound healing efficacy of the Gel/CS-AuNPs was analyzed in the diabetic wound model rats. Histological and immunofluorescence staining were performed to determine the status of angiogenesis, epithelization, inflammation response, and collagen deposition. Results: Gel/CS-AuNPs demonstrated significant high biodegradability, water absorption bactericidal, and biocompatibility, and slight adhesiveness. Gel/CS-AuNPs exhibited pronounced antibacterial efficacy against gram-negative, gram-positive, and MRSA in a CS-AuNPs-dose-dependent manner. In the diabetic wound model rats, Gel/CS-AuNPs effectively killed MRSA, reduced inflammation, and promoted angiogenesis and collagen deposition and remodeling at the wound site. As a result, Gel/CS-AuNPs expedited the recovery process for infected diabetic wounds. Among the hydrogels with different CS-AuNPs concentrations, Gel/CS-Au(25) with 25% CS-AuNPs showed the best bactericidal and wound healing performance. Conclusion: Gel/CS-AuNPs significantly improve the healing of MRSA-infected diabetic wounds in the rat model. Therefore, Gel/ CS-AuNPs show great promise for the treatment of diabetic infection wound healing.","Meng H., Zhao Y., Cai H., You D., Wang Y., Wu S., Wang Y., Guo W., Qu W.",10.2147/IJN.S448282,International Journal Of Nanomedicine
Plastic Leachate Exposure Drives Antibiotic Resistance And Virulence In Marine Bacterial Communities,"Plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. Plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. However, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. It is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. Here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and AMR within a seawater microcosm community. We show that PVC leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in AMR and virulence genes. In particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches AMR genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. Additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. This study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health.","Vlaanderen E.J., Ghaly T.M., Moore L.R., Focardi A., Paulsen I.T., Tetu S.G.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121558,Environmental Pollution
Antibiotic Resistomes In Face-Mask Biofilm Along An Urban River: Multiple Drivers And Co-Occurrence With Human Opportunistic Pathogens,"Discarded face masks from the global COVID-19 pandemic have contributed significantly to plastic pollution in surface water, whereas their potential as a reservoir for aquatic pollutants is not well understood. Herein, we conducted a field experiment along a human-impacted urban river, investigating the variations of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), pathogens, and water-borne contaminants in commonly-used face masks. Results showed that high-biomass biofilms formed on face masks selectively enriched more ARGs than stone biofilm (0.08–0.22 vs 0.07–0.15 copies/16 S rRNA gene copies) from bulk water, which mainly due to unique microbial communities, enhanced horizontal gene transfer, and selective pressure of accumulated contaminants based on redundancy analysis and variation partitioning analysis. Several human opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Acinetobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacillus, and Klebsiella), which are considered potential ARG carriers, were also greatly concentrated in face-mask biofilms, imposing a potential threat to aquatic ecological environment and human health. Moreover, wastewater treatment plant effluents, as an important source of pollutants to urban rivers, further aggravated the abundances of ARGs and opportunistic pathogens in face-mask biofilms. Our findings demonstrated that discarded face masks provide a hotspot for the proliferation and spread of ARGs and pathogens in urban water, highlighting the urgent requirement for implementing stricter regulations in face mask disposal.","Liu Y.-J., Li Z.-H., He Y.-T., Yuan L., Sheng G.-P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131587,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
How Micro-/Nano-Plastics Influence The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes - A Review,"Plastic debris such as microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPTs), along with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), are pervasive in the environment and are recognized as significant global health and ecological concerns. Micro-/nano-plastics (MNPs) have been demonstrated to favor the spread of ARGs by enhancing the frequency of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through various pathways. This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the current study with focus on the influence of plastics on the HGT of ARGs. The critical role of MNPs in the HGT of ARGs has been well illustrated in sewage sludge, livestock farms, constructed wetlands and landfill leachate. A summary of the performed HGT assay and the underlying mechanism of plastic-mediated transfer of ARGs is presented in the paper. MNPs could facilitate or inhibit HGT of ARGs, and their effects depend on the type, size, and concentration. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the effects of MNPs on the HGT of ARGs, and offers suggestions for further study. Further research should attempt to develop a standard HGT assay and focus on investigating the impact of different plastics, including the oligomers they released, under real environmental conditions on the HGT of ARGs.","Wang X., Li J., Pan X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173881,Science Of The Total Environment
Time-Course Biofilm Formation And Presence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Everyday Plastic Items Deployed In River Waters,"The plastisphere has been widely studied in the oceans; however, there is little information on how living organisms interact with the plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems, and particularly on how this interaction changes over time. We have characterized, over one year, the evolution of the eukaryotic and bacterial communities colonizing four everyday plastic items deployed in two sites of the same river with different anthropogenic impact. α-diversity analyses showed that site had a significant role in bacterial and eukaryotic diversity, with the most impacted site having higher values of the Shannon diversity index. β-diversity analyses showed that site explained most of the sample variation followed by substrate type (i.e., plastic item) and time since first colonization. In this regard, core microbiomes/biomes in each plastic at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months could be identified at genus level, giving a global overview of the evolution of the plastisphere over time. The measured concentration of antibiotics in the river water positively correlated with the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on the plastics. These results provide relevant information on the temporal dynamics of the plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems and emphasize the potential contribution of plastic items to the global spread of antibiotic resistance.","Martínez-Campos S., González-Pleiter M., Rico A., Schell T., Vighi M., Fernández-Piñas F., Rosal R., Leganés F.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130271,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Investigation Of The Effect Of Microplastics On The Uv Inactivation Of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria In Water,"This study investigated the effect of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics on the UV fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug-resistant E. coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at pH 6.0 ± 0.1. In the absence of microplastics, the UV inactivation of the studied bacteria exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation of free (dispersed) bacteria, while in the presence of microplastics, these 2 regimes were followed by an additional regime of slower or no inactivation related to microplastic-associated bacteria (i.e., bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from UV indicated by tailing at higher UV fluences). The magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics varied with different microplastics (type/particle size) and bacteria (Gram-negative and Gram-positive). Results showed that when the UV transmittance of the microplastic-containing water was not taken into account in calculating UV fluences, the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated. A UV fluence-based double-exponential microbial inactivation model accounting for both free and microplastic-associated bacteria could describe well the disinfection data. The present study elucidated the effect of microplastics on the performance of UV disinfection, and the approach used herein to prove this concept may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of other particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfection processes in different water and wastewater matrices.","Manoli K., Naziri A., Ttofi I., Michael C., Allan I.J., Fatta-Kassinos D.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118906,Water Research
Long-Term Application Of Organic Fertilizer Prompting The Dispersal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Their Health Risks In The Soil Plastisphere,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is a rapidly growing global environmental concern that has led to the emergence of a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere, which is a hotspot for the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs). However, studies on the effects of long-term organic fertilizer application on the dispersal of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the plastisphere of farmland soil have been limited. Here, we performed a field culture experiment by burying nylon bags filled with MPs in paddy soil that had been treated with different fertilizers for over 30 years to explore the changes of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastisphere. Our results show that the soil plastisphere amplified the ARG and VFG pollution caused by organic fertilization by 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively. And it also led to a 2.7-fold increase in the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Meanwhile, the plastisphere tended to promote deterministic process in the community assembly of HBPs, with an increase of 1.4 times. Network analysis found a significant correlation between ARGs, VFGs, and bacteria in plastisphere. Correlation analysis highlight the important role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in shaping the abundance of ARGs and VFGs, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the health risk associated with the soil plastisphere due ARGs and VFGs derived from organic fertilizers.","Lin D., Xu J.-Y., Wang L., Du S., Zhu D.",10.1016/j.envint.2024.108431,Environment International
Horizontal Gene Transfer Via Omvs Co-Carrying Virulence And Antimicrobial-Resistant Genes Is A Novel Way For The Dissemination Of Carbapenem-Resistant Hypervirulent Klebsiella Pneumoniae,"Introduction: The rapidly increased isolation rate of CR-HvKP worldwide has brought great difficulties in controlling clinical infection. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the transmission of drug-resistant genes among bacteria can be mediated by outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which is a new way of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The transmission of virulence genes among bacteria has also been well studied; however, it remains unclear whether virulence and drug-resistant genes can be co-transmitted simultaneously. Co-transmission of virulence and drug-resistant genes is essential for the formation and prevalence of CR-HvKP. Methods: First, we isolated OMVs from CR-HvKP by cushioned-density gradient ultracentrifugation (C-DGUC). TEM and DLS were used to examine the morphology and size of bacterial OMVs. OMV-mediated gene transfer in liquid cultures and the acquisition of the carbapenem gene and virulence gene was confirmed using colony-PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, mCIM and eCIM were conducted for the resistance of transformant. Serum killing assay, assessment of the anti-biofilm effect and galleria mellonella infection model, mucoviscosity assay, extraction and quantification of capsules were verified the virulence of transformant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), S1 nuclease-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), Southern blotting hybridization confirmed the plasmid of transformant. Results: Firstly, OMVs were isolated from CR-HvKP NUHL30457 (K2, ST86). TEM and DLS analyses revealed the spherical morphology of the vesicles. Secondly, our study demonstrated that CR-HvKP delivered genetic material, incorporated DNA within the OMVs, and protected it from degradation by extracellular exonucleases. Thirdly, the vesicular lumen DNA was delivered to the recipient cells after determining the presence of virulence and carbapenem-resistant genes in the CR-HvKP OMVs. Importantly, S1-PFGE and Southern hybridization analysis of the 700603 transformant strain showed that the transformant contained both drug-resistant and virulence plasmids. Discussion: In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of CRHvKP-OMVs in transmitting CR-HvKP among K. pneumoniae. Collectively, our findings provided valuable insights into the evolution of CR-HvKP.","Li P., Luo W., Xiang T.-X., Jiang Y., Liu P., Wei D.-D., Fan L., Huang S., Liao W., Liu Y., Zhang W.",10.3389/fmicb.2022.945972,Frontiers In Microbiology
Universal Contact Precautions Do Not Change The Prevalence Of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms In A Tertiary Burn Unit,"Objective The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (ARO) in burn units is increasing worldwide and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Study aims are to describe the burden of AROs in burn patients admitted to a tertiary burn unit, to evaluate the impact of contact precautions implemented after an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and to identify possible predictors of ARO acquisition. Methods Data of burn inpatients between 2006 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of ARO colonization/infection at or after admission were reviewed in detail. Organisms of interest included: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed with the p-value set at 0.05. Results Complete data analysis was available for 340 patients. The mean age was 41.8 years with male predominance. Among the AROs, the most prevalent was MRSA from clinical specimens. Prior to contact precaution implementation, the prevalence of all AROs was 27.9%, compared to 27.6% afterwards. There was an increase in Pseudomonas and VRE isolates and a disappearance of Acinetobacter. The most common isolate sites were the burn wounds. ICU stay, burns >20% TBSA, and surgical management were significant predictors of ARO acquisition. Conclusion This study describes the ARO profile of burn patients admitted to a tertiary burn unit. The results suggest that implementation of unit-wide contact precautions may not significantly reduce the frequency of AROs among burn patients. Contact precautions for patients transferred from the ICU, undergoing surgery, and large burns may be of benefit.","Ho A.L., Chambers R., Malic C., Papp A.",10.1016/j.burns.2016.11.001,Burns
Biodegradable Microplastics Induced The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factors In Soil: A Metagenomic Perspective,"Concerns about the ecological safety of both conventional and biodegradable microplastics have grown due to the inadequate end-of-life treatments of plastics. In this study, the effects of conventional and biodegradable microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) were estimated in a soil microcosm experiment. The gene profiles and their respective bacterial hosts in soil were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing methods. The abundances of ARGs and VFs in polybutylene succinate (PBS) treated soils were statistically higher than the values in the control and conventional microplastic treatments. In comparison with the control, application of conventional microplastics showed negligible effects on ARG and VF profiles in the soil, while biodegradable microplastic amendments significantly changed the compositions of ARGs and VFs. The host-tracking analysis suggested application of microplastics broadened the bacterial hosts of ARGs and VFs in the soil. The percentage of Proteobacteria as ARG hosts increased from 38.5% in the control soils to 58.2% in microplastic exposed soil. The genus Bradyrhizobium was the dominant host of ARGs and VFs in biodegradable microplastic treatments, while conventional microplastics increased the percentages of Pseudomonas as the bacterial hosts. This study enhances the understanding of the effects of conventional and biodegradable microplastics on the propagation and hosts of ARGs and VFs in the terrestrial environment, providing essential insights into the risk assessment and management of plastics.","Song R., Sun Y., Li X., Ding C., Huang Y., Du X., Wang J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154596,Science Of The Total Environment
Are Microplastics In Aquaculture An Undeniable Driver In Accelerating The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes?,"Aquaculture products have been a key source of protein in the human food supply. Contamination by microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) directly affects food quality and safety. Plastic fishing gear and the long-term misuse of antibiotics result in the persistent residue, migration, and spread of microplastics and ARGs in the aquaculture environment, causing in ecological imbalance and endangering human security. Microplastics can act as ""petri dishes"" for the reproduction, communication, and spread of ARGs, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the global issues surrounding microplastics and ARGs. Aquaculture has become an important source of microplastics and ARGs in natural waters. Accordingly, this paper mainly discusses the contribution of aquaculture to the presence of microplastics and ARGs in aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics and ARGs can (1) affect the production and quality of aquatic products; (2) influence the development and reproduction of aquatic organisms; and (3) accelerate the spread of resistant bacteria. How to eliminate microplastics and ARGs and block their transmission has become a worldwide problem. Actually, further research is required to understand the scale and scope of these effects.","Jin R., Zhang J., Zhao Y., Liu S., Shen M.",10.1007/s11356-023-30412-z,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance: The Magnitude Of The Problem And The Emerging Role Of Hospital Wastewater,"The role of microplastics (MPs) in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is increasingly attracting global research attention due to their unique ecological and environmental effects. The ubiquitous use of plastics and their release into the environment by anthropic/industrial activities are the main sources for MP contamination, especially of water bodies. Because of their physical and chemical characteristics, MPs represent an ideal substrate for microbial colonization and formation of biofilm, where horizontal gene transfer is facilitated. In addition, the widespread and often injudicious use of antibiotics in various human activities leads to their release into the environment, mainly through wastewater. For these reasons, wastewater treatment plants, in particular hospital plants, are considered hotspots for the selection of ARGs and their diffusion in the environment. As a result, the interaction of MPs with drug-resistant bacteria and ARGs make them vectors for the transport and spread of ARGs and harmful microorganisms. Microplastic-associated antimicrobial resistance is an emerging threat to the environment and consequently for human health. More studies are required to better understand the interaction of these pollutants with the environment as well as to identify effective management systems to reduce the related risk.","Tuvo B., Scarpaci M., Bracaloni S., Esposito E., Costa A.L., Ioppolo M., Casini B.",10.3390/ijerph20105868,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
Plastisphere Enrich Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potential Pathogenic Bacteria In Sewage With Pharmaceuticals,"Microplastics (MPs) and pharmaceuticals are common emerging pollutants in sewage, and their coexistence may have more negative effects on the environments. This study chose tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP) and triclosan (TCS) to investigate the responses of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities on different MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)) biofilms (plastisphere). The adsorption capacity of three pharmaceuticals on PVC and PE decreased in the order of AMP > TC > TCS. PE was more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. MPs led to the increase of the total copies of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the sewage. Importantly, multidrug ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of TC and MPs led to higher risks of spreading ARGs and MGEs. In addition, potential pathogenic bacteria Legionella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria and Arcobacter were more abundant on plastisphere than those in sewage, and these bacteria might be the hosts for ARGs and MGEs. This study showed that plastisphere could be repositories of ARGs and MGEs in sewage and accumulated potential pathogenic bacteria.","Wang Z., Gao J., Zhao Y., Dai H., Jia J., Zhang D.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144663,Science Of The Total Environment
Pharmacotechnical Aspects Of A Stable Probiotic Formulation Toward Multidrug-Resistance Antibacterial Activity: Design And Quality Control,"As a well-known group of the probiotic family, the Lactobacillus has increasingly contributed to hindering the growth of pathogens, particularly resistant species, in the last decades. Since antibiotic resistance has become a severe problem in global healthcare systems and considerably increased the mortality and morbidity rate in infectious diseases, we aimed to obtain a new stable formulation of Lactobacillus to overcome resistant infections. For this purpose, we designed various gel formulations containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a water base and oil base gel, evaluated the probiotic stability in formulation to obtain an optimum formulation, and finally, investigated the antibacterial activities of that against two common hospital-associated multidrug-resistant pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Furthermore, the pharmaceutical aspects of the optimum formulation, including stability, homogeneity, spreadability, pH value, conductivity, and rheological behavior, were assessed. The results indicated that the optimum formulation based on glycerol exhibited desirable pharmaceutical properties, including long-term stability, a perfect level of homogeneity, an acceptable range of spreadability with pseudo-plastic thixotropic behavior, and a promising antibacterial potential against MRSA and VRE. Our findings indicate that this novel probiotic formulation could be an excellent candidate to cope with antibiotic-resistant species, representing a hopeful treatment potential for topical applications, particularly in incurable infections. However, further in vivo studies seem warranted to evaluate their bactericidal activity against multi-drug resistant microorganisms.","Karimi F., Azadi A., Omidifar N., Najafabady N.M., Mohammadi F., Kazemi R., Gholami A.",10.1186/s12906-023-04224-0,Bmc Complementary Medicine And Therapies
Microplastics Accumulation In Mangroves Increasing The Resistance Of Its Colonization Vibrio And Shewanella,"The enrichment of various pollutants in mangrove has attracted widespread attention. Especially, microplastics accumulation in mangrove may provide a more challenging ecological colonization site by enriching pollutants, thus affecting the change of microplastics antibiotic resistance and increasing the risk of antibiotic failure. Herein, the antibiotic-resistant of microplastics and sediment from mangrove were investigated. The results show that isolates are mainly colonized by Vibrio parahemolyticus (V. parahemolyticus), Vibrio alginolyticus (V. alginolyticus), and Shewanella. 100% mangrove microplastics isolates are resistant to chloramphenicol, cefazolin, and tetracycline, especially amoxicillin clavulanate and ampicillin. Meanwhile, the multiple antibiotics resistance (MAR) indexes of V. parahaemolyticus, Shewanella, and V. alginolyticus in mangrove microplastics are 0.72, 0.77, and 0.77, respectively, which are far higher than the MAR index standard (0.2) and that of mangrove sediment isolates. Furthermore, compared with V. parahaemolyticus isolated from the same mangrove microplastics, Shewanella and V. alginolyticus show stronger drug resistance. It should be noted that there is a closely related relationship between the type of microplastics and the antibiotics resistance of isolated bacteria. For the antibiotics sensitivity test of norfloxacin, streptomycin, amoxicillin, and chloramphenicol, V. parahaemolyticus have the lower antibiotics resistance than that of V. alginolyticus isolated from the same mangrove microplastics. However, Vibrio isolated from PE has stronger antibiotics resistance. Results reveal that mangrove may be one of the potential risks for emergence and spread of bacterial antibiotics-resistant and multidrug-resistant, and microplastic biofilms may act as promoters of bacterial antibiotic resistance.","Tan B., Li Y., Xie H., Dai Z., Zhou C., Qian Z.-J., Hong P., Liang Y., Ren L., Sun S., Li C.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133861,Chemosphere
Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms On Plastic Wastes In An Estuarine Environment,"Plastic wastes are ubiquitous in aquatic environment. Biofilms, which are often formed on the surface of plastic waste, may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs) and their associated microbial communities in biofilms formed on different types of plastic, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples taken from the Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) with visible biofilms were highly abundant, and the average absolute abundance of most tested ARGs in the biofilms was higher than that in the sediment and water, indicating that biofilms on plastics can act as a reservoir for ARGs. Moreover, the biofilms on PE had a higher relative abundance of ARGs, compared to those on other plastics, and Firmicutes on PE may be potential hosts for these ARGs. Furthermore, Bacillus, Mycobacterium and Pseudomonas may be multi-resistance genera on plastics, and tetA and tetW may have more potential hosts on PET and PP. Metals, total phosphorus and salinity may be the major environmental factors regulating ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics. The results provide new insights into evaluating the risks caused by plastic wastes and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics in estuarine environment.","Guo X.-P., Sun X.-L., Chen Y.-R., Hou L., Liu M., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140916,Science Of The Total Environment
"Polyoxometalates And Their Composites For Antimicrobial Applications: Advances, Mechanisms And Future Prospects","The overuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can be even more difficult to treat and pose an even greater threat to public health. In order to address the issue of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, researchers currently are exploring alternative methods of sterilization that are both effective and sustainable. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as emerging transition metal oxide compounds, exhibit significant potential in various applications due to their remarkable tunable physical and chemical performance, especially in antibacterial fields. They constitute a diverse family of inorganic clusters, characterized by a wide array of composition, structures and charges. Presently, several studies indicated that POM-based composites have garnered extensive attention in the realms of the antibacterial field and may become promising materials for future medical applications. Moreover, this review will focus on exploring the antibacterial properties and mechanisms of different kinds of organic-inorganic hybrid POMs, POM-based composites, films and hydrogels with substantial bioactivity, while POM-based composites have the dual advantages of POMs and other materials. Additionally, the potential antimicrobial mechanisms have also been discussed, mainly encompassing cell wall/membrane disruption, intracellular material leakage, heightened intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and depletion of glutathione (GSH). These findings open up exciting possibilities for POMs as exemplary materials in the antibacterial arena and expand their prospective applications.","Ma M., Chen J., Dong L., Su Y., Tian S., Zhou Y., Li M.",10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2024.112739,Journal Of Inorganic Biochemistry
Evidence Of Selective Enrichment Of Bacterial Assemblages And Antibiotic Resistant Genes By Microplastics In Urban Rivers,"The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments has recently drawn considerable attention due to their potential threat to the entire ecosystem. The colonization of bacterial communities on microplastics is an important ecological linkage for microplastics in aquatic ecosystems, which is yet poorly understood. In this study, microplastic particles were sampled in two urbanized rivers in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China, and the differences between bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics and planktonic bacteria were estimated. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial communities on microplastics were less rich and diverse compared to those from the freshwater samples, with a significantly distinct taxonomic composition. The predicted functional profiles also indicated significant differences between microplastic and water samples. The functions related to biofilm formation and human diseases were relatively higher for the bacterial communities on the microplastics. Network analyses suggested that microplastic bacterial communities possessed higher average path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity compared to those in water samples. Additionally, quantitative PCR results showed microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), and a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition was observed. The relative abundances of integron-integrase gene classes 1 and 2 were greater on microplastics, potentially suggesting a higher level of horizontal gene transfer. Findings of this study suggested microplastics are a novel microbial niche and may serve as hotspots for microbial interaction, potentially increasing risks to freshwater ecosystems and human health.","Wang J., Qin X., Guo J., Jia W., Wang Q., Zhang M., Huang Y.",10.1016/j.watres.2020.116113,Water Research
Beach Sand Plastispheres Are Hotspots For Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Potentially Pathogenic Bacteria Even In Beaches With Good Water Quality,"Massive amounts of microplastics are transported daily from the oceans and rivers onto beaches. The ocean plastisphere is a hotspot and a vector for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the plastisphere in beach sand. Thus, to describe whether the microplastics from beach sand represent a risk to human health, we evaluated the bacteriome and abundance of ARGs on microplastic and sand sampled at the drift line and supralittoral zones of four beaches of poor and good water quality. The bacteriome was evaluated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, and the ARGs and bacterial abundances were evaluated by high-throughput real-time PCR. The results revealed that the microplastic harbored a bacterial community that is more abundant and distinct from that of beach sand, as well as a greater abundance of potential human and marine pathogens, especially the microplastics deposited closer to seawater. Microplastics also harbored a greater number and abundance of ARGs. All antibiotic classes evaluated were found in the microplastic samples, but not in the beach sand ones. Additionally, 16 ARGs were found on the microplastic alone, including genes related to multidrug resistance (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, tetM, mdtE and acrB_1), genes that have the potential to rapidly and horizontally spread (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, and tetM), and the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics that are typically regarded as the ultimate line of defense against severe multi-resistant bacterial infections (blaKPC). Lastly, microplastic harbored a similar bacterial community and ARGs regardless of beach water quality. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of microplastics in beach sand worldwide may constitute a potential threat to human health, even in beaches where the water quality is deemed satisfactory. This phenomenon may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs.","Magalhães E.A., De Jesus H.E., Pereira P.H.F., Gomes A.S., Santos H.F.D.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.123237,Environmental Pollution
"Phage Therapy For Bone And Joint Infections: A Comprehensive Exploration Of Challenges, Dynamics, And Therapeutic Prospects","Objectives: Bone and joint infections (BJI) pose formidable challenges in orthopaedics due to antibiotic resistance and the complexities of biofilm, complicating treatment. This comprehensive exploration addresses the intricate challenges posed by BJI and highlights the significant role of phage therapy as a non-antibiotic strategy. Methods: BJI, which encompass prosthetic joint infections, osteomyelitis, and purulent arthritis, are exacerbated by biofilm formation on bone and implant surfaces, hindering treatment efficacy. Gram-negative bacterial infections, characterized by elevated antibiotic resistance, further contribute to the clinical challenge. Amidst this therapeutic challenge, phage therapy emerges as a potential strategy, showing unique characteristics such as strict host specificity and biofilm disruption capabilities. Results: The review unveils the dynamics of phages, including their origins, lifecycle outcomes, and genomic characteristics. Animal studies, in vitro investigations, and clinical research provide compelling evidence of the efficacy of phages in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections, particularly in osteomyelitis cases. Phage lysins exhibit biofilm-disrupting capabilities, offering a meaningful method for addressing BJI. Recent statistical analyses reveal high clinical relief rates and a favourable safety profile for phage therapy. Conclusions: Despite its promise, phage therapy encounters limitations, including a narrow host range and potential immunogenicity. The comprehensive analysis navigates these challenges and charts the future of phage therapy, emphasizing standardization, pharmacokinetics, and global collaboration. Anticipated strides in phage engineering and combination therapy hold promise for combating antibiotic-resistant BJI.","Peng J., Guo C., Yang C., Zhang L., Yang F., Huang X., Yu Y., Zhang T., Peng J.",10.1016/j.jgar.2024.07.007,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
Dynamic Evolution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Plastisphere In The Vertical Profile Of Urban Rivers,"Microplastics (MPs) can vertically transport in the aquatic environment due to their aging and biofouling, forming distinct plastisphere in different water layers. However, even though MPs have been regarded as hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), little is known about the propagation and transfer of ARGs in plastisphere in waters, especially in the vertical profile. Therefore, this study investigated the dynamic responses and evolution of ARGs in different plastisphere distributed vertically in an urbanized river. The biofilm biomass in the polylactic acid (PLA) plastisphere was relatively higher than that in the polyethylene terephthalate (PET), showing depth-decay variations. The ARGs abundance in plastisphere were much higher than that in the surrounding waters, especially for the PLA. In the vertical profiles, the ARGs abundance in the PET plastisphere increased with water depths, while the highest abundance of ARGs in the PLA mostly appeared at intermediate waters. In the temporal dynamic, the ARGs abundance in plastisphere increased and then decreased, which may be dominated by the MP types at the initial periods. After long-term exposure, the influences of water depths seemed to be strengthened, especially in the PET plastisphere. Compared with surface waters, the microbiota attached in plastisphere in deep waters showed high species richness, strong diversity, and complex interactions, which was basically consistent with the changes of nutrient contents in different water layers. These vertical variations in microbiota and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) may be responsible for the propagation of ARGs in plastisphere in deep waters. The host bacteria for ARGs in plastisphere was also developed as water depth increased, leading to an enrichment of ARGs in deep waters. In addition, the abundance of ARGs in plastisphere in bottom waters was positively correlated with the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of intI1 and tnpA05, indicative of a frequent horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. Overall, water depth played a critical role in the propagation of ARGs in plastisphere, which should not be ignored in a long time series. This study provides new insights into the dynamic evolution of ARGs propagation in plastisphere under increasing global MPs pollution, especially in the vertical profile.","Chen Y., Yan Z., Zhou Y., Zhang Y., Jiang R., Wang M., Yuan S., Lu G.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120946,Water Research
A Review On The Effect Of Micro- And Nano-Plastics Pollution On The Emergence Of Antimicrobial Resistance,"The recent upsurge in the studies on micro/nano plastics and antimicrobial resistance genes has proven their deleterious effects on the environmental and human health. Till-date, there is a scarcity of studies on the interactions of these two factors and their combined influence. The interaction of microplastics has led to the formation of new plastics namely plastiglomerates, pyroplastics. and anthropoquinas. It has long been ignored that the occurrence of microplastics has become a breeding ground for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Evidently microplastics are also associated with the occurrence of other pollutants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. The increased use of antibiotics (after Covid breakout) has further elevated the detrimental effects on human health. Therefore, this study highlights the relation of microplastics with antibiotic resistance generation. The factors such as uncontrolled use of antibiotics and negligent plastic consumption has been evaluated. Furthermore, the future research prospective was provided that can be helpful in correctly identifying the seriousness of the environmental occurrence of these pollutants.","Gaur V.K., Sirohi R., Bhat M.I., Gautam K., Sharma P., Srivastava J.K., Pandey A.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136877,Chemosphere
"Characterization Of Microbial Community, Ecological Functions And Antibiotic Resistance In Estuarine Plastisphere","The plastisphere is a new ecological niche. Compared to the surrounding water, microbial community composition associated with the plastisphere is known to differ with functional consequences. Here, this study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities associated with four types of plastisphere (polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) in an estuarine habitat; assessed ecological functions including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, and determined the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human pathogens. Stochastic processes dominated the community assembly of microorganisms on the plastisphere. Several functional genera related to nutrient cycling were enriched in the plastisphere. Compared to surrounding water and other plastisphere, the abundances of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling genes (cdaR, nosZ and chpy etc.) and ARGs (aadA2–1, cfa and catB8 etc.) were significantly increased in polyvinyl chloride plastisphere. In contrast, the polystyrene plastisphere was the preferred substrate for several pathogens being enriched with for example, Giardia lamblia 18S rRNA, Klebsiella pneumoniae phoE and Legionella spp. 23S rRNA. Overall, this study showed that different plastisphere had different effects on ecological functions and health risk in estuaries and emphasizes the importance of controlling plastic pollution in estuaries. Data from this study support global policy drivers that seek to reduce plastic pollution and offer insights into ecological functions in a new ecological niche of the Anthropocene.","Yang L.-Y., Huang X.-R., Neilson R., Zhou S.-Y.-D., Li Z.-L., Yang X.-R., Su X.-X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161322,Science Of The Total Environment
Coatable And Resistance-Proof Ionic Liquid For Pathogen Eradication,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria infect close to 3 million people, and kill 35,000, each year in the United States. Ionic liquid (IL)-based antimicrobial agents have the potential to diversify our ever-diminishing antibiotic arsenal. Here, we describe an IL with potent submicromolar antimicrobial activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens as well as anti-infective activity in a mouse model. The IL kills pathogenic bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli by disrupting their outer membrane and does not select for bacterial resistance. We show incorporation of our IL into surface coatings to generate a type of antibiofilm material. The IL-loaded ionogel surfaces demonstrate high-antimicrobial and antifouling activity by killing bacteria in both static and dynamic tests. Our IL-based antibiofilm surfaces are low-cost and easy to manufacture, can be formed on glass, latex, plastic, and metal surfaces, such as catheters and other medical devices where high local concentrations of antimicrobials are needed, and may have applications in other clinical and industrial settings.","Torres M.D.T., Voskian S., Brown P., Liu A., Lu T.K., Hatton T.A., De La Fuente-Nunez C.",10.1021/acsnano.0c07642,Acs Nano
Application Of Crispr-Cas System In The Diagnosis And Therapy Of Eskape Infections,"Antimicrobial-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens represent a global threat to human health. ESKAPE pathogens are the most common opportunistic pathogens in nosocomial infections, and a considerable number of their clinical isolates are not susceptible to conventional antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, innovative therapeutic strategies that can effectively deal with ESKAPE pathogens will bring huge social and economic benefits and ease the suffering of tens of thousands of patients. Among these strategies, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system has received extra attention due to its high specificity. Regrettably, there is currently no direct CRISPR-system-based anti-infective treatment. This paper reviews the applications of CRISPR-Cas system in the study of ESKAPE pathogens, aiming to provide directions for the research of ideal new drugs and provide a reference for solving a series of problems caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) in the post-antibiotic era.

Shallow Shotgun Sequencing Of Healthcare Waste Reveals Plastic-Eating Bacteria With Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"The burgeoning crises of antimicrobial resistance and plastic pollution are converging in healthcare settings, presenting a complex challenge to global health. This study investigates the microbial populations in healthcare waste to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance and the potential for plastic degradation by bacteria. Our metagenomic analysis, using both amplicon and shallow shotgun sequencing, provided a comprehensive view of the taxonomic diversity and functional capacity of the microbial consortia. The viable bacteria in healthcare waste samples were analyzed employing full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, revealing a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Notably, Proteus mirabilis VFC3/3 and Pseudomonas sp. VFA2/3 were detected, while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VFV3/2 surfaced as the predominant species, holding implications for the spread of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multidrug-resistant strains conferring antimicrobial genes, including the broad-spectrum antibiotic carbapenem, underscoring the critical need for improved waste management and infection control measures. Remarkably, we found genes linked to the breakdown of plastic that encoded for enzymes of the esterase, depolymerase, and oxidoreductase classes. This suggests that specific bacteria found in medical waste may be able to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that comes from biological and medical waste. The information is helpful in formulating strategies to counter the combined problems of environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring microbial communities in hospital waste in order to influence waste management procedures and public health policy.

Virulence Genes Distributed Among Staphylococcus Aureus Causing Wound Infections And Their Correlation To Antibiotic Resistance,"Background: Staphylococcus aureus causes many human infections, including wound infections, and its pathogenicity is mainly influenced by several virulence factors. Aim: This study aimed to detect virulence genes (hla, sea, icaA, and fnbA) in S. aureus isolated from different wound infections among Egyptian patients admitted to Minia University Hospital. This study also aimed to investigate the prevalence of these genes in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates and the resistance and sensitivity to different antibiotic classes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from November 2019 to September 2021. Standard biochemical and microbiological tests revealed 59 S. aureus isolates. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to determine antibiotic susceptibility. DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit, and polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify all genes. Results: A total of 59 S. aureus isolates were detected from 51 wound samples. MRSA isolates accounted for 91.5%, whereas MSSA isolates accounted for 8.5%. The multidrug resistance (MDR) percentage in S. aureus isolates was 54.2%. S. aureus showed high sensitivity pattern against vancomycin, linezolid, and chloramphenicol. However, a high resistance pattern was observed against oxacillin and piperacillin. sea was the most predominant gene (72.9%), followed by icaA (49.2%), hla (37.3%), and fnbA (13.6%). sea was the commonest virulence gene among MRSA isolates (72.2%), and a significant difference in the distribution of icaA was found. However, sea and icaA were the commonest genes among MSSA isolates (79.9%). The highest distribution of sea was found among ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (95.2%). Conclusion: The incidence of infections caused by MDR S. aureus significantly increased with MRSA prevalence. sea is the most predominant virulence factor among antibiotic-resistant strains with a significant correlation to piperacillin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin.","Rasmi A.H., Ahmed E.F., Darwish A.M.A., Gad G.F.M.",10.1186/s12879-022-07624-8,Bmc Infectious Diseases
"Unraveling The Effect Of Micro/Nanoplastics On The Occurrence And Horizontal Transfer Of Environmental Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Advances, Mechanisms And Future Prospects","Microplastics can not only serve as vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but also they and even nanoplastics potentially affect the occurrence of ARGs in indigenous environmental microorganisms, which have aroused great concern for the development of antibiotic resistance. This article specifically reviews the effects of micro/nanoplastics (concentration, size, exposure time, chemical additives) and their interactions with other pollutants on environmental ARGs dissemination. The changes of horizontal genes transfer (HGT, i.e., conjugation, transformation and transduction) of ARGs caused by micro/nanoplastics were also summarized. Further, this review systematically sums up the mechanisms of micro/nanoplastics regulating HGT process of ARGs, including reactive oxygen species production, cell membrane permeability, transfer-related genes expression, extracellular polymeric substances production, and ARG donor-recipient adsorption/contaminants adsorption/biofilm formation. The underlying mechanisms in changes of bacterial communities induced by micro/nanoplastics were also discussed as it was an important factor for structuring the profile of ARGs in the actual environment, including causing environmental stress, providing carbon sources, forming biofilms, affecting pollutants distribution and environmental factors. This review contributes to a systematical understanding of the potential risks of antibiotic resistance dissemination caused by micro/nanoplastics and provokes thinking about perspectives for future research and the management of micro/nanoplastics and plastics.","Shi J., Sun C., An T., Jiang C., Mei S., Lv B.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174466,Science Of The Total Environment
Antibiotic Resistance Genes Proliferation Under Anaerobic Degradation Of Polylactic Acid And Polyhydroxy Butyrate Bioplastics,"As the global concern over plastic pollution grows, efforts are underway to find environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics. Bioplastics are being extensively researched and developed as a possible solution. This study compared the impact of two bioplastics, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB), on the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during anaerobic digestion (AD). Both bioplastics (250–500 particles) could be degraded to a certain extent over 79 days, as indicated by higher methane production than the control without bioplastic particles. The PHB 500 reactor showed the highest methane yield along with the highest biodegradation efficiency (91 %) than other reactors amended with PHB and PLA particles. The highest ARG and MGE abundances were also observed in PLA 500, and the lowest ARG abundance was in PLA 250. Conversely, PHB reactors showed a relatively lower ARG abundance than the control. The correlation analysis suggested that most ARGs were positively correlated with PLA and negatively correlated with PHB (except for tetA, tetB, and tetX). Moreover, a correlation between MGEs and ARGs in PLA and PHB reactors was revealed by correlation analysis. These results show that AD responds differently to the different types/levels of bioplastics, which can ultimately influence the behavior of ARG proliferation. Thus, bioplastics may also pose a potential risk for spreading antibiotic resistance. These findings can be used as a basis for setting environmental standards for bioplastics and creating monitoring and control measures to prevent potential negative impacts on public health.","Haffiez N., Zakaria B.S., Mohammad Mirsoleimani Azizi S., Ranjan Dhar B.",10.1016/j.envint.2023.107938,Environment International
The Effects Of Small Plastic Particles On Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer Revealed By Single Cell And Community Level Analysis,"Small plastic particles with sizes comparable to bacterial cells, widely exist in environment. However, their effects on antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dissemination remain unclear. Using polystyrene (PS) particles (0.2 µm, 2 µm, 5 µm, 10 µm, 15 µm, 20 µm) as models, conjugative transfer of ARGs between the donor E. coli and different recipients (E. coli or sludge bacterial community) was investigated. Compared to the pure strain, the sludge bacterial community exposed to PS particles showed higher transfer frequencies (1.67 to 14.31 times the blank control). The transfer frequencies first decreased and then increased with particle size, and plastics similar in size to bacteria (e.g., 2 µm) appear to be a transitional zone with minimal impact on ARG transmission. Furthermore, using microfluidics, in-situ observation at single cell level found that 2 µm plastics can act as barriers between donor and recipient bacteria inhibiting growth, but conjugation events mostly occurred around them. Conversely, nanoplastics (e.g., 0.2 µm) and larger microplastics (e.g., 20 µm) significantly promote conjugation, mainly due to increased reactive oxygen species production and cell membrane permeability, or facilitating bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, respectively. This study aids in assessing environmental risks of small plastic particles on ARG dissemination.","Luo Y., Xu T., Li B., Liu F., Wu B., Dobson P.S., Yin H., Chen Z., Qiu Y., Huang X.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136271,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Differences In The Plastispheres Of Biodegradable And Non-Biodegradable Plastics: A Mini Review,"There has been a steady rise in the production and disposal of biodegradable plastics. Unlike the microorganisms present in the biofilms on non-biodegradable plastic surfaces (the “plastisphere”), the plastisphere of biodegradable plastic has not been well-characterized. As the polymer structure of biodegradable plastic has a higher microbial affinity than that of non-biodegradable plastic, their plastispheres are assumed to be different. This review summarizes the reported differences in microbial communities on the surface of biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, discusses the driving forces behind these differences, and discusses the potential environmental risks. Overall, the plastisphere biomass on the surface of non-biodegradable plastic was observed to be lower than that of biodegradable plastic. The community structure of microbes in both plastispheres was diverse, mainly due to the properties of the plastic surface, such as surface charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, roughness, and bioavailability of polymer components for microbes. Further research should focus on developing biodegradable plastic that degrade faster in the environment, revealing the mechanism of enrichment of ARGs and potential pathogens on plastics, and understanding the potential influence of plastispheres on the evolution and selection of plastic-degrading microbial potential.","Peng C., Wang J., Liu X., Wang L.",10.3389/fmicb.2022.849147,Frontiers In Microbiology
Impact Of Antibiotics On Microbial Community In Aquatic Environment And Biodegradation Mechanism: A Review And Bibliometric Analysis,"Antibiotic residues in aquatic environments pose a potential hazard, and microbes, which play important roles in aquatic ecosystems, are vulnerable to the impacts of antibiotics. This study aimed to analyze the research progress, trends, and hot topics of the impact of antibiotics on microbial community and biodegradation mechanism using bibliometric analysis. An in-depth analysis of the publication characteristics of 6143 articles published between 1990 and 2021 revealed that the number of articles published increased exponentially. The research sites have been mainly concentrated in the Yamuna River, Pearl River, Lake Taihu, Lake Michigan, Danjiangkou Reservoir, etc., illustrating that research around the world is not even. Antibiotics could change the diversity, structure, and ecological functions of bacterial communities, stimulate a widespread abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes, and increase the diversity of eukaryotes, thus triggering the shift of food web structure to predatory and pathogenic. Latent Dirichlet allocation theme model analysis showed three clusters, and the research hotspots mainly included the effect of antibiotics on the denitrification process, microplastics combined with antibiotics, and methods for removing antibiotics. Furthermore, the mechanisms of microbe-mediated antibiotic degradation were unraveled, and importantly, we provided bottlenecks and future research perspectives on antibiotics and microbial diversity research.","Mu X., Huang Z., Ohore O.E., Yang J., Peng K., Li S., Li X.",10.1007/s11356-023-27018-w,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Detection Of Faecal Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Biofilms Attached To Plastics From Human-Impacted Coastal Areas,"Plastics have been proposed as vectors of bacteria as they act as a substrate for biofilms. In this study, we evaluated the abundance of faecal and marine bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from biofilms adhered to marine plastics. Floating plastics and plastics from sediments were collected in coastal areas impacted by human faecal pollution in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Culture and/or molecular methods were used to quantify faecal indicators (E. coli, Enterococci and crAssphage), and the ARGs sulI, tetW and bla(TEM) and the 16S rRNA were detected by qPCR assays. Pseudomonas and Vibrio species and heterotrophic marine bacteria were also analysed via culture-based methods. Results showed that, plastic particles covered by bacterial biofilms, primarily consisted of marine bacteria including Vibrio spp. Some floating plastics had a low concentration of viable E. coli and Enterococci (42% and 67% of the plastics respectively). Considering the median area of the plastics, we detected an average of 68 cfu E. coli per item, while a higher concentration of E. coli was detected on individual plastic items, when compared with 100 ml of the surrounding water. Using qPCR, we quantified higher values of faecal indicators which included inactive and dead microorganisms, detecting up to 2.6 × 10(2) gc mm(−2). The ARGs were detected in 67–88% of the floating plastics and in 29–57% of the sediment plastics with a concentration of up to 6.7 × 10(2) gc mm(−2). Furthermore, enrichment of these genes was observed in biofilms compared with the surrounding water. These results show that floating plastics act as a conduit for both the attachment and transport of faecal microorganisms. In contrast, low presence of faecal indicators was detected in plastic from seafloor sediments. Therefore, although in low concentrations, faecal bacteria, and potential pathogens, were identified in marine plastics, further suggesting plastics act as a reservoir of pathogens and ARGs.","Liang H., De Haan W.P., Cerdà-Domènech M., Méndez J., Lucena F., García-Aljaro C., Sanchez-Vidal A., Ballesté E.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120983,Environmental Pollution
Effects Comparison Between The Secondary Nanoplastics Released From Biodegradable And Conventional Plastics On The Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Between Bacteria,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have caused widespread concern because of their potential harm to environmental safety and human health. As substitutes for conventional plastics, the toxic effects of short-term degradation products of biodegradable plastics (polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)) on bacteria and their impact on ARGs transfer were the focus of this study. After 60 days of degradation, more secondary nanoplastics were released from the biodegradable plastics PLA and PHA than that from the conventional plastics polystyrene (PS). All kinds of nanoplastics, no matter released from biodegradable plastics or conventional plastics, had no significant toxicity to bacteria. Nanoplastic particles from biodegradable plastics could significantly increase the transfer efficiency of ARGs. Although the amount of secondary nanoplastics produced by PHA microplastics was much higher than that of PLA, the transfer frequency after exposure to PLA was much higher, which may be due to the agglomeration of PHA nanoplastics caused by plastic instability in solution. After exposure to the 60 d PLA nanoplastics, the transfer frequency was the highest, which was approximately 28 times higher than that of control. The biodegradable nanoplastics significantly enhanced the expression of the outer membrane pore protein genes ompA and ompC, which could increase cell membrane permeability. The expression levels of trfAp and trbBp were increased by repressed major global regulatory genes korA, korB, and trbA, which eventually led to an increase in conjugative transfer frequency. This study provides important insights into the evaluation of the environmental and health risks caused by secondary nanoplastics released from biodegradable plastics.","Liu X., Wang X., Wang R., Guo S., Ahmad S., Song Y., Gao P., Chen J., Liu C., Ding N.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120680,Environmental Pollution
Quantifying Health Risks Of Plastisphere Antibiotic Resistome And Deciphering Driving Mechanisms In An Urbanizing Watershed,"Microplastics (MPs) ubiquitous in environments promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), threatening ecosystem safety and human health. However, quantitative assessments of the health risks of ARGs (HRA) in plastisphere and an in-depth exploration of their driving mechanisms are still lacking. Here, the microbiomes, ARGs, and community assembly processes of five types of MPs in an urbanizing watershed were systematically investigated. By fully considering the abundance, clinical availability, human pathogenicity, human accessibility, and mobility of 660 ARGs in plastisphere, the HRA on MPs were quantified and compared. Polyethylene had the highest HRA among the five MP types, and urbanization further increased its risk index. In addition to abiotic factors, more complex biotic factors have been shown to drive HRA in plastisphere. Specifically, dispersal limitation accounted for the increasing diversity and interaction of bacteria that determined HRA in plastisphere. Further analysis of metabolic functions indicated that a higher HRA was accompanied by decreased normal metabolic functions of plastisphere microbiota due to the higher fitness costs of ARGs. This study advances the quantitative surveillance of HRA in plastisphere and understanding of its driving mechanisms. This will be helpful for the management of both MPs and ARGs treatments for human health.","Zhu L., Li R., Yang K., Xu F., Lin C., Chen Q., Zhu D., Sun Q., Zhu Y.-G., Cui L.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120574,Water Research
Supermicrosurgical Lymphovenous Anastomosis For The Treatment Of Recurrent Cellulitis-Associated Lymphedema In The Lower Limb,"Recurrent leg cellulitis can damage the lymphatic system and result in chronic lymphedema. Antibiotic therapy is administered to prevent cellulitis; however, antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently occur. Supermicrosurgical lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) can play a role in stopping the vicious circle by improving lymph circulation. In the present report, we have described the case of a 40-year-old male patient with frequent cellulitis and subsequent left leg edema. Based on the lymphoscintigraphy findings, LVA was performed on the left leg (six anastomoses). One year later, the lymphedema had subsided without further cellulitis. Lymphoscintigraphy revealed no dermal backflow. Thus, LVA is a treatment option for recurrent cellulitis-associated lymphedema.",Lin C.H.,10.1016/j.jvscit.2021.10.011,"Journal Of Vascular Surgery Cases, Innovations And Techniques"
Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics Disseminate Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Chinese Soil: A Metagenomic Analysis,"The widespread prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment poses concerns as they are vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The relationships between antibiotic resistomes and MPs remain unexplored in soil which was considered as the reservoirs of MPs and ARGs. This study investigated the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs on soil bacterial communities and ARG abundance which soil samples sourced from 20 provinces across China. We found that PVC significantly influences soil bacterial community structure and ARG abundance. Structural equation modeling revealed that PVC alters soil characteristics, ultimately affecting soil bacterial communities, including ARG-containing bacterial hosts, and the relative abundance of ARGs. This study enhances our understanding of how MPs influence the proliferation and hosts of ARGs within diverse soil environments, offering crucial insights for future strategies in plastic management and disposal.","Zhao S., Zhang Q., Huang Q., Zhang C., Li H., Siddique K.H.M.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135727,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microbial Communities Colonising Plastics During Transition From The Wastewater Treatment Plant To Marine Waters,"Background: Plastics pollution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are two major environmental threats, but potential connections between plastic associated biofilms, the ‘plastisphere’, and dissemination of AMR genes are not well explored. Results: We conducted mesocosm experiments tracking microbial community changes on plastic surfaces transitioning from wastewater effluent to marine environments over 16 weeks. Commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) incubated in wastewater effluent, river water, estuarine water, and in the seawater for 16 weeks, were analysed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Within one week, plastic-colonizing communities shifted from wastewater effluent-associated microorganisms to marine taxa, some members of which (e.g. Oleibacter-Thalassolituus and Sphingomonas spp., on PET, Alcanivoracaceae on PET and PP, or Oleiphilaceae, on all polymers), were selectively enriched from levels undetectable in the starting communities. Remarkably, microbial biofilms were also susceptible to parasitism, with Saprospiraceae feeding on biofilms at late colonisation stages (from week 6 onwards), while Bdellovibrionaceae were prominently present on HDPE from week 2 and LDPE from day 1. Relative AMR gene abundance declined over time, and plastics did not become enriched for key AMR genes after wastewater exposure. Conclusion: Although some resistance genes occurred during the mesocosm transition on plastic substrata, those originated from the seawater organisms. Overall, plastic surfaces incubated in wastewater did not act as hotspots for AMR proliferation in simulated marine environments.","Tulloch C.L., Bargiela R., Williams G.B., Chernikova T.N., Cotterell B.M., Wellington E.M.H., Christie-Oleza J., Thomas D.N., Jones D.L., Golyshin P.N.",10.1186/s40793-024-00569-2,Environmental Microbiome
Microplastics As Vectors Of Chemical Contaminants And Biological Agents In Freshwater Ecosystems: Current Knowledge Status And Future Perspectives,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous, and their environmental fate is becoming an issue of concern. Our review aims to synthesize current knowledge status and provide future perspectives regarding the vector effect of MPs for chemical contaminants and biological agents. The evidence in the literature indicates that MPs are a vector for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and pharmaceuticals. Concentrations of chemical contaminant in orders of six-fold higher on MPs surfaces than in the surrounding environmental waters have been reported. Chemical pollutants such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PAFSs), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), exhibiting polarities in the range of 3.3–9 are the commonest chemicals reported on MP surfaces. Regarding metals on MPs including chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), the presence of C–O and N–H in MPs promote a relatively high adsorption of these metals onto MP surfaces. Regarding pharmaceuticals, not much has been done, but a few studies indicate that commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen have been associated with MPs. There is sufficient evidence supporting the claim that MPs can act as vectors for viruses, bacterial and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, and MPs act to accelerate horizontal and vertical gene transfer. An area that deserves urgent attention is whether MPs can act as vectors for invertebrates and vertebrates, mainly non-native, invasive freshwater species. Despite the ecological significance of invasive biology, little research has been done in this regard. Overall, our review summarises the state of the current knowledge, identifies critical research gaps and provides perspectives for future research.","Tumwesigye E., Felicitas Nnadozie C., C Akamagwuna F., Siwe Noundou X., William Nyakairu G., Odume O.N.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121829,Environmental Pollution
Microplastics Existence Intensified Bloom Of Antibiotic Resistance In Livestock Feces Transformed By Black Soldier Fly,"Efficient degradation of residual antibiotics in livestock and poultry feces by black soldier flies (BSFs) has been widely reported. Nevertheless, the effects of widely detected microplastics in feces on the dynamic reduction of antibiotics and the transfer of gut bacterial resistome remain unclear. In this study, red fluorescence-labeled microplastics are observed to be abundantly distributed in BSFs gut, which caused epithelial cell damage along with gut peristalsis and friction, thereby releasing reactive oxygen species and activating the antioxidant enzyme system. In addition, they result in not only in inflammatory cytokine release to induce gut inflammation, but fecal hardening because of mucus released from the BSFs, thereby hindering organic mineralization and antibiotic degradation. Besides, the gut pathogenic bacteria easily obtain growth energy and crowded out ecological niches by reducing nitrate produced by inflammatory host cells to nitrite with nitrate reductase. Consequently, linear discriminant analysis effect size and detrended correspondence analysis found that microplastic intake significantly reshape the microbial community structure and cause the significant reduction of several important organic-decomposing bacteria and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomonadales, Coriobacteriales, Lachnospirales, and Ruminococcaceae). In addition, a large number of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcaceae, Hungateiclostridiaceae, and Clostridia) are enriched in feces and BSFs gut. Weighted correlation network analysis and bubble diagram analysis indicate that microplastic intake intensified gut colonization of pathogenic bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes/mobile genetic elements, driving the bloom of antibiotic resistance in transformed fecal piles. Therefore, microplastics in feces should be isolated as much as possible before insect transformation.","Xu Z., Wu X., Zhang J., Cheng P., Xu Z., Sun W., Zhong Y., Wang Y., Yu G., Liu H.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120845,Environmental Pollution
Impact Of Pvc Microplastics In Photodynamic Inactivation Of Staphylococcus Aureus And Mrsa,"Photodynamic processes have found widespread application in therapies. These processes involve photosensitizers (PSs) that, when excited by specific light wavelengths and in the presence of molecular oxygen, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), that target cells leading to inactivation. Photodynamic action has gained notable attention in environmental applications, particularly against pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) that pose a significant challenge to public health. However, environmental matrices frequently encompass additional contaminants and interferents, including microplastics (MPs), which are pollutants of current concern. Their presence in water and effluents has been extensively documented, highlighting their impact on conventional treatment methods, but this information remains scarce in the context of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) setups. Here, we described the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microparticles in PDI targeting Staphylococcus aureus and its methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA), using curcumin as a PS under blue light. The presence of PVC microparticles does not hinder ROS formation; however, depending on its concentration, it can impact bacterial inactivation. Our results underscore that PDI remains a potent method for reducing bacterial concentrations in water and wastewater containing ARB, even in highly contaminated scenarios with MPs.","Lima A.R., Sammarro Silva K.J., Aguiar A.S.N., De Souza M., Nunes Lima T.H., Blanco K.C., Bagnato V.S., Dias L.D.",10.2166/wst.2024.104,Water Science And Technology
"Metagenomic Insights Into The Potential Risks Of Representative Bio/Non-Degradable Plastic And Non-Plastic Debris In The Upper And Lower Reaches Of Haihe Estuary, China","As vectors for microorganisms and genetic elements, vast amounts of solid wastes, including plastics and non-plastics, enter oceans through estuaries globally. The heterogeneity of microbiomes developed on different types of plastic and non-plastic matrices and their potential environmental risks in field estuarine regions have not been fully explored. Here, microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factors (VFs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) on substrate debris (SD) covering non-biodegradable plastics, biodegradable plastics, and non-plastics were first comprehensively characterized based on metagenomic analyzes (substrate identity). These selected substrates were field-exposed at both ends of the Haihe Estuary, China (geographic location). For substrate identity: conspicuously diverse functional gene profiles on different substrates were obtained; the relative gene copies of ARGs, VFs, and MGEs on non-biodegradable plastics were highest at both locations; non-biodegradable plastic matrices recruited the most abundant unique ARGs from ambient waters; the relative abundance of potential bacterial hosts carrying multiple ARGs and VFs (BH-AV) was much higher on non-biodegradable plastic surfaces than on the other two substrates, especially in the coastal water environment. For geographic locations: more abundant specific ARGs, VFs, and MGEs were significantly enriched on SD from the upper estuary; the average relative abundance of identified BH-AV on SD from the upper estuary was 1.99–7.14 folds from the lower estuary. Finally, the results of the Projection Pursuit Regression model verified the higher comprehensive potential risks arising from non-biodegradable plastics (substrate identity) and SD from the upstream of the estuary (geographic location). Based on comparative analysis, our results alert us to pay particular attention to ecological risks triggered by conventional non-biodegradable plastics in rivers and coastal environments and highlight the microbiological risk from terrestrial solid waste to the downstream marine environment.","Zhao X., Niu Z., Ma Y., Zhang Y., Li Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164026,Science Of The Total Environment
Potential Routes Of Plastics Biotransformation Involving Novel Plastizymes Revealed By Global Multi-Omic Analysis Of Plastic Associated Microbes,"Despite increasing efforts across various disciplines, the fate, transport, and impact of synthetic plastics on the environment and public health remain poorly understood. To better elucidate the microbial ecology of plastic waste and its potential for biotransformation, we conducted a large-scale analysis of all publicly available meta-omic studies investigating plastics (n = 27) in the environment. Notably, we observed low prevalence of known plastic degraders throughout most environments, except for substantial enrichment in riverine systems. This indicates rivers may be a highly promising environment for discovery of novel plastic bioremediation products. Ocean samples associated with degrading plastics showed clear differentiation from non-degrading polymers, showing enrichment of novel putative biodegrading taxa in the degraded samples. Regarding plastisphere pathogenicity, we observed significant enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes on plastics but not of virulence factors. Additionally, we report a co-occurrence network analysis of 10 + million proteins associated with the plastisphere. This analysis revealed a localized sub-region enriched with known and putative plastizymes-these may be useful for deeper investigation of nature's ability to biodegrade man-made plastics. Finally, the combined data from our meta-analysis was used to construct a publicly available database, the Plastics Meta-omic Database (PMDB)-accessible at plasticmdb.org. These data should aid in the integrated exploration of the microbial plastisphere and facilitate research efforts investigating the fate and bioremediation potential of environmental plastic waste.","Ridley R.S., Conrad R.E., Lindner B.G., Woo S., Konstantinidis K.T.",10.1038/s41598-024-59279-x,Scientific Reports

Impact Of Wound Microbiology On Limb Preservation In Patients With Diabetic Foot Infection,"Aims/Introduction:: To investigate the association between specific bacterial pathogens and treatment outcome in patients with limb-threatening diabetic foot infection (LT-DFI). Materials and Methods:: Consecutive patients treated for LT-DFI in a major diabetic foot center in Taiwan were analyzed between the years 2014 and 2017. Patients with positive wound culture results at first aid were enrolled. Clinical factors, laboratory data, and wound culture results were compared. Lower-extremity amputations and in-hospital mortality were defined as a poor outcome. Results:: Among the 558 patients, 272 (48.7%) patients had lower extremity amputation and 22 (3.9%) patients had in-hospital mortality. Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) infection was the independent factor following factors adjustment. When all the 31 microorganisms were analyzed, only E. coli (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.01; 95% CI, 1.60–5.65), Proteus spp. (aOR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.69–5.29), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (aOR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.20–3.32) were associated with poor outcome. The analysis of specific GNB species in association with major- or minor- amputation have been reported. No specific pathogen was associated with cause of death in patients with mortality within 30 days. The antimicrobial-resistant strains were not associated with a poor treatment outcome. Conclusions:: The presence of GNB was associated with limb amputations. This study provides insight into more timely and appropriate management of the diabetic foot infection.","Hung S.-Y., Chiu C.-H., Huang C.-H., Lin C.-W., Yeh J.-T., Yang H.-M., Huang Y.-Y.",10.1111/jdi.13649,Journal Of Diabetes Investigation
Overview Of African Water Resources Contamination By Contaminants Of Emerging Concern,"This review look at several classes of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in conventional and non-conventional water resources across the African continent's five regions. According to the review, pharmaceuticals, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, personal care products, pesticides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds, and microplastics were found in conventional and non-conventional water resources. Most conventional water resources, such as rivers, streams, lakes, wells, and boreholes, are used as drinking water sources. Non-conventional water sources, such as treated wastewater (effluents), are used for domestic and agricultural purposes. However, CECs remain part of the treated wastewater, which is being discharged to surface water or used for agriculture. Thus, wastewater (effluent) is the main contributor to the pollution of other water resources. For African countries, the prevalence of rising emerging pollutants in water poses a severe environmental threat. There are different adverse effects of CECs, including the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ecotoxicological effects, and several endocrine disorders. Therefore, this needs the urgent attention of the African Union, policymakers, Non-Governmental Organizations, and researchers to come together and tackle the problem.","Shehu Z., Nyakairu G.W.A., Tebandeke E., Odume O.N.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158303,Science Of The Total Environment
Phthalates Promote Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: An Overlooked Environmental Risk,"Plastics-microorganism interactions have aroused growing environmental and ecological concerns. However, previous studies concentrated mainly on the direct interactions and paid little attention to the ecotoxicology effects of phthalates (PAEs), a common plastic additive that is continuously released and accumulates in the environment. Here, we provide insights into the impacts of PAEs on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among environmental microorganisms. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP, a model PAE) at environmentally relevant concentrations (2-50 μg/L) significantly boosted the plasmid-mediated conjugation transfer of ARGs among intrageneric, intergeneric, and wastewater microbiota by up to 3.82, 4.96, and 4.77 times, respectively. The experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results unveil a strong interaction between the DMP molecules and phosphatidylcholine bilayer of the cell membrane, which lowers the membrane lipid fluidity and increases the membrane permeability to favor transfer of ARGs. In addition, the increased reactive oxygen species generation and conjugation-associated gene overexpression under DMP stress also contribute to the increased gene transfer. This study provides fundamental knowledge of the PAE-bacteria interactions to broaden our understanding of the environmental and ecological risks of plastics, especially in niches with colonized microbes, and to guide the control of ARG environmental spreading.","Wu J., Zhou J.-H., Liu D.-F., Wu J., He R.-L., Cheng Z.-H., Li H.-H., Li W.-W.",10.1021/acs.est.2c09491,Environmental Science And Technology
Review: Lessons Learned From Clinical Trials Using Antimicrobial Peptides (Amps),"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or host defense peptides protect the host against various pathogens such as yeast, fungi, viruses and bacteria. AMPs also display immunomodulatory properties ranging from the modulation of inflammatory responses to the promotion of wound healing. More interestingly, AMPs cause cell disruption through non-specific interactions with the membrane surface of pathogens. This is most likely responsible for the low or limited emergence of bacterial resistance against many AMPs. Despite the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the potency of novel AMPs to combat such pathogens, only a few AMPs are in clinical use. Therefore, the current review describes (i) the potential of AMPs as alternatives to antibiotics, (ii) the challenges toward clinical implementation of AMPs and (iii) strategies to improve the success rate of AMPs in clinical trials, emphasizing the lessons we could learn from these trials.","Dijksteel G.S., Ulrich M.M.W., Middelkoop E., Boekema B.K.H.L.",10.3389/fmicb.2021.616979,Frontiers In Microbiology
Culturing The Plastisphere: Comparing Methods To Isolate Culturable Bacteria Colonising Microplastics,"Microplastics quickly become colonised by diverse microbial communities, known as the Plastisphere. There is growing concern that microplastics may support the enrichment and spread of pathogenic or antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, although research to support the unique role of microplastics in comparison to control particles remains inconclusive. Limitations to this research include the microbiological methods available for isolating adhered microbes. Culture-based methods provide some of the most established, accessible and cost-effective microbiological protocols, which could be extremely useful in helping to address some of the remaining key questions in Plastisphere research. Previous works have successfully cultured bacteria from plastics, but these have not yet been reviewed, nor compared in efficiency. In this study, we compared four common biofilm extraction methods (swabbing, sonication, vortexing, sonication followed by vortexing) to extract and culture a mixed community of bacteria from both microplastic (polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene) and control (wood and glass) particles. Biofilm extraction efficiency and viability of bacterial suspension was determined by comparing CFU/mL of four different groups of bacteria. This was verified against optical density and 16S rRNA qPCR. Overall, we found that all tested methods were able to remove biofilms, but to varying efficiencies. Sonicating particles with glass beads for 15 min, followed by vortexing for a further minute, generated the highest yield and therefore greatest removal efficiency of culturable, biofilm-forming bacteria.","Stevenson E.M., Buckling A., Cole M., Lindeque P.K., Murray A.K.",10.3389/fmicb.2023.1259287,Frontiers In Microbiology

Essential Oils From Emilia Romagna Apennines (Italy): Phytochemical Composition And Antimicrobial Activity On Food-Borne Pathogens,"Between Modena and Bologna Apennines (Italy), several agricultural farms have recently been dedicated to the cultivation of autochthonous aromatic plants as primary cultivation or to complement other crops. In this study, the chemical composition of Thymus vulgaris L. essential oils (EOs) from this region was evaluated by means of gas-chromatographic analysis. Three different mulching techniques, in particular, soil coverage with grass, mulch with plastic film and with straw were investigated. The results highlighted that mulching techniques influenced the composition of the analysed EOs. All the EOs exerted good antimicrobial activity against clinical and food strains of the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, with differences related to the composition. The EO obtained from plants covered with grass showed the best results, having MIC ≤ 2.5 µL/mL, and being able to inhibit also antibiotic-resistant strains, thus confirming that soil coverage with grass influences the composition and also the biological activity of Thymus vulgaris EO.","Tardugno R., Serio A., Purgatorio C., Savini V., Paparella A., Benvenuti S.",10.1080/14786419.2020.1798666,Natural Product Research
Microplastisphere May Induce The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Aquatic Environments: A Review,"Microplastics have been proven to be hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The enrichment of ARGs in microplastisphere, the specific niche for diverse microbial communities attached to the surface of microplastic, has attracted worldwide attention. By collecting 477 pairs of ARG abundance data belonging to 26 ARG types, based on the standardized mean difference (SMD) under the random effect model, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the ARG enrichment on microplastics in aquatic environments in order to quantitatively elucidate the enrichment effect, with comparison of non-microplastic materials. It was found that ARGs enriched on the microplastics were more abundant than that on the inorganic substrates (SMD = 0.26) and natural water environments (SMD = 0.10), but lower abundant than that on the natural organic substrates (SMD = −0.52). Furthermore, microplastics in freshwater tended to have a higher degree of ARG enrichment than those in saline water and sewage. The biofilm formation stage, structure, and component of microplastisphere may play a significant role in the enrichment of ARGs.","Yu X., Zhang Y., Tan L., Han C., Li H., Zhai L., Ma W., Li C., Lu X.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119891,Environmental Pollution
"Selectively Enrichment Of Antibiotics And Args By Microplastics In River, Estuary And Marine Waters","The partition of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between the microplastics (MPs) and the surrounding water with various salinity are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that adsorption of antibiotics on MPs might cause a significant change of the structure of microbial communities, diversity and abundance of ARGs on MPs and this might be further affected by change of salinity. In this study, we investigated adsorption of four common antibiotics (sulfamerazine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and tylosin) to polyethylene (PE) MPs in river, estuary and marine waters, and the differences of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities on MPs and in the three waters. The results showed that MPs can enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbes from the surrounding water. Elevated salinity could reduce adsorption of antibiotics to MPs and the abundance of ARGs. For example, MPs can concentrate more antibiotics and ARGs in the fresh river water than in the estuary and the marine waters. In addition, ARGs and bacterial communities on MPs at various salinity were significantly different under the pressure of four antibiotics. On MPs, sul1, sulA/folP-01, tetA, tetC, tetX and ermE increased significantly but a few new ARGs such as sulA/folP-01 and tetA appeared. The structure of the bacterial communities on MPs was different from the surrounding water since some bacteria species found on MPs were barely detected in the surrounding water while some genera on MPs vanished after exposure to antibiotics. As the antibiotics adsorbed and the ARGs on MPs decreased with the water salinity, the structure of the communities on MPs thus varied with salinity change. These findings are important to understand the effects of MPs on the transport, fate and ecological risk of antibiotics and ARGs in different aquatic environments.","Wang S., Xue N., Li W., Zhang D., Pan X., Luo Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134594,Science Of The Total Environment
Multilocus Sequence Typing And Molecular Characterization Of Β-Lactamase Genes Among Acinetobacter Baumannii Isolates In A Burn Center,"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is one of the leading pathogens in hospital infections. To characterize the epidemiology of A. baumannii in a burn ward, we collected all A. baumannii isolates though 18 months. Antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic resistant genes were tested. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was further used to molecularly subtype these isolates. These isolates showed a severe multidrug resistant phenotype with 85% resistance to imipenem and meropenem. Along with the resistant phenotype, antibiotic resistant genes were widely found among these isolates. The prevalences of OXA23, AmpC, PER and VIM were 65.1%, 84%, 37.7% and 53%, respectively. Fifteen reported STs and sixteen novel STs were found in this study. ST368 (35%) was the dominant type, followed by ST195 (15%), ST191 (12%), ST369 (10%) and ST208 (10%). Majority (82.8%) of these isolates belong to clonal group 92, indicating the nosocomial spreading of A. baumannii. Further monitoring and control measures for A. baumannii spreading are necessary.","Huang G., Peng Y., Yang Y., Tang C., Fu Y.",10.1016/j.burns.2017.03.020,Burns
Distribution Characteristics Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Different Water Supply Pipes,"To study the distribution characteristics and horizontal transfer potential of antibiotic resistance genes in biofilms of water supply pipes made of different materials, the biofilms of 304 and 316 L stainless steel pipes and PPR and PE plastic pipes were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that a total of 146 antibiotic resistance genes belonging to 17 classes were detected in the biofilms. Multidrug resistance genes had the highest abundance and varied a lot in different biofilms, which was the main reason for the differences in antibiotic resistance genes in different biofilms. The total abundance of mobile genetic elements was high in different biofilms, but overall coexistence with antibiotic resistance genes was low, with integrase genes showing a closer relationship with antibiotic resistance genes and possibly playing an important role in the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Different antibiotic resistance genes possessed different genera of potential hosts; highly abundant hosts such as Aquabacterium and Bradyrhizobium were the basis for the presence of a high abundance of multidrug resistance genes. Microbial attachment in different pipe walls was selective, and the primary influence of antibiotic resistance in biofilms was bacterial community composition, followed by the horizontal transfer of genes mediated by mobile genetic elements, community composition, and mobile genetic elements together shaping the distribution characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes.","Liu C.-X., Bai X.-H.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202204208,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Microplastic-Induced Alterations To Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Seawater,"The increasing and combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments is a great ecological and health concern. However, MP-induced alterations to ARGs in seawater is poorly understood, impeding risk assessment of plastics. We profiled the diversity and abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in seawater after the addition of three different MPs (PE, PVC, and PVA) and 49-day aerated incubation.A total of 20, 35, 42, and 64 ARGs were detected in BLK, PE, PVC, and PVA, with 2, 4, 2, and 3 MGEs, respectively. The absolute abundance of ARGs in the seawater aerated with MPs ranged from 4.01×106 copies ·L-1 to 1.05×108 copies ·L-1. Additionally, the variety and richness of ARGs and MGEs in PVA were significantly higher than in the original seawater, or the seawater aerated with the other two MPs. This indicates that PVA, which is water soluble, could induce more diverse and abundant ARGs in seawater. Significant correlations among ARGs, MGEs, and 16S rRNA genes were observed, implying that the occurrence of MGEs in seawater may accelerate the transmission of ARGs through horizontal gene transfer, and bacterial microorganisms could directly affect the propagation and dissemination of ARGs.","Zhou S.-Y.-D., Zhu Y.-G., Huang F.-Y.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202101009,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Plastic Wastes And Surface Antibiotic Resistance Genes Pollution In Mangrove Environments,"Mangroves are located at the intersection of land and sea and are also heavily affected by plastic wastes. Biofilms of plastic wastes in mangroves are reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, plastic wastes and ARG pollution were investigated from three typical mangrove areas in Zhanjiang, South China. Transparent was the dominant colors of plastic wastes in three mangroves. Fragment and film shape accounted for 57.73–88.23% of plastic waste samples in mangroves. In addition, 39.50% of plastic wastes in protected area mangroves are PS. The metagenomic results shows that the 175 ARGs were found on plastic wastes of the three mangroves, the abundance accounting for 91.11% of the total ARGs. The abundance of Vibrio accounted for 2.31% of the total bacteria genera in aquaculture pond area mangrove. Correlation analysis shows that a microbe can carry multiple ARGs that may improve resistance to antibiotics. Microbes are the potential hosts of most ARGs, suggesting that ARGs can be transmitted by microbes. Because the mangroves are closely related to human activities and the high abundance of ARGs on plastic increases the ecological risks, people should improve plastic waste management and prevent the spread of ARGs by reducing plastic pollution.

Photoaged Nanoplastics With Multienzyme-Like Activities Significantly Shape The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Nanoplastics (NPs), identified as emerging pollutants, pose a great risk to environment and global public health, exerting profound influences on the prevalence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite evidence suggesting that nano-sized plastic particles can facilitate the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, it is imperative to explore strategies for inhibiting the transfer of ARGs. Currently, limited information exists regarding the characteristics of environmentally aged NPs and their impact on ARGs propagation. Herein, we investigated the impact of photo-aged NPs on the transfer of ARG-carrying plasmids into Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. Following simulated sunlight irradiation, photo-aged nano-sized polystyrene plastics (PS NPs) exhibited multiple enzyme-like activities, including peroxidase (POD) and oxidase (OXD), leading to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At relatively low concentrations (0.1, 1 μg/mL), both pristine and aged PS NPs facilitated the transfer of pUC19 and pHSG396 plasmids within E. coli due to moderate ROS production and enhanced cell membrane permeability. Intriguingly, at relatively high concentrations (5, 10 μg/mL), aged PS NPs significantly suppressed plasmids transformation. The non-unidirectional impact of aged PS NPs involved the overproduction of ROS (•OH and •O(2)(−)) via nanozyme activity, directly degrading ARGs and damaging plasmid structure. Additionally, oxidative damage to bacteria resulted from the presence of much toxic free radicals, causing physical damage to cell membranes, reduction of the SOS response and restriction of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) supply, ultimately leading to inactivation of recipient cells. This study unveils the intrinsic multienzyme-like activity of environmentally aged NPs, highlighting their potential to impede the transfer and dissemination of ARGs.","Chen M.-M., Zhang Y.-Q., Cheng L.-C., Zhao F.-J., Wang P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134884,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plastic Properties Affect The Composition Of Prokaryotic And Eukaryotic Communities And Further Regulate The Args In Their Surface Biofilms,"Plastic wastes are ubiquitous in the offshore and oceans with an increasing quantity, and inevitably, microbial communities colonized the plastics to form biofilms, which have become dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the impact of plastic properties including hardness, wettability, and zeta-potential on the biomass, prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities and ARGs in biofilms formed on specific plastics (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) in an estuarine environment. The results showed that, in comparison to PP, more biomass characterized by more dry weight, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total organic carbon (TOC) was found in biofilms formed on PE and PET, which may be related to their lower surface wettability. Proteobacteria were the dominant prokaryotic phyla, and they accounted for 53.06%, 81.90%, 37.06%, 76.25%, and 54.27% of the total sequences in biofilms on PE, PP, PET, water and sediment, respectively. Ascomycota were the predominant eukaryotic phyla in biofilms, water, and sediment, and their abundances were elevated in biofilms on PP, which accounted for 34.73%. The biofilms on PP had a higher relative abundance of ARGs (3.13) compared to those on PE (2.59) and PET (0.23). Furthermore, both the plastic-biofilm properties (e.g. dry weight, Chl a, and TOC) and microbial communities (e.g., Fungi and Proteobacteria) may be involved in regulating the abundance of ARGs. Moreover, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly correlated to both the absolute and relative abundance of ARGs, indicating that MGEs may regulate the migration of ARGs in biofilms. Taken together, this investigation provides the significance of the plastic type, surface properties, and surrounding environments in shaping microbial communities and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics.","Guo X.-P., Chen Y.-R., Sun X.-L., Li C.-L., Hou L.-J., Liu M., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156362,Science Of The Total Environment
"Marine Microplastics Enrich Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args), Especially Extracellular Args: An Investigation In The East China Sea","The potential of microplastics to carry coexisting pollutants and contribute to combined pollution is a significant health concern. Here we investigate the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and extracellular ARGs (eARGs) forms, on microplastics collected from the coastal waters of the East China Sea. Our findings revealed that both iARGs and eARGs were enriched on microplastics. Specifically, 6- to 55-fold enrichment of iARGs was found on microplastics, while eARGs were more significantly enriched (5–140 fold). 16s rDNA analysis revealed that microplastics harbored a more diverse microbial community, particularly opportunistic pathogens, compared to surrounding seawater. This contributes to more correlations between bacterial genera and ARGs on microplastics than in sea water. Molecular ecological network analysis indicated that total nitrogen and ammonia were primary determinants of ARG and microbial enrichment on microplastics. This study provides implications for understanding the combined pollution of microplastics and ARGs.","Peng R., Xu Y., Li R., Wang W., Wang H., Zhang X., Yuan Q.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117260,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Antibiotic Susceptibility Of Wound Swab Isolates In A Tertiary Hospital In Southwest Nigeria,"Background: Wounds are commonly encountered in the clinical practice. Microbacterial colonization and infection negatively affect wound outcomes. With increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, it is essential to determine local patterns of wound microbiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility to guide rational empirical antibiotic use. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients who presented to the plastic surgery unit were recruited to the study over a 6-month period. Wound swab cultures were performed at presentation using standard protocols and media. The wound swab was performed by the Levine technique and data were analyzed using a statistical software package. Results: Eighty-five microbial isolates were obtained from the eighty patients (55 males and 25 females) recruited. Gram-positive isolates were 35 (41.2%) and Gram-negative were 50 (58.8%). There was equal distribution of acute and chronic wounds. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolate at 30.6%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (27.1%), Escherichia coli (9.4%), Streptococcus species (8.2%), and Morganella morganii (7.1%). The isolates demonstrated resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime; low-to-moderate sensitivity to erythromycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin; and a moderate sensitivity to ceftriaxone and a high sensitivity to imipenem. There was significant difference in antibiotic resistance patterns between Gram-positive isolates from acute and chronic wound infections but not for acute and chronic wound Gram-negative isolates. Conclusion: Most of the microbial isolates, particularly the Gram-negative isolates demonstrated low sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics and moderate-to-high sensitivity to less commonly used newer antibiotics.","Omoyibo E.E., Oladele A.O., Ibrahim M.H., Adekunle O.T.",10.4103/aam.aam_22_17,Annals Of African Medicine
Current State Of Compassionate Phage Therapy,"There is a current unmet medical need for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections, and in the absence of approved alternatives, some clinicians are turning to empirical ones, such as phage therapy, for compassionate treatment. Phage therapy is ideal for compassionate use due to its long-standing historical use and publications, apparent lack of adverse effects, and solid support by fundamental research. Increased media coverage and peer-reviewed articles have given rise to a more widespread familiarity with its therapeutic potential. However, compassionate phage therapy (cPT) remains limited to a small number of experimental treatment centers or associated with individual physicians and researchers. It is possible, with the creation of guidelines and a greater central coordination, that cPT could reach more of those in need, starting by increasing the availability of phages. Subsequent steps, particularly production and purification, are difficult to scale, and treatment paradigms stand highly variable between cases, or are frequently not reported. This article serves both to synopsize cPT publications to date and to discuss currently available phage sources for cPT. As the antibiotic resistance crisis continues to grow and the future of phage therapy clinical trials remains undetermined, cPT represents a possibility for bridging the gap between current treatment failures and future approved alternatives. Streamlining the process of cPT will help to ensure high quality, therapeutically-beneficial, and safe treatment.","Mccallin S., Sacher J.C., Zheng J., Chan B.K.",10.3390/v11040343,Viruses
Genomic Characterisation Of Multidrug-Resistant Bacillus Toyonensis Strain 4Hc1 Isolated From Marine Plastic In Norway,"Objectives: Bacillus toyonensis is widespread in nature. Multidrug-resistant B. toyonensis strain 4HC1 was isolated from polyethylene submerged in the water column near a beach in Øygarden, Norway. We analysed the whole genome sequence of strain 4HC1 in order to understand the genetic basis of the observed phenotypic antibiotic resistance. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing of B. toyonensis strain 4HC1 was performed on Illumina MiSeq platform using 2 × 300 bp chemistry. The genome sequence was assembled using SPAdes v.3.13.0 and was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP). Results: The draft genome of strain 4HC1 is 6 156 259 bp (133 contigs) in size with a GC content of 34.95%. The genome comprises 6089 protein-coding genes, 86 tRNAs and 24 rRNAs. Strain 4HC1 is resistant to cefotaxime, trimethoprim and ampicillin and carries various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including several β-lactamases, aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a TetM family tetracycline resistance gene, two different tetracycline efflux pumps, and a bleomycin resistance gene. Several virulence genes including genes involved in immune evasion, iron acquisition and toxins were also detected in strain 4HC1. Conclusion: The draft genome sequence of B. toyonensis strain 4HC1 released here shows the presence of various ARGs and virulence genes in a multidrug-resistant strain isolated from marine plastic.","Radisic V., Marathe N.P.",10.1016/j.jgar.2021.07.002,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
Effect Of Microplastics Concentration And Size On Pollutants Removal And Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args) Generation In Constructed Wetlands: A Metagenomics Insight,"The accrual of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics poses synergistic threats to the environment. This study systemically examined the effect of environmental-level (μg/L) MPs (90–110 µm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 700 nm) on constructed wetlands (CWs) treating oxytetracycline-contaminated wastewater via metagenomics analysis. Polystyrene (PS) MPs notably hindered the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxytetracycline, particularly at high level (1000 μg/L), with removal rates of 73.34 %, 59.59 %, and 99.34 %, respectively. Among them, the removal of NH(4)(+)-N decreased the most in comparison to CK, at 15.26 %. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) copies/16S rRNA ranged from 0.26 to 0.42 in CWs, exceeding that found in rivers by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 times. The relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes (mdtB, acrB, mexF, mdtC, and mexT) and tetracycline resistance genes (txtA, tetG, and tetP) exhibited a pronounced increase under MPs exposure, ranging from 0.06 to 0.14 and 0.01 to 0.08 copies/16S rRNA, respectively. Redundancy and network analyses emphasized robust associations among contaminant reduction, ARG abundance, and microbial community. Partial least squares path modeling indicated MPs exerted a more profound influence on pollutant removal (coefficient = 0.8194), microbial community (coefficient = 0.3358) and ARGs dissemination (coefficient = 0.6566) compared to NPs. MPs concentrations significantly affects pollutants removal and ARGs proliferation, and MPs with larger sizes amplified ARG dissemination. This research highlights the influence of MPs on CW-mediated wastewater treatment and ARGs accumulation, offering valuable insights for developing ecological wastewater treatment strategies tailored to multi-pollutant scenarios. These insights are fundamental in developing sustainable solutions to the adverse impacts of MPs on ecosystems.","Liang L., Pan W., Mu M., Zhang L., Yang X., Zhang R., Du L., Guo X.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136555,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Effects Of Heavy Metal And Disinfectant On Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Virulence Factor Genes In The Plastisphere From Diverse Soil Ecosystems,"Antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) are world-wide contaminants posing potential health risks. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and heavy metals can apply selective pressure on antibiotic resistance. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding their coupled effect on changes in ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in various soil types and their plastispheres. Herein, we conducted a microcosm experiment to explore the abundances and profiles of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastispheres from three distinct types of soils amended with Cu and disinfectants. The plastispheres enriched the ARGs’ abundance compared to soils and stimulated the coupling effect of combined pollutants on promoting the abundances of ARGs and VFGs. Horizontal gene transfer inevitably accelerates the propagation of ARGs and VFGs in plastispheres under pollutant stress. In plastispheres, combined exposure to disinfectants and Cu increased some potential pathogens’ relative abundances. Moreover, the combined effect of disinfectants and Cu on ARGs and VFGs changed with soil type in plastispheres, emphasising the necessity to incorporate soil type considerations into health risk assessments for ARGs and VFGs. Overall, this study highlights the high health risks of ARGs under the selective pressure of combined pollutants in plastispheres and provides valuable insights for future risk assessments related to antibiotic resistance.","Ni B., Zhang T.-L., Cai T.-G., Xiang Q., Zhu D.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133335,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Occurrence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Carried By Plastic Waste From Mangrove Wetlands Of The South China Sea,"Plastic waste can carry organisms such as bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) over long distances. However, only few studies have been conducted on the occurrence of ARGs in plastic waste from mangrove wetlands. This study evaluated the distribution characteristics and ecological risks of plastic waste from mangroves in the coastal areas of the South China Sea. The correlation between anthropogenic activity levels and abundance of ARGs in mangroves was evaluated. Transparent and white were the common colors of plastic waste in mangroves. The main shapes of plastic waste were foam and film. The predominant types of plastic waste order were as follows: polyethylene (30.18 %) > polypropylene (27.51 %) > polystyrene (23.59 %). The living area (LA) mangroves had the highest polymer hazard and pollution load indices of 329.09 and 10.03, respectively. The abundance of ARGs (5.08 × 10(8) copies/g) on the plastic surface in LA mangroves was significantly higher than that of the other mangrove areas. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between ARGs and intI1 on the plastic surface in mangroves. Correlation analysis between the ARGs and intI1 showed that most of the ARGs were correlated with intI1 except for msbA. In LA mangroves, sociometric and environmental factors showed significant correlations with the absolute abundances of the four ARGs and intI1, indicating that anthropogenic activities may lead to changes in the amount of ARGs on plastic surfaces. Furthermore, the ARG storage of plastic waste from different mangroves was as follows: protected areas (3.12 × 10(17) copies) > living areas (2.99 × 10(17) copies) > aquaculture pond areas (2.88 × 10(17) copies). The higher ARG storage of LA mangroves, with the smallest area, greatly increased its ecological risk. The results of this study can provide basic data for processes that influence the distribution of plastic waste and ARGs in mangroves.","Sun R., Li T., Qiu S., Liu Y., Wu Z., Dai Z., Liao Y., Chen X., Chen S., Li C.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161111,Science Of The Total Environment
Interactions Between Microplastics And Organic Contaminants: The Microbial Mechanisms For Priming Effects Of Organic Compounds On Microplastic Biodegradation,"The co-presence of plastics and other organic contaminants is pervasive in various ecosystems, particularly in areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. Their interactions inevitably impact the composition and functions of the plastisphere microbiome, which in turn determines the trajectory of these contaminants. Antibiotics are a group of organic contaminants that warrant particular attention due to their wide presence in environments and significant potential to disseminate antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the plastisphere. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of sulfadiazine (SDZ), a prevalent environmental antibiotic, on the composition and function of the plastisphere microbial community inhabiting micro-polyethylene (mPE), one of the most common microplastic contaminants. Our findings indicated that the presence of SDZ increased the overall plastisphere microbial abundance and enriched populations that are capable of degrading both SDZ and mPE. The abundance of Aquabacterium, a dominant plastisphere population that is capable of degrading both SDZ and mPE, increased over the course of SDZ exposure, while another abundant mPE-degrading population, Ketobacter, remained stable. Accordingly, the removal of SDZ was enhanced in the presence of mPE. Moreover, the results further revealed that not only SDZ but also other labile organic contaminants (e.g., aniline and hexane) could accelerate mPE biodegradation through a priming effect. This investigation underscores the complex dynamics among microplastics, organic contaminants, and the plastisphere microbiome, offering insights into the environmental fate of plastic and antibiotic pollutants.","Chen Z., Sun W., Wang S., Yang J., Huang W., Huang D., Jiang K., Zhang X., Sun X.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122523,Water Research
"Sources, Interactions, Influencing Factors And Ecological Risks Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil: A Review","Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are gaining increasing attention as they pose a threat to the ecological environment and human health as emerging contaminants. MPs has been proved to be a hot spot in ARGs, and although it has been extensively studied in water environment, the results of bibliometrics statistical analysis in this paper showed that relevant studies in soil ecological environment are currently in the initial stage. In view of this, the paper provides a systematic review of the sources, interactions, influencing factors, and ecological risks associated with MPs and ARGs in soil environments. Additionally, the mechanism and influencing factors of plastisphere formation and resistance are elaborated in detail. The MPs properties, soil physicochemical properties, soil environmental factors and agricultural activities are the primarily factors affecting the interaction between MPs and ARGs in soil. Challenges and development directions of related research in the future are also prospected. It is hoped that the review could assist in a deeper comprehension and exploration of the interaction mechanism between MPs and ARGs in soil as well as the function of MPs in the transmission process of ARGs among diverse environmental media and organisms, and provide theory basis and reference for the MPs and ARGs pollution control and remediation in soil.","Zhang X., Zhao B., Zhang Y., Zhang J., Li Y., Zhong J., Diao J., Ma F., Liu H., Duan K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175226,Science Of The Total Environment
Bisphenol S Promotes The Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Via Transformation,"The antibiotic resistance crisis has seriously jeopardized public health and human safety. As one of the ways of horizontal transfer, transformation enables bacteria to acquire exogenous genes naturally. Bisphenol compounds are now widely used in plastics, food, and beverage packaging, and have become a new environmental pollutant. However, their potential relationship with the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to assess whether the ubiquitous bisphenol S (BPS) could promote the transformation of plasmid-borne ARGs. Using plasmid pUC19 carrying the ampicillin resistance gene as an extracellular ARG and model microorganism E. coli DH5α as the recipient, we established a transformation system. Transformation assays revealed that environmentally relevant concentrations of BPS (0.1–10 μg/mL) markedly enhanced the transformation frequency of plasmid-borne ARGs into E. coli DH5α up to 2.02-fold. Fluorescent probes and transcript-level analyses suggest that BPS stimulated increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activated the SOS response, induced membrane damage, and increased membrane fluidity, which weakened the barrier for plasmid transfer, allowing foreign DNA to be more easily absorbed. Moreover, BPS stimulates ATP supply by activating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which promotes flagellar motility and expands the search for foreign DNA. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the role of bisphenol compounds in facilitating the horizontal spread of ARGs and emphasize the need to monitor the residues of these environmental contaminants.","Zhang J., Zhu S., Sun J., Liu Y.",10.3390/ijms25189819,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Stable Closure Of Acute And Chronic Wounds And Pressure Ulcers And Control Of Draining Fistulas From Osteomyelitis In Persons With Spinal Cord Injuries: Non-Interventional Study Of Mppt Passive Immunotherapy Delivered Via Telemedicine In Community Care,"Background: Micropore particle technology (MPPT) is a topical wound treatment. It is a passive immunotherapy, acting via the skin and wound microbiome without the use of antimicrobial action. In a general patient population, it removed wound infections 60% and initiated tissue regeneration 50% quicker than antibiotics and antiseptics. As MPPT supports the immune system, the aim was to confirm that MPPT is also effective in immunocompromised individuals. People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are immunodeficient due to their injury and not an underlying disease and recruit 50% fewer immune cells to an injury. The study, therefore, determined the efficacy, safety, health economics, and sustainability of MPPT in acute and chronic wounds and pressure ulcers in this patient population. Methods: Pressure ulcers in SCI persons are an orphan indication, patient variability is high, and ICH E10 excludes comparators due to ethical concerns. The study design was, therefore, a single-arm, non-interventional, observational, post-market surveillance study of MPPT for treating wounds and pressure ulcers and removing soft tissue infection in connection with draining fistulas in SCI persons. The study was based on telemedicine in community care. Results: The study included 44 wounds. All acute and chronic grade 1–4 wounds and pressure ulcers reached stable closure. In wounds acting as fistulas draining from an underlying, primary focus of infection, e.g., osteomyelitis, MPPT removed the soft tissue infection in approx. 2.5 months and supported regeneration, considerably reducing fistula sizes. Compared to standard care, per-wound cost savings were 51 to 94% depending on wound grade and age, and substantial nursing resources were freed up. The telemedicine approach was well received by participants and supported independence and self-care. The use of antimicrobials, plastics, and synthetic polymers was essentially eliminated. MPPT did not require bed rest. Conclusion: The study confirmed that MPPT is safe and effective in treating acute and chronic wounds in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, including wounds with antimicrobial-resistant infections. MPPT also removes soft tissue infections caused by an underlying primary focus of infection, such as osteomyelitis. Non-healing wounds currently represent an unmet clinical need. The findings suggest that a therapy acting via the microbiome without antimicrobial actions is effective.","Sams-Dodd J., Belci M., Bandi S., Smith D., Sams-Dodd F.",10.3389/fmed.2023.1279100,Frontiers In Medicine
Impact Of Plastic Particles On The Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes To Bacterium: Dependent On Particle Sizes And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Vector Replication Capacities,"Plastic particles impact the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environmental media, and their perturbation on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs is recognized as a critical influencing mechanism. However, studies concerning the influence and influencing mechanisms of plastic particles on the HGT of ARGs were limited, particularly for the effect of particle sizes and ARG vector-associated mechanisms. This study explored the impact of polystyrene (PS) particles with sizes of 75, 90, 100, 1000, and 10000 nm on the HGT (via transformation) of ARGs mediated by pUC19, pSTV29, and pBR322 plasmids into Escherichia coli cells. PS particles with sizes ≤100 nm impacted the transformation of ARGs, but large particles (1000 and 10000 nm) showed no obvious effects. Effects of PS particles on the transfer of three plasmids were vastly distinct. For pUC19 with high replication capacities, the transfer was monotonously promoted. However, for pSTV29 and pBR322 with low replication capacities, suppressing effects were observed. This was attributed to two competing mechanisms. The enhancing mechanism was that the direct interaction of PS particles with membrane lipids and the indirect effect associated with bacterial oxidative stress response induced pore formation on the cell membrane and increased membrane permeability, thus enhancing plasmid entrance. The inhibiting mechanism was that PS particles interfered with plasmid replication inside E. coli, thus decreasing the bacterial tranformation. This study deepened our understanding of the environmental dissemination of ARGs in plastic contamination.","Hu X., Waigi M.G., Yang B., Gao Y.",10.1021/acs.est.2c00745,Environmental Science And Technology
Accumulation Of Antibiotics In The Environment: Have Appropriate Measures Been Taken To Protect Canadian Human And Ecological Health?,"In Canada, every day, contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) are discharged from waste treatment facilities into freshwaters. CECs such as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal care products (PCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and microplastics are legally discharged from sewage treatment plants (STPs), water reclamation plants (WRPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs), or other forms of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). In 2006, the Government of Canada established the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) to classify chemicals based on a risk-priority assessment, which ranked many CECs such as PhACs as being of low urgency, therefore permitting these substances to continue being released into the environment at unmonitored rates. The problem with ranking PhACs as a low priority is that CMP's risk management assessment overlooks the long-term environmental and synergistic effects of PhAC accumulation, such as the long-term risk of antibiotic CEC accumulation in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The goal of this review is to specifically investigate antibiotic CEC accumulation and associated environmental risks to human and environmental health, as well as to determine whether appropriate legislative strategies are in place within Canada's governance framework. In this research, secondary data on antibiotic CEC levels in Canadian and international wastewaters, their potential to promote antibiotic-resistant residues, associated environmental short- and long-term risks, and synergistic effects were all considered. Unlike similar past reviews, this review employed an interdisciplinary approach to propose new strategies from the perspectives of science, engineering, and law.","Aladekoyi O., Siddiqui S., Hania P., Hamza R., Gilbride K.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116513,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Urban Waste Piles Are Reservoirs For Human Pathogenic Bacteria With High Levels Of Multidrug Resistance Against Last Resort Antibiotics: A Comprehensive Temporal And Geographic Field Analysis,"Inadequate waste management and poor sanitation practices in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) leads to waste accumulation in urban and peri-urban residential areas. This increases human exposure to hazardous waste, including plastics, which can harbour pathogenic bacteria. Although lab-based studies demonstrate how plastic pollution can increase the persistence and dissemination of dangerous pathogens, empirical data on pathogen association with plastic in real-world settings are limited. We conducted a year-long spatiotemporal sampling survey in a densely populated informal settlement in Malawi, quantifying enteric bacterial pathogens including ESBL-producing E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio cholerae. Culture-based screening and molecular approaches were used to quantify the presence of each pathogen, together with the distribution and frequency of resistance to antibiotics. Our data indicate that these pathogens commonly associate with urban waste materials. Elevated levels of these pathogens precede typical infection outbreaks, suggesting that urban waste piles may be an important source of community transmission. Notably, many pathogens displayed increased levels of AMR, including against several ‘last resort’ antibiotics. These findings highlight urban waste piles as potential hotspots for the dissemination of infectious diseases and AMR and underscores the need for urgent waste management interventions to mitigate public health risks.","Mphasa M., Ormsby M.J., Mwapasa T., Nambala P., Chidziwisano K., Morse T., Feasey N., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136639,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Evidence Of Interspecific Plasmid Uptake By Pathogenic Strains Of Klebsiella Isolated From Microplastic Pollution On Public Beaches,"Microplastic beads are becoming a common feature on beaches, and there is increasing evidence that such microplastics can become colonised by potential human pathogens. However, whether the concentrations and pathogenicity of these pathogens pose a public health risk are still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine realistic environmental concentrations of potential pathogens colonising microplastic beads, and quantify the expression of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Microplastic beads were collected from beaches and a culture-dependent approach was used to determine the concentrations of seven target bacteria (Campylobacter spp.; E. coli; intestinal enterococci; Klebsiella spp.; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Salmonella spp.; Vibrio spp.). All seven target bacteria were detected without the need for a pre-enrichment step; urban sites had higher bacterial concentrations, whilst polymer type had no influence on bacterial concentrations. Klebsiella was the most abundant target bacteria and possessed virulence and ARGs, some of which were present on plasmids from other species, and showed pathogenicity in a Galleria melonella infection model. Our findings demonstrate how pathogen colonised microplastic beads can pose a heightened public health risk at the beach, and highlights the urgency for improved monitoring and enforcement of regulations on the release of microplastics into the environment.","Metcalf R., Messer L.F., White H.L., Ormsby M.J., Matallana-Surget S., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132567,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Impact Of The Surrounding Environment On Antibiotic Resistance Genes Carried By Microplastics In Mangroves,"The pollution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) carried by microplastics (MPs) is a growing concern. Mangroves are located at the intersection of land and sea and are seriously affected by MP pollution. However, few studies have systematic research evaluating the transmission risk of ARGs carried by MPs in mangroves. We conducted in situ experiments by burying five different MPs (polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, polystyrene, polyethylene glycol terephthalate, and polycaprolactone particles) in mangroves with different surrounding environments. A total of 10 genes in the MPs of mangroves were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, including eight ARGs and two mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The abundance of ARGs in Guanhai park mangroves in living areas (GH) was higher than that of Gaoqiao mangroves in protected areas (GQ) and Beiyue dike mangroves in aquaculture pond areas (BY). Pathogenic bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Vibrio were found on the MP surfaces of the mangroves. The number of ARGs carried by multiple drug-resistant bacteria in the GH mangroves was greater than that in the GQ and BY mangroves. Moreover, the ARGs carried by MPs in GH mangroves had the highest potential transmission risk by horizontal gene transfer. Sociometric and environmental factors were the main drivers shaping the distribution characteristics of ARGs and MGEs. Polypropylene and high-density polyethylene particles are preferred substrates for obtaining diffuse ARGs. This study investigated the drivers of ARGs in the MPs of mangroves and provided essential guidance on the use and handling of plastics.","Sun R., He L., Li T., Dai Z., Sun S., Ren L., Liang Y.-Q., Zhang Y., Li C.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155771,Science Of The Total Environment
Exposure To Bisphenol Compounds Accelerates The Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmid,"Antimicrobial resistance poses the most formidable challenge to public health, with plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer playing a pivotal role in its global spread. Bisphenol compounds (BPs), a group of environmental contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties, are extensively used in various plastic products and can be transmitted to food. However, the impact of BPs on the plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not yet been elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate that BPs could promote the conjugative transfer frequency of RP4-7 and clinically multidrug-resistant plasmids. Furthermore, the promoting effect of BPs on the plasmid transfer was also confirmed in a murine model. Microbial diversity analysis of transconjugants indicated an increase in α diversity in the BPAF-treated group, along with the declined richness of some beneficial bacteria and elevated richness of Faecalibaculum rodentium, which might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. The underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced conjugative transfer upon BPAF treatment include exacerbated oxidative stress, disrupted membrane homeostasis, augmented energy metabolism, and the increased expression of conjugation-related genes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential risk associated with the exacerbated dissemination of AMR both in vitro and in vivo caused by BPs exposure.","Yang B., Sun J., Zhu S., Wang Z., Liu Y.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120002,Environmental Research
Cutibacterium Acnes Phylogenetic Type Ic And Ii Isolated From Patients With Non-Acne Diseases Exhibit High-Level Biofilm Formation,"Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes is an important for not only exacerbating factor of acne vulgaris but also pathogen of surgical site infections (SSIs) in orthopedics and plastic surgery. Although biofilm-forming (BF) C. acnes are associated with intractable SSI, characteristics of these strains were still unknown. Here, we explored detailed molecular epidemiological features of BF C. acnes isolated as causative pathogen of infectious diseases. Phylogenetic types of 205 C. acnes strains isolated between 2013 and 2018 from 18 clinical departments of a university hospital in Japan were determined by single-locus sequence type (SLST). Clade H (traditional type IC) and K (type II) which are less relevant with healthy skin and acne vulgaris, were detected in 26.8% (55/205) and 16.1% (33/205) of the strains, respectively. The incidence of them was significantly higher than that of acne patients (H and K, each 2.9%, P < 0.05). In addition, SLST distribution of C. acnes strains differed by each department and isolation site. When biofilm formation was quantified, 51 strains (24.9%) were defined as high-BF strains. Notably, most high-BF strains were classified into the strains of clade H (56.4%, 31/55) and clade K (54.4%, 18/33), and these strains were frequently found in the strains isolated from patients of medical emergency center and plastic surgery. Similarly, high-BF strains were frequently found among the isolates from blood (35.7%) and catheters (30.0%), with a high proportion belonging to clades H and K. Compared to C. acnes strains isolated from acne patients, antimicrobial-resistant strains were less identified in non-acne patients. Our findings showed that pathogenicity of C. acnes strains differs by their phylogenetic types. Furthermore, we showed clade H and K have the ability of high biofilm formation and suggest that these strains have potential to become a risk factor for SSI.","Nakase K., Koizumi J., Midorikawa R., Yamasaki K., Tsutsui M., Aoki S., Nasu Y., Hirai Y., Nakaminami H., Noguchi N.",10.1016/j.ijmm.2021.151538,International Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Combined Effects Of Micro-/Nano-Plastics And Oxytetracycline On The Intestinal Histopathology And Microbiome In Zebrafish (Danio Rerio),"Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that microplastics and oxytetracycline (OTC) affect organisms, but few studies have investigated their combined effects on aquatic organisms. In this study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to single and binary-combined contamination of micro-, nano-sized polystyrene plastics and OTC for 30 days, and the intestinal histopathology, gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of zebrafish were measured. The results showed that the intestinal epithelial damage increase with the decrease of plastic sizes. Nano-sized plastics, OTC and their combined exposure caused intestinal epithelial damage, and co-exposure with micro-sized plastics reduced the intestinal damage caused by single OTC exposure. The gut microbial communities were affected by the combined exposure to microplastics and OTC. Compared with the blank control, the relative abundance of Fusobacteria increased 12.7 % and 21.1 % in OTC combined with 45–85 μm micro-plastics (MOTC) and 40–54 nm nano-plastics (NOTC), respectively, and that of Bacteroidetes increased 26.2 % and 18.6 % in the MOTC and NOTC treatments, respectively. The effects of MOTC and NOTC on the biodiversity of the zebrafish gut microbiome were different; MOTC increased the biodiversity by 11.3 % compared with the blank control, whereas NOTC decreased the biodiversity by 8.8 % compared with the blank control. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in 40–54 nm nano-plastics, MOTC and NOTC treatments was increased 96.9 %, 96.6 % and 68.8 % compared with the control group, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were observed in ARGs characteristics between the micro- and nano-plastics treated groups whether combined with OTC or not. These results are essential to further understand the combined ecotoxicological effects of micro- or nano-plastics and antibiotics on aquatic organisms.","Yu Z., Zhang L., Huang Q., Dong S., Wang X., Yan C.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156917,Science Of The Total Environment
"The Responses Of Microbial Metabolic Activity, Bacterial Community And Resistance Genes Under The Coexistence Of Nanoplastics And Quaternary Ammonium Compounds In The Sewage Environment","Nanoplastics (NPs) and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are frequently detected in sewage. However, little is known about the risks of coexistence of NPs and QACs. In this study, the responses of microbial metabolic activity, bacterial community and resistance genes (RGs) to the exposure of polyethylene (PE), polylactic acid (PLA), silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) and dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) were focused on 2nd and 30th day of incubation in sewer environment. Bacterial community contributed 25.01 % to shape RGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) after two days of incubation in sewage and plastisphere. After 30 days of incubation, the most important individual factor (35.82 %) was turned to microbial metabolic activity. The metabolic capacity of the microbial communities in plastisphere was stronger than that from SiO(2) samples. Moreover, DDBAC inhibited the metabolic capacity of microorganisms in sewage samples, and increased the absolute abundances of 16S rRNA in plastisphere and sewage samples which might be similar to the hormesis effect. After 30 days of incubation, Aquabacterium was the predominant genus in plastisphere. As for SiO(2) samples, Brevundimonas was the predominant genus. QACs RGs (qacEdelta1-01, qacEdelta1-02) and antibiotic RGs (ARGs) (aac(6′)-Ib, tetG-1) significantly enriched in plastisphere. There was also co-selection among qacEdelta1-01, qacEdelta1-02 and ARGs. In addition, VadinBC27 which enriched in plastisphere of PLA NPs was positively correlated with the potentially disease-causing genus Pseudomonas. It showed that after 30 days of incubation, plastisphere had an important effect on distribution and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and RGs. Plastisphere of PLA NPs also carried the risk of spreading disease.","Zhang Y., Gao J., Wang Z., Zhao Y., Liu Y., Zhang H., Zhao M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163064,Science Of The Total Environment
Microbial Colonizers Of Microplastics In An Arctic Freshwater Lake,"Microplastics (MPs) have been found everywhere as they are easily transported between environmental compartments. Through their transport, MPs are quickly colonized by microorganisms; this microbial community is known as the plastisphere. Here, we characterized the plastisphere of three MPs, one biodegradable (PHB) and two non-biodegradables (HDPE and LDPE), deployed in an Arctic freshwater lake for eleven days. The plastisphere was found to be complex, confirming that about a third of microbial colonizers were viable. Plastisphere was compared to microbial communities on the surrounding water and microbial mats on rocks at the bottom of the lake. Microbial mats followed by MPs showed the highest diversity regarding both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as compared to water samples; however, for fungi, MPs showed the highest diversity of the tested substrates. Significant differences on microbial assemblages on the three tested substrates were found; regarding microbial assemblages on MPs, bacterial genera found in polar environments such as Mycoplana, Erythromicrobium and Rhodoferax with species able to metabolize recalcitrant chemicals were abundant. Eukaryotic communities on MPs were characterized by the presence of ciliates of the genera Stentor, Vorticella and Uroleptus and the algae Cryptomonas, Chlamydomonas, Tetraselmis and Epipyxis. These ciliates normally feed on algae so that the complexity of these assemblages may serve to unravel trophic relationships between co-existing taxa. Regarding fungal communities on MPs, the most abundant genera were Betamyces, Cryptococcus, Arrhenia and Paranamyces. MPs, particularly HDPE, were enriched in the sulI and ermB antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which may raise concerns about human health–related issues as ARGs may be transferred horizontally between bacteria. This study highlights the importance of proper waste management and clean-up protocols to protect the environmental health of pristine environments such as polar regions in a context of global dissemination of MPs which may co-transport microorganisms, some of them including ARGs.","González-Pleiter M., Velázquez D., Casero M.C., Tytgat B., Verleyen E., Leganés F., Rosal R., Quesada A., Fernández-Piñas F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148640,Science Of The Total Environment
Microplastisphere Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Bird'S-Eye View On The Plastic-Specific Diversity And Enrichment,"The microplastisphere is a dense consortium of metabolically active microorganisms that develops on the surface of microplastics. Since the discovery that it harbors antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), there has been a quest to decipher the relationship between ARG occurrences and selective enrichment with plastic types, which is important to understand their fate in diverse environmental settings. Nonetheless, it remains a neglected topic, and this developing field of microplastics research could benefit from a comprehensive review to acquire a deeper understanding of the most recent advances and drive scientific progress. Accordingly, the goal of this review is to critically discuss and provide an in-depth assessment of the evidence of ARGs' global nature in microplastispheres, as well as explore factors that influence them directly and indirectly, highlighting important concerns and knowledge gaps throughout the article. By comprehensively covering them, we underscore the potential environmental implications associated with microplastisphere ARGs. From our analysis, it emerged that microplastisphere ARGs are likely to be impacted not only by differences in microplastic types and characteristics but also by how their environments are shaped by other agents such as physiochemical properties, socioeconomic factors, and contaminants coexistence, influencing ARG subtype, incidence, abundance, and selective enrichment. The intricate relationship of microplastisphere ARGs to environmental conditions and plastic types calls for multilevel investigations to clearly assess the environmental fate of microplastics. We anticipate that this review could assist researchers in strengthening their foundation and identifying efforts to advance knowledge in this research field.","Shruti V.C., Kutralam-Muniasamy G., Pérez-Guevara F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169316,Science Of The Total Environment
Isolation And Characterization Of A Novel Myophage Abp9 Against Pandrug Resistant Acinetobacater Baumannii,"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens in health care institutions. A. baumannii can cause a wide range of diseases in humans, including pneumonia and septicemia. Phage therapy has drawn great interest from medical researchers as a potential way to control infections by antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii. Using a pandrug-resistant clinical A. baumannii isolate AB(ZY)9 as an indicator, we isolated a lytic phage Abp9 from hospital sewage. Abp9 belongs to myoviridae family and shows a wider host range of 12%. Abp9 contains a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 44,820 bp with a G + C content of 37.69%. The Abp9 genome contains 80 open reading frames, but lacks any known virulence genes or lysogen-formation genes. In a systemic A. baumannii infection mouse models, Abp9 treatment showed good therapeutic effects. We have also observed an excellent lytic activity against A. baumannii in biofilm form of growth in vitro. All of these suggest that Abp9 is a good candidate for the phage therapy against drug-resistant A. baumannii infections.","Jiang L., Tan J., Hao Y., Wang Q., Yan X., Wang D., Tuo L., Wei Z., Huang G.",10.3389/fmicb.2020.506068,Frontiers In Microbiology
Analysis And Management Of Pathogens Isolated From Patients With Complicated Facial Lacerations And Abrasions,"Plastic surgeons commonly encounter patients with facial lacerations and/or abrasions in the emergency room. If they are properly treated, facial wounds generally heal well without complications. However, infection can sometimes cause delayed wound healing. We performed wound culture for the early detection of infection and to promote the healing of infected facial wounds. We included 5033 patients with facial wounds who visited the emergency room of Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital between January 2018 and February 2021. Among them, 104 patients underwent wound culture. We analysed the pathogens isolated and the patients' age, sex, wound site, mechanism of injury, wound healing time, time from injury to culture, time to culture results, and dressing methods used. Pathogens were isolated in slightly less than half of the patients (38.46%); among them, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common (47.5%). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated in six (15%) patients. Patients with complicated wounds had a longer mean wound healing time (10.83 ± 5.91 days) than those with non-complicated wounds (6.06 ± 1.68 days). Wound culture of complicated facial wounds resulted in the isolation of various types of pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi. We recommend the use of wound culture for early detection of infection to prevent delayed wound healing.","Shin S.H., Woo S.S., Lee J.H., Kim H.J., Kim S.H., Kim J.H., Suh I.S.",10.1111/iwj.13842,International Wound Journal
Microplastics Enrichment Characteristics Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens In Landfill Leachate,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a pressing environmental issue for aquatic ecosystems. Landfill leachate is an important contributor of MPs and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). However, there are few studies on the colonization of ARGs and pathogens on MPs in leachate. This study conducted incubation experiments with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) MPs in landfill leachate which were about 3–5 years old (PL) and 5–10 years old (AL). After incubation, the bacterial cells colonized and grew on the surface of MPs, inducing the increase of oxygenated oxygen functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) on the MPs surface. Real-time PCR indicated that MPs selectively enriched ARGs, such as genes tetM, tetC, mcr-1, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, blaTEM and blaSHV in leachate. The diversity of bacterial communities on MPs was significantly increased in AL leachate, but decreased in PL leachate. The differences in bacterial communities in MPs biofilms were related to the type of MPs. Compared with AL leachate, the abundance of Chloroflexi increased by 15.7% on the PET, and the abundance of Acidobacteriota increased by 6.23 fold on the PP. The abundance of Firmicutes increased from 20.7% in PL leachate to 65.8% and 60.7% on PET and PP, respectively. Additionally, pathogens were observed to be more abundant on MPs compared to leachate. In particular, pathogens (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterobacter and Rhodococcus) associated with sul1 and sul2 were generally present at higher levels on MPs than in the surrounding leachate. These results provide significant implications for understanding the health risk of MPs in the environment.","Qiu C., Zhou Y., Wang H., Chu Y., Zheng L., Chen Y., Song Y., Fang C.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140100,Chemosphere
Bacteriophage Treatment Before Chemical Disinfection Can Enhance Removal Of Plastic-Surface-Associated Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Opportunistic pathogens can linger on surfaces in hospital and building plumbing environments, leading to infections in at-risk populations. Furthermore, biofilm-associated bacteria are protected from removal and inactivation protocols such as disinfection. Bacteriophages show promise as tools to treat antibiotic-resistant infections. As such, phages may also be useful in environmental applications to prevent newly acquired infections. In the current study, the potential of synergies between bacteriophage and chemical disinfection against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed under various conditions. Specifically, surface-associated P. aeruginosa was treated with various concentrations of phages (P1 or JG004), chemical disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite or benzalkonium chloride), or combined sequential treatments under three distinct attachment models (spot inoculations, dry biofilms, and wet biofilms). Phages were very effective at removing bacteria in spot inoculations (>3.2 log10 removal) and wet biofilms (up to 2.6 log10 removal), while phages prevented the regrowth of dry biofilms in the application time. In addition, phage treatment followed by chemical disinfection inactivated P. aeruginosa cells under wet biofilm conditions better than either treatment alone. This effect was hindered when chemical disinfection was applied first, followed by phage treatment, suggesting that the additive benefits of combination treatments are lost when phage is applied last. Furthermore, we confirm previous evidence of greater phage tolerance to benzalkonium chloride than to sodium hypochlorite, informing choices for combination phage-disinfectant approaches. Overall, this paper further supports the potential of using combination phage and chemical disinfectant treatments to improve the inactivation of surface-associated P. aeruginosa. IMPORTANCE Phages are already utilized in the health care industry to treat antibiotic-resistant infections, such as those on implant-associated biofilms and in compassionate-care cases. Phage treatment could also be a promising new tool to control pathogens in the built environment, preventing infections from occurring. This study shows that phages can be combined effectively with chemical disinfectants to improve the removal of wet biofilms and bacteria spotted onto surfaces while preventing regrowth in dry biofilms. This has the potential to improve pathogen containment within the built environment and drinking water infrastructure to prevent infections by opportunistic pathogens.","Stachler E., Kull A., Julian T.R.",10.1128/AEM.00980-21,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Bacterial Community Succession And The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In An Oyster Farm,"Microplastics can be colonized by microorganisms and form plastisphere. However, knowledge of bacterial community succession and the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens on microplastics in aquaculture environments is limited. Here, we conducted a 30-day continuous exposure experiment at an oyster farm. Results showed that the alpha-diversity of communities on most microplastics continuously increased and was higher than in planktonic communities after 14 days. Microplastics could selectively enrich certain bacteria from water which can live a sessile lifestyle and promote colonization by other bacteria. The composition and function of plastisphere communities were distinct from those in the surrounding water and influenced by polymer type and exposure time. Microplastics can enrich ARGs (sul1, qnrS and bla(TEM)) and harbor potential pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Therefore, microplastic pollution may pose a critical threat to aquaculture ecosystems and human health. Our study provides further insight into the ecological risks of microplastics.","Xiao S., Zhang Y., Wu Y., Li J., Dai W., Pang K., Liu Y., Wu R.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115402,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Phage Therapy Combined With Gum Karaya Injectable Hydrogels For Treatment Of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Deep Wound Infection In A Porcine Model,"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) represent a significant healthcare challenge, particularly in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance. This study investigates the efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach combining bacteriophage (phage) therapy with a gum Karaya (GK)-based hydrogel delivery system in a porcine model of deep staphylococcal SSTIs. The study exploits the lytic activity and safety of the Staphylococcus phage 812K1/420 of the Kayvirus genus, which is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The GK injectable hydrogels and hydrogel films, developed by our research group, serve as effective, non-toxic, and easy-to-apply delivery systems, supporting moist wound healing and re-epithelialization. In the porcine model, the combined treatment showed a synergistic effect, leading to a significant reduction in bacterial load (2.5 log CFU/gram of tissue) within one week. Local signs of inflammation were significantly reduced by day 8, with clear evidence of re-epithelialization and wound contraction. Importantly, no adverse effects of the GK-based delivery system were observed throughout the study. The results highlight the potential of this innovative therapeutic approach to effectively treat deep staphylococcal SSTIs, providing a promising avenue for further research and clinical application in the field of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Vacek L., Polaštík Kleknerová D., Lipový B., Holoubek J., Matysková D., Černá E., Brtníková J., Jeklová E., Kobzová Š., Janda L., Lišková L., Diabelko D., Botka T., Pantůček R., Růžička F., Vojtová L.",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2024.124348,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics
Large-Scale Patterns Of Soil Antibiotic Resistome In Chinese Croplands,"Soil is a vital reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but we still know little about their distribution in cropland soils and the main driving forces. Here we performed an investigation for ARGs patterns in 105 cropland soils (planted with maize, peanut or soybean) along a 2, 200 km transect in China using high-throughput quantitative PCR approaches. Totally, 204 ARGs were detected, with a higher diversity found in central China than that in northeast and south China. The most abundant (top 50%) and highly shared (present in >50% samples) ARGs regarded as core resistome were dominated by multidrug resistance genes such as oprJ, acrA-05 and acrA-04. Regressive analyses revealed that the relative abundance of total ARGs and core resistome both had significant relationships with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Anthropogenic factors including the consumption of plastic films and soil properties including heavy metals showed good correlations with the diversity of ARGs. Structural equation modelling analysis further explained that anthropogenic factors were the main forces shaping the ARGs patterns. These findings highlight the importance of human activities in shaping soil antibiotic resistome in the croplands, providing potential management strategies to mitigate the dissemination of ARGs to humans via food chain.","Du S., Shen J.-P., Hu H.-W., Wang J.-T., Han L.-L., Sheng R., Wei W.-X., Fang Y.-T., Zhu Y.-G., Zhang L.-M., He J.-Z.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136418,Science Of The Total Environment
Bacterial Colonisation Dynamics Of Household Plastics In A Coastal Environment,"Accumulation of plastics in the marine environment has widespread detrimental consequences for ecosystems and wildlife. Marine plastics are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including human pathogens, posing potential risks to health. Here, we investigate the effect of polymer type, residence time and estuarine location on bacterial colonisation of common household plastics, including pathogenic bacteria. We submerged five main household plastic types: low-density PE (LDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at an estuarine site in Cornwall (U.K.) and tracked bacterial colonisation dynamics. Using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, we found that bacteria rapidly colonised plastics irrespective of polymer type, reaching culturable densities of up to 1000 cells cm(3) after 7 weeks. Community composition of the biofilms changed over time, but not among polymer types. The presence of pathogenic bacteria, quantified using the insect model Galleria mellonella, increased dramatically over a five-week period, with Galleria mortality increasing from 4% in week one to 65% in week five. No consistent differences in virulence were observed between polymer types. Pathogens isolated from plastic biofilms using Galleria enrichment included Serratia and Enterococcus species and they harboured a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings show that plastics in coastal waters are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria independent of polymer type. Further, our results show that marine plastic biofilms become increasingly associated with virulent bacteria over time.","Lear L., Padfield D., Dowsett T., Jones M., Kay S., Hayward A., Vos M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156199,Science Of The Total Environment
Use Of Antibiotic Beads To Salvage Infected Breast Implants,"Purpose When an implant becomes infected, implant salvage is often performed where the implant is removed, capsulectomy is performed, and a new implant is inserted. The patient is discharged with a PICC line and 6–8 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This method has variable success and subjects the patient to long-term systemic antibiotics. In the 1960s, the use of antibiotic-impregnated beads for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was described. These beads deliver antibiotic directly to the site of the infection, thereby eliminating the complications of systemic IV antibiotics. This study aimed to present a case series illustrating the use of STIMULAN calcium sulfate beads loaded with vancomycin and tobramycin to increase the rate of salvage of the infected implant and forgo IV antibiotics. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who were treated at Mount Sinai Hospital for implant infection with salvage and antibiotic beads. Results Twelve patients were identified, 10 of whom had breast cancer. Comorbidities included hypertension, smoking, and immunocompromised status. Infections were noted anywhere from 5 days to 8 years postoperatively. Salvage was successful in 9 out of the 12 infected implants using antibiotic bead therapy without home IV antibiotics. Conclusions The use of antibiotic beads is promising for salvaging infected breast implants without IV antibiotics. Seventy-five percent of the implants were successfully salvaged. Of the three patients who had unsalvageable implants, one was infected with antibiotic-resistant Rhodococcus that was refractory to bead therapy and one was noncompliant with postoperative instructions.","Sherif R.D., Ingargiola M., Sanati-Mehrizy P., Torina P.J., Harmaty M.A.",10.1016/j.bjps.2017.05.023,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"

Here, we developed a cotton fabric coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs), which possessed hydrophobic, antimicrobial, and anti-biofilm properties. Once the graphene oxide was dip-coated on a cellulose cotton fabric, Cu NPs were synthesized using a chemical reduction method to fabricate an rGO/Cu fabric, which was analyzed through FE-SEM, EDS, and ICP-MS. The results of our colony-forming unit assays indicated that the rGO/Cu fabric possessed high antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium xerosis, and Micrococcus luteus. Particularly, the fabric could inhibit the growth of E. coli, C. xerosis, and M. luteus with a 99% efficiency. Furthermore, our findings confirmed that the same concentrations of rGO/Cu had no cytotoxic effects against CCD-986Sk and Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF), human skin cells, and NIH/3T3, a mouse skin cell. The developed rGO/Cu fabric thus exhibited promising applicability as a cotton material that can maintain hygienic conditions by preventing the propagation of various bacteria and sufficiently suppressing biofilm formation while also being harmless to the human body.","Kim J., Kang S.H., Choi Y., Lee W., Kim N., Tanaka M., Kang S.H., Choi J.",10.1038/s41598-023-38723-4,Scientific Reports
Alteration Of Microbial Mediated Carbon Cycle And Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Plastisphere Formation In Coastal Area,"Microorganisms can attach on the surface of microplastics (MPs) through biological fouling process to form a diverse community called the ""plastisphere"", which has attracted extensive attention. Although the microbial structure and composition of biofilm have been studied, the knowledge of its microbial function and ecological risk is still limited. In this study, we investigated how the surface properties of MPs affect the biofilm communities and metabolic features under different environmental conditions, and explored the biofilm enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results showed that the incubation time, habitat and MPs aging state significantly influenced the structure and composition of biofilm microbial communities, and a small amount of pathogens have been found in the MPs-attached biofilm. The microbial carbon utilization capacity of the biofilm in different incubation habitats varies greatly with highest metabolism capacity appear in the river. The utilization efficiency of different carbon sources is polymer > carbohydrate > amino acid > carboxylic acids > amine/amide, which indicates that the biofilm communities have selectivity between different types of carbon sources. More importantly, ARGs were detected in all the MPs samples and showed a trend of estuary > river > marine. The aged MPs can accumulate more ARGs than the virgin items. In general, MPs in the aquatic environment may become a carrier for pathogens and ARGs to spread to other environment, which may enhance their potential risks to the ecosystem and human health.","Shan E., Zhang X., Li J., Sun C., Teng J., Hou C., Zhao J., Sun S., Wang Q.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140420,Chemosphere
Comprehensive Profiling And Risk Assessment Of Antibiotic Resistomes In Surface Water And Plastisphere By Integrated Shotgun Metagenomics,"The ever-increasing microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic ecosystems has become a serious global challenging issue. However, the impact of different pollution sources on microbiome and antibiotic resistome in surface water (SW) and plastisphere (PS) remains largely elusive. Here, shotgun metagenomics was used to analyze microbiome structure and antibiotic resistome in SW and PS under the influence of different pollution sources. Pseudomonas were the most abundant genus, followed by Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, Acidovorax, and Limnohabitans. However, their relative abundance varied significantly both across the sampling sites and habitats i.e. SW and PS (p < 0.05). Additionally, various ARGs were detected in SW and PS, with PS (372) having significantly more potential ARGs than SW (293). The results further showed significant variations in the relative abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria across the sampling sites and habitats (p < 0.05). Further moreover, significant differences were observed in antibiotic resistome risk scores, ARGs and MGEs across different habitats. Over all, this study suggests that pollution source and water quality parameters had a significant impact on microbiome composition and antibiotic resistome in SW and PS.","Malla M.A., Nomalihle M., Featherston J., Kumar A., Amoah I.D., Ismail A., Bux F., Kumari S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.137180,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Plastisphere In Lake Waters: Microbial Diversity, Biofilm Structure, And Potential Implications For Freshwater Ecosystems","Once dispersed in water, microplastic (MP) particles are rapidly colonised by aquatic microbes, which can adhere and grow onto solid surfaces in the form of biofilms. This study provides new insights on microbial diversity and biofilm structure of plastisphere in lake waters. By combining Fourier Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing, we investigated the microbial colonization patterns on floating MPs and, for the first time, the occurrence of eukaryotic core members and their possible relations with biofilm-forming bacterial taxa within the plastisphere of four different lakes. Through PCR-based methods (qPCR, LAMP-PCR), we also evaluated the role of lake plastisphere as long-term dispersal vectors of potentially harmful organisms (including pathogens) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in freshwater ecosystems. Consistent variation patterns of the microbial community composition occurred between water and among the plastisphere samples of the different lakes. The eukaryotic core microbiome was mainly composed by typical freshwater biofilm colonizers, such as diatoms (Pennales, Bacillariophyceaea) and green algae (Chlorophyceae), which interact with eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes of different trophic levels. Results also showed that MPs are suitable vectors of biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogens and a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer, likely facilitating antibiotic resistance spread in the environments.","Di Pippo F., Crognale S., Levantesi C., Vitanza L., Sighicelli M., Pietrelli L., Di Vito S., Amalfitano S., Rossetti S.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119876,Environmental Pollution
Absence Of Synergistic Effects Between Microplastics And Copper Ions On The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Within Aquatic Bacteria At The Community Level,"Microplastics and copper ions (Cu(2+)) are favorable in accelerating the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the plastisphere, however, their combined effects on the ARG spread within the bacterial community of the natural environment were less understood. The influence of microplastic types and Cu(2+) concentrations on the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs mediated by RP4 plasmid within natural bacterial communities in aquatic environments was investigated. Both biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS) and non-biodegradable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics significantly enhanced the transfer of ARGs, with PBS showing a significant higher effect compared to PVC. Cu(2+) also increased transconjugation rates at environmentally relevant concentrations (5 μg L(−1)), but higher levels (50 μg L(−1)) lead to decreased rates due to severe bacterial cell membrane damage. The transconjugation rates in the presence of both microplastics and Cu(2+) were lower than the sum of their individual effects, indicating no synergistic effects between them on transconjugation. Proteobacteria dominated the composition of transconjugates for all the treatment. Transmission electron microscope images and reactive oxygen species production in bacterial cells indicated that the increased contact frequency due to extracellular polymeric substances, combined with enhanced membrane permeability induced by microplastics and Cu(2+), accounted for the increasing transconjugation rates. The study provides valuable insight into the potential effects of microplastics and heavy metals on the spread of ARGs from donors to bacterial communities in natural environments.","Lin L., Sun M., Pan X., Zhang W., Yang Y., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176591,Science Of The Total Environment
Characterizing Infections In Prosthetic Breast Reconstruction: A Validity Assessment Of National Health Databases,"Introduction Current guidelines in the United States require reporting only the 30-day postoperative outcomes to standardized databases, including the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Thus, many breast implant-related complications go unreported in standard databases. We sought to characterize late periprosthetic infections following implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all women who underwent expander/implant reconstruction from 2005 to 2014 at two institutions. All periprosthetic infections were identified and divided into early and late cohorts (≤30 days or >30 days). Infection was defined as any episode where antibiotics were initiated or a prosthetic device was explanted because of clinical evidence of the infection. Results In the 1820 patients (2980 breasts) identified, 421 periprosthetic infections occurred (14%). Of these, 173 (41%) were early and 248 (59%) were late (mean time to infection = 66.4 ± 101.9 days). Patients with late infections were more likely to be current smokers or have diabetes than patients with early infections (p < 0.034 for both). Infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and antimicrobial-resistant strains of Staphylococcus were more common in the early infection group (p < 0.001 for both). Implant loss due to infection was more common in the late infection group (p = 0.037). Discussion Late periprosthetic infections following implant-based breast reconstruction are underestimated in national outcome databases and have unique risk factors and microbiology compared to early infections. A system-level change in reevaluating and redefining a timeline for tracking and treating implant infections is necessary, given the substantial morbidity associated with, and frequency of, late periprosthetic infections.","Piper M.L., Roussel L.O., Koltz P.F., Wang F., Singh K., Chin R., Sbitany H., Langstein H.N.",10.1016/j.bjps.2017.05.004,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
"Freshwater Plastisphere: A Review On Biodiversity, Risks, And Biodegradation Potential With Implications For The Aquatic Ecosystem Health","The plastisphere, a unique microbial biofilm community colonizing plastic debris and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments, has attracted increasing attention owing to its ecological and public health implications. This review consolidates current state of knowledge on freshwater plastisphere, focussing on its biodiversity, community assembly, and interactions with environmental factors. Current biomolecular approaches revealed a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa associated with plastic surfaces. Despite their ecological importance, the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and mobile genetic elements (i.e., antibiotic resistance genes) raises concerns for ecosystem and human health. However, the extent of these risks and their implications remain unclear. Advanced sequencing technologies are promising for elucidating the functions of plastisphere, particularly in plastic biodegradation processes. Overall, this review emphasizes the need for comprehensive studies to understand plastisphere dynamics in freshwater and to support effective management strategies to mitigate the impact of plastic pollution on freshwater resources.","Bocci V., Galafassi S., Levantesi C., Crognale S., Amalfitano S., Congestri R., Matturro B., Rossetti S., Di Pippo F.",10.3389/fmicb.2024.1395401,Frontiers In Microbiology

Antimicrobial Poly(Ionic Liquid)-Induced Bacterial Nanotube Formation And Drug-Resistance Spread,"Bacterial nanotubes are tubular membranous structures bulging from the cell surface that can connect neighboring bacteria for the exchange of intercellular substances. However, little is known about the formation and function of bacterial nanotubes under the stress of antimicrobial materials. Herein, an imidazolium-type cationic poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) and corresponding PIL membranes with antimicrobial properties were synthesized. The effects of these cationic polymers on the formation of bacterial nanotubes between Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) or Vibrio fischeri (V. fischeri), followed by intraspecies and interspecies exchange of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated. The results showed that bacteria tend to produce more nanotubes accompanied by drug-resistance trade, which can even make the ARGs of pathogens spread to the environmental microbes of V. fischeri. Given the unique antimicrobial sustainability toward bacteria after they acquire ARGs via bacterial nanotubes, antimicrobial PILs demonstrate bright prospects in the battle against resistant bacteria.","Mao H., Guo J., Zhou J., Shi J., Cui H., Shi R., Yao J., Fang X., Wang B., Yan F.",10.1039/d2bm01130a,Biomaterials Science
Insight Into The Responses Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Biofilms To Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles And Zinc Ions Pressures In Landfill Leachate,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms are hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in landfill environment. MP biofilms in landfill leachate coexist with heavy metals and metallic nanoparticles (NPs) that considered to be the selective agents of ARGs. However, the effects of these selective pressures on ARGs in MP biofilms and their differences in MP-surrounding leachate have not been well understood. Herein, the changes of ARG abundances in MP biofilms and corresponding leachate under zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs and zinc ion (Zn(2+)) pressures were comparatively analyzed. The presence of ZnO NPs and Zn(2+) promoted the enrichment of ARGs in MP biofilms, and the enrichment was more pronounced in ZnO NPs groups. ZnO NPs and especially Zn(2+) mainly decreased the abundances of ARGs in leachate. The increase of integron abundances and reactive oxygen species production in MP biofilms implied the enhanced potential for horizontal transfer of ARGs under ZnO NPs and Zn(2+) pressures. Meanwhile, the co-occurrence pattern between ARGs and bacterial genera in MP biofilms with more diverse potential ARG hosts was more complex than in leachate, and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria in MP biofilms under ZnO NPs and Zn(2+) pressures supported the enrichment of ARGs.","Shi J., Lv B., Wang B., Xie B.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132096,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antimicrobial Resistance (Amr) And Marine Plastics: Can Food Packaging Litter Act As A Dispersal Mechanism For Amr In Oceanic Environments?,"This study examined the carriage of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from Food-related Marine Macroplastic Litter (FRMMPL) around the coastline of Northern Ireland. FRMMPL was collected from 18 coastal sites during November/December 2018 and the bacteria from the surface of the plastic examined for their susceptibility to 10 common human antibiotics. Ten bacterial genera and 13 species were identified from the plastic materials. Bacteria isolated from plastic material were most resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, ceftazidime and cefpodoxime) (98.1% resistant) and least resistant to the tetracycline group, minocycline (16.1% resistant). This study is significant as it highlights a new potential route of dispersal of such antibiotic-resistance in the environment, which may act as carriers of such bacteria by introducing them into new marine ecosystems, as well as potential pathways having impacts on animal and human health, until their final interaction with the human foodchain.","Moore R.E., Millar B.C., Moore J.E.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110702,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Microplastics Act As Vectors For Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Landfill Leachate: The Enhanced Roles Of The Long-Term Aging Process,"Microplastics (MPs) are found to be ubiquitous and serve as vectors for other contaminants, and the inevitable aging process changes MP properties and fates. However, whether the MPs in aging process affects the fates of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in aquatic environments is poorly understood. Herein, the physicochemical property alteration of MPs being aged in landfill leachate, an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs, was investigated, and microbial community evolution and ARGs occurrence of MP surface during the aging process were analyzed. Aging process remarkably altered surface properties, including increasing specific surface areas, causing the formation of oxygen-containing groups, and changing surface morphology, which further increased the probability of microbial colonization. The bacterial assemblage on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential compared to leachate. ARGs quantification results suggested that MPs exhibited selective enrichment for ARGs in a ratio of 5.7–10(3) folds, and the aging process enhanced the enrichment potential. Further co-occurrence networks suggested that the existence of non-random, closer and more stable ARGs-bacterial taxa relations on MP surface affected the ARG transmission. The study of ARG partitioning on MPs indicated that extracellular DNA was a nonnegligible reservoir of ARGs attached on MP surface, and that biofilm bacterial community influenced ARGs partitioning pattern during the aging process. This study confirmed that the aging process could enhance the potential of MPs as vectors for ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding of MP behavior and risk in natural environments.","Su Y., Zhang Z., Zhu J., Shi J., Wei H., Xie B., Shi H.",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116278,Environmental Pollution
Facile Fabrication Of Injectable Multifunctional Hydrogels Based On Gallium-Polyphenol Networks With Superior Antibacterial Activity For Promoting Infected Wound Healing,"Multifunctional hydrogels hold significant promise for promoting the healing of infected wounds but often fall short in inhibiting antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and their clinical translation is limited by complex preparation processes and high costs. In this study, a multifunctional hydrogel is developed by combining metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) formed by tannic acid (TA) and gallium ions (Ga(3)⁺) with chitosan (CS) through a simple one-step method. The resulting CS-TA-Ga(3)⁺ (CTG) hydrogel is cost-effective and exhibits desirable properties, including injectability, self-healing, pH responsiveness, hemostasis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities. Importantly, the CTG hydrogels are effective against antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to the unique antibacterial mechanism of Ga(3)⁺. In vivo studies demonstrate that the CTG hydrogel promotes follicle formation and collagen deposition, accelerating the healing of infected wounds by inhibiting blood loss, suppressing bacterial growth, and modulating the inflammatory microenvironment. These findings highlight the CTG hydrogel's potential as an advanced and translational dressing for enhancing the healing of infected wounds.","Zou M., Chen C., Wang M., Lei C., Wang Y., Luo F., Huang D., Wang M., Zheng H., Wang B., Lin Z., Weng Z.",10.1002/adhm.202404283,Advanced Healthcare Materials
"Acinetobacter Baumannii Bacteriophage: Progress In Isolation, Genome Sequencing, Preclinical Research, And Clinical Application","Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a common nosocomial pathogen associated with serious clinical challenges owing to its rapidly increasing resistance to antibiotics.

Antibiotic Resistance At Environmental Multi-Media Interfaces Through Integrated Genotype And Phenotype Analysis,"Antibiotic resistance is currently an unfolding global crisis threatening human health worldwide. While antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are known to be pervasive in environmental media, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance at interfaces between two or more adjacent media is largely unknown. Here, we designed a microcosm study to simulate plastic pollution in paddy soil and used a novel method, stimulated Raman scattering coupled with deuterium oxide (D(2)O) labelling, to compare the antibiotic resistance in a single medium with that at the interface of multiple environmental media (plastic, soil, water). Results revealed that the involvement of more types of environmental media at interfaces led to a higher proportion of active resistant bacteria. Genotypic analysis showed that ARGs (especially high-risk ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were all highly enriched at the interfaces. This enrichment was further enhanced by the co-stress of heavy metal (arsenic) and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin). Our study is the first to apply stimulated Raman scattering to elucidate antibiotic resistance at environmental interfaces and reveals novel pathway of antibiotic resistance dissemination in the environment and overlooked risks to human health.","Fu C.-X., Chen C., Xiang Q., Wang Y.-F., Wang L., Qi F.-Y., Zhu D., Li H.-Z., Cui L., Hong W.-L., Rillig M.C., Zhu Y.-G., Qiao M.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136160,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Downward Transport Of Naturally-Aged Light Microplastics In Natural Loamy Sand And The Implication To The Dissemination Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Current understanding on the fate and behavior of microplastics (MPs) in complex soil media remains inadequate. We characterized the aging and hetero-aggregation of a MP sampled in farmland soil, and explored its vertical downward transport in natural loamy sand. The MP was identified with FTIR spectrum as polypropylene, a plastic lighter than water. FTIR spectrum combined with SEM imaging confirmed the MP was highly aged, generating colloidal plastic fibers and carbonyl groups. SEM imaging coupled with EDX analysis suggested hetero-aggregation of the MP with soil minerals. Soil leaching tests performed with the clean MP (without soil minerals) (CMP), the raw MP (RMP) (with soil minerals), and the RMP with humic acid (HA) (RMP + HA) demonstrated that the mobility was insignificant for the CMP, moderate for the RMP and highest for the RMP + HA, resulting in a maximal downward traveling distance of 0 cm, 3–4 cm, and 9–10 cm, respectively. Correlation between the maximal traveling distance and zeta potential of the CMP, RMP, and RMP + HA confirmed surface charge as a dominant control on the MP mobility; while the increasing density of the MP, due to hetero-aggregation with soil minerals, was identified as a driving mechanism for its downward transport, despite its intrinsic density lower than water. Occurrence of only the lower-sized rod-shaped plastic fibers at the maximal traveling distance suggested the natural aging, a process leading to plastic vibration and fragmentation, was conducive to plastic translocation. The three explored classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulfonamide) were all detected in the plastic surface, suggesting the MP may function as a potential pathway for the dissemination of ARGs to the deeper soil layer. These findings are important to understand the concentration distribution of both the MPs and ARGs in agriculture impacted soils, a natural reservoir of both emerging contaminants.","Yan X., Yang X., Tang Z., Fu J., Chen F., Zhao Y., Ruan L., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114270,Environmental Pollution
Sources Of Micro(Nano)Plastics And Interaction With Co-Existing Pollutants In Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the important source of micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) and pollutants (e.g. chemicals, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens) in natural environment, where the interaction in these co-existing substances has become an increasing concern. This work outlines the sources of MNPs and their interaction with pollutants in WWTPs, and assesses the potential risks after being discarded into natural environment. The sources of MNPs in WWTPs mainly include personal care products, washing clothes, surface runoff and atmospheric deposition as well as the inherent plastic equipment in WWTPs. MNPs can interact with various pollutants including ARGs and microorganisms, and organic and inorganic chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants antibiotics, and metals mainly through π-π, hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions and biofilm formation. Additionally, the WWTP conditions (e.g. pH, temperature) and components (e.g. dissolved organic matter, salinity and suspended particulates) can affect the interaction processes by modifying the sorption sites of MNPs and changing the property of MNPs and pollutants. Once being discharged into natural media, the individual and joint toxicological impacts of MNPs and associated pollutants to organisms via ingestion would be induced. As for the knowledge gap, more attentions should be focused on the contribution in various sources of MNPs and their interaction (especially submicron- to micron-size ranges) with ARGs, to improve understanding of the sources and pollution of MNPs and the combined risk with pollutants in natural environment.","Liu P., Dai J., Huang K., Yang Z., Zhang Z., Guo X.",10.1080/10643389.2022.2095844,Critical Reviews In Environmental Science And Technology
Effects Of Freeze-Thaw Dynamics And Microplastics On The Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil Aggregates,"This is the first study investigating the effects of freeze-thaw (FT) and microplastics (MPs) on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil aggregates (i.e., soil basic constituent and functional unit) via microcosm experiments. The results showed that FT significantly increased the total relative abundance of target ARGs in different aggregates due to the increase in intI1 and ARG host bacteria. However, polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) hindered the increase in ARG abundance caused by FT. The host bacteria carrying ARGs and intI1 varied with aggregate size, and the highest number of hosts was observed in micro-aggregates (<0.25 mm). FT and MPs altered host bacteria abundance by affecting aggregate physicochemical properties and bacterial community and enhanced multiple antibiotic resistance via vertical gene transfer. Although the dominant factors affecting ARGs varied with aggregate size, intI1 was a co-dominant factor in various-sized aggregates. Furthermore, other than ARGs, FT, PE-MPs, and their integration promoted the proliferation of human pathogenic bacteria in aggregates. These findings suggested that FT and its integration with MPs significantly affected ARG distribution in soil aggregates. They amplified antibiotic resistance environmental risks, contributing to a profound understanding of soil antibiotic resistance in the boreal region.","Xu F., Guan J., Zhou Y., Song Z., Shen Y., Liu Y., Jia X., Zhang B., Guo P.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138678,Chemosphere
The Effect Of Bulk-Biochar And Nano-Biochar Amendment On The Removal Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Microplastic Contaminated Soil,"Biochar amendment has significant benefits in removing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil. Nevertheless, there is little information on ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. Herein, a 42-day soil microcosm experiment were carried out to study how two coconut shell biochars (bulk- and nano-size) eliminate soil ARGs with/without microplastic presence. The results showed that microplastic increased significantly the numbers and abundances of ARGs in soil at 14d of cultivation. And, two biochars amendment effectively inhibited soil ARGs spread whether or not microplastic was present, especially for nano-biochar which had more effective removal compared to bulk-biochar. However, microplastic weakened soil ARGs removal after applying same biochar. Two biochars removed ARGs through decreasing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, potential host-bacteria abundances, some bacteria crowding the eco-niche of hosts and promoting soil properties. The adverse effect of microplastic on ARGs removal was mainly caused by weakening mobile genetic elements (MGEs) removal, and by changing soil properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that biochar's effect on ARGs profile was changed by its size and microplastic presence through altering MGEs abundances. These results highlight that biochar amendment is still an effective method for ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil.","Su X., Qian F., Bao Y.",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117488,Environmental Research
"Sewage-Associated Plastic Waste Washed Up On Beaches Can Act As A Reservoir For Faecal Bacteria, Potential Human Pathogens, And Genes For Antimicrobial Resistance","Sewage-associated plastic wastes, such as wet wipes and cotton bud sticks, commonly wash up on beaches; however, it is unclear whether this represents a public health risk. In this study, sewage-associated plastic waste, and naturally occurring substrates (seaweed and sand), were collected from ten beaches along the Firth of Forth estuary (Scotland, UK) and analysed using selective media for the faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) E. coli and intestinal enterococci (IE), and potential human pathogens (Vibrio spp.). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis was used to determine antibiotic resistance in selected strains. FIOs and Vibrio were more often associated with wet wipes and cotton bud sticks than with seaweed, and there was evidence of resistance to several antibiotics. This work demonstrates that plastics associated with sewage pollution can facilitate the survival and dissemination of FIOs and Vibrio and thus, could present an as yet unquantified potential risk to human health at the beach.","Metcalf R., White H.L., Moresco V., Ormsby M.J., Oliver D.M., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113766,Marine Pollution Bulletin
The Combination Of Polystyrene Microplastics And Di (2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate Promotes The Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Between Bacteria,"Plastic pollution has become a common phenomenon. The process of plastic degradation is accompanied by the release of microplastics and plasticizers. However, the coexistence of microplastics and plasticizers on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not been reported until now. Here, polystyrene (PS) microplastics and plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were used for combined treatment experiment and their effects and mechanisms on the transfer of ARGs between bacteria were explored. By increasing cell membrane permeability and the expression of correlated genes, the combined treatment group showed promoting effects on the transfer of ARGs than that of control, with the highest promoting effects observed at 1 mg/L PS and 0.1 mg/L DEHP, which was 3.0 times higher in ARGs transfer rate than that of control. It was found that PS and DEHP treatment alone also led to a higher conjugative transfer frequency, and the frequency of the combined treatment was lower than that of the corresponding single treatment group. This indicated that the effects of DEHP and microplastics on ARGs transfer might be antagonistic. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the transfer of ARGs affects bacterial ion binding, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism processes, while the expression of genes related to cell membrane permeability, DNA repair, bacterial drug resistance, and quorum sensing also increase. This study may provide new insights for explaining the combined effects of various pollutants in the environment on the spread of ARGs.","Li Y., Liu X., Guo S., Wang L., Tang J.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.117681,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Fumigation Practice Combined With Organic Fertilizer Increase Antibiotic Resistance In Watermelon Rhizosphere Soil,"Chemical fumigants and organic fertilizer are commonly used in facility agriculture to control soil-borne diseases and promote soil health. However, there is a lack of evidence for the effect of non-antibiotic fumigants on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in plant rhizosphere soils. Here, the response of a wide spectrum of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) to dazomet fumigation practice in the rhizosphere soil of watermelon was investigated along its branching, flowering and fruiting growth stages in plastic shelters using high-throughput quantitative PCR approach. Our results indicated that soil fumigation combined with organic fertilizer application significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs in the rhizosphere soil of watermelon plant. The positive correlations between the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs suggested that soil fumigation might increase the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) potential of ARGs. This result was further confirmed by the enhanced associations between ARG and MGE subtypes in the networks of fumigation treatments. Moreover, bipartite associations between ARGs/MGEs and microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) revealed a higher percentage of linkage between MGEs and microbial taxa in the fumigated soils. Structural equation model analysis further suggested that the increases in antibiotic resistance after fumigation and organic fertilizer application were mainly driven by MGEs and fungal community. Together, our results provide vital evidence that dazomet fumigation process combined with organic fertilizer in plastic shelters has the great potential to promote ARGs' dissemination in the rhizosphere, and raise cautions of the acquired resistance by soil-borne fungal pathogen and the potential spreading of ARGs along soil-plant continuum.","Du S., Ge A.-H., Liang Z.-H., Xiang J.-F., Xiao J.-L., Zhang Y., Liu Y.-R., Zhang L.-M., Shen J.-P.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150426,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects And Mechanisms Of Polystyrene Micro- And Nano-Plastics On The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes From Soil To Lettuce,"Effects of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil-plant systems are still unclear. To investigate the spread and mechanisms of ARGs from soil to lettuce, lettuce was exposed to soil spiked with two environmentally relevant concentrations of polystyrene MPs (100 μm) and NPs (100 nm). Results showed that microorganisms that carried ARGs in soil were increased after exposure to MPs/NPs, which led to an increase in ARGs in roots. NPs were absorbed by roots and can be transported to leaves. Analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics indicated that high concentration of NPs regulated the expression of related genes and proteins and improved the accumulation of flavonoids in the lettuce, therefore decreased the abundance of microorganisms that contained ARGs. Our work emphasizes the size and dose influences of MPs and NPs on the spread of ARGs from soil to plant.","Xu G., Li Y., Lin X., Yu Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169293,Science Of The Total Environment
Current Levels Of Microplastic Pollution Impact Wild Seabird Gut Microbiomes,"Microplastics contaminate environments worldwide and are ingested by numerous species, whose health is affected in multiple ways. A key dimension of health that may be affected is the gut microbiome, but these effects are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated if microplastics are associated with changes in proventricular and cloacal microbiomes in two seabird species that chronically ingest microplastics: northern fulmars and Cory's shearwaters. The amount of microplastics in the gut was significantly correlated with gut microbial diversity and composition: microplastics were associated with decreases in commensal microbiota and increases in (zoonotic) pathogens and antibiotic-resistant and plastic-degrading microbes. These results illustrate that environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations and mixtures are associated with changes in gut microbiomes in wild seabirds.","Fackelmann G., Pham C.K., Rodríguez Y., Mallory M.L., Provencher J.F., Baak J.E., Sommer S.",10.1038/s41559-023-02013-z,Nature Ecology & Evolution
Microplastics In Urban Waters And Its Effects On Microbial Communities: A Critical Review,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is one of the emerging threats to the water and terrestrial environment, forcing a new environmental challenge due to the growing trend of plastic released into the environment. Synthetic and non-synthetic plastic components can be found in rivers, lakes/reservoirs, oceans, mountains, and even remote areas, such as the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. MPs' main challenge is identifying, measuring, and evaluating their impacts on environmental behaviors, such as carbon and nutrient cycles, water and wastewater microbiome, and the associated side effects. However, until now, no standardized methodical protocols have been proposed for comparing the results of studies in different environments, especially in urban water and wastewater. This review briefly discusses MPs' sources, fate, and transport in urban waters and explains methodological uncertainty. The effects of MPs on urban water microbiomes, including urban runoff, sewage wastewater, stagnant water in plumbing networks, etc., are also examined in depth. Furthermore, this study highlights the pathway of MPs and their transport vectors to different parts of ecosystems and human life, particularly through mediating microbial communities, antibiotic-resistant genes, and biogeochemical cycles. Overall, we have briefly highlighted the present research gaps, the lack of appropriate policy for evaluating microplastics and their interactions with urban water microbiomes, and possible future initiatives.","Entezari S., Al M.A., Mostashari A., Ganjidoust H., Ayati B., Yang J.",10.1007/s11356-022-23810-2,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Understanding The Mechanism Of Microplastic-Associated Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Aquatic Ecosystems: Insights From Metagenomic Analyses And Machine Learning,"The pervasive presence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic systems facilitates the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), thereby posing risks to ecosystems and human well-being. However, owing to variations in environmental backgrounds and the limited scope of research subjects, studies on ARGs in MPs lack unified conclusions, particularly regarding whether different types of MPs selectively promote ARG enrichment. Analysing large-scale datasets can better encompass broad spatiotemporal scales and diverse samples, facilitating a more extensive exploration of the complex ecological relationships between MPs and ARGs. The present study integrated existing metagenomic datasets to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and comparative analysis of resistance groups across various MPs. In addition, we endeavoured to elucidate potential associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa, as well as MP structural features, using machine learning (ML) methods. The findings of our research highlight the pivotal role of MP type in shaping plastispheres, accounting for 9.56 % of the biotic variation (Adonis index) and explaining 18.59 % of the ARG variance. Compared to conventional MPs, biodegradable MPs, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polylactic acid (PLA), exhibit lower species uniformity and diversity but pose a higher risk of ARG occurrence. These ML approaches effectively forecasted ARG abundance by using the bacterial taxa and molecular structure descriptors (MDs) of MPs (average R(2)(tra) = 0.882, R(2)(test) = 0.759). Feature analysis showed that MDs associated with lipophilicity, solubility, toxicity, and surface potential significantly influenced the relative abundance of ARGs in the plastispheres. The interpretable multiple linear regression (MLR) model, particularly notable, elucidated a linear relationship between bacterial genera and ARGs, offering promise for identifying potential ARG hosts. This study offers novel insights into ARG dynamics and ecological risks within aquatic plastispheres, highlighting the importance of comprehensive MP monitoring initiatives.","Zhu T., Li S., Tao C., Chen W., Chen M., Zong Z., Wang Y., Li Y., Yan B.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122570,Water Research
Pyrimidine Synthesis Inhibition Enhances Cutaneous Defenses Against Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Through Activation Of Nod2 Signaling,"Multidrug-resistant bacterial strains are a rapidly emerging healthcare threat; therefore it is critical to develop new therapies to combat these organisms. Prior antibacterial strategies directly target pathogen growth or viability. Host-directed strategies to increase antimicrobial defenses may be an effective alternative to antibiotics and reduce development of resistant strains. In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy of a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), to enhance clearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains by primary human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. PALA did not have a direct bactericidal effect, but enhanced cellular secretion of the antimicrobial peptides human β-defensin 2 (HBD2) and HBD3 from fibroblasts. When tested in porcine and human skin explant models, a topical PALA formulation was efficacious to enhance MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii clearance. Topical PALA treatment of human skin explants also resulted in increased HBD2 and cathelicidin (LL-37) production. The antimicrobial actions of PALA required expression of nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIP2), and carbamoyl phosphatase synthase II/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydroorotase (CAD). Our results indicate that PALA may be a new option to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections of the skin through enhancement of an integral pathway of the cutaneous innate immune defense system.","Jatana S., Homer C.R., Madajka M., Ponti A.K., Kabi A., Papay F., Mcdonald C.",10.1038/s41598-018-27012-0,Scientific Reports
Effects Of Emerging Pollutants On The Occurrence And Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Review,"The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become major concerns for both public health and environmental ecosystems. Emerging pollutants (EPs) that accumulate in environmental compartments also pose a potential risk for the enrichment of ARGs in indigenous microorganisms. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of EPs, including microplastics, engineered nanomaterials, disinfection byproducts, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, on the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs. State-of-the-art methods for identifying culture-independent ARG-host interactions and monitoring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes in real-time are first reviewed. The contributions of EPs to the abundance and diversity of ARGs are then summarized. Finally, we discussed the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of HGT, increased mutagenesis, and the evolution of microbial communities. Further details of three HGT (i.e., conjugation, transformation, and transduction) frequency patterns in response to various EPs are also examined. This review contemplates and reassesses the risks of ARG evolution posed by the manufacture and application of EPs","Feng G., Huang H., Chen Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126602,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Distribution Of Microplastic And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Pollution In Jiulong River Estuary,"Pollution from microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is prevalent in estuarine regions. MPs may also enrich ARGs and increase the spread of ARGs. This study investigated the distribution characteristics of MPs in surface water and sediments from different stations in Jiulong River estuary for the first time, determined eight common ARGs abundance in each sample, and analyzed the correlation between MPs content and ARGs abundance. The results showed:① MPs concentrations in the Jiulong River estuary water environment ranged from 2 to 66 n·L-1, and the sediment content range (dw) was 8 to 85 n·kg-1. The main materials of MPs detected were polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE). More than 85% of the MPs were smaller than 1 mm. ② The predominant ARGs in the estuary were tetracycline resistance genes tetC and tetG and sulfonamide resistance gene sul2; the relative abundance of ARGs in the surface water showed a significant negative correlation with salinity. ③ A positive correlation existed among MPs concentration, ARGs relative abundance, and class1 integron geneintI1, which implied that MPs may promote the spread of ARGs in seawater.","Cheng H., Chen R.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202206008,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Aged Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Review Of Aging Effects On Their Interactions,"Background: Microplastic aging affects the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on microplastics, yet no review presents the effects of microplastic aging on the associated ARGs. Objectives: This review, therefore, aims to discuss the effects of different types of microplastic aging, as well as the other pollutants on or around microplastics and the chemicals leached from microplastics, on the associated ARGs. Results: It highlights that microplastic photoaging generally results in higher sorption of antibiotics and ARGs due to increased microplastic surface area and functional group changes. Photoaging produces reactive oxygen species, facilitating ARG transfer by increasing bacterial cell membrane permeability. Reactive oxygen species can interact with biofilms, suggesting combined effects of microplastic aging on ARGs. The effects of mechanical aging were deduced from studies showing larger microplastics anchoring more ARGs due to rough surfaces. Smaller microplastics from aging penetrate deeper and smaller places and transport ARGs to these places. High temperatures are likely to reduce biofilm mass and ARGs, but the variation of ARGs on microplastics subjected to thermal aging remains unknown due to limited studies. Biotic aging results in biofilm formation on microplastics, and biofilms, often with unique microbial structures, invariably enrich ARGs. Higher oxidative stress promotes ARG transfer in the biofilms due to higher cell membrane permeability. Other environmental pollutants, particularly heavy metals, antibacterial, chlorination by-products, and other functional genes, could increase microplastic-associated ARGs, as do microplastic additives like phthalates and bisphenols. Conclusions: This review provides insights into the environmental fate of co-existing microplastics and ARGs under the influences of aging. Further studies could examine the effects of mechanical and thermal MP aging on their interactions with ARGs.","Tang K.H.D., Li R.",10.3390/antibiotics13100941,Antibiotics
Host Species And Microplastics Differentiate The Crop Root Endophytic Antibiotic Resistome,"The increasing One-Health concept calls for a more in-depth understanding of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in plant microbiomes. While there is considerable published evidence that microplastics can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment, whether and how microplastics impact the plant endophytic resistome are largely unknown. Here we examined the ARGs along the soil-root continuum of maize and wheat under the pressure of microplastics. Amendment with heavy metals was also included as they can apply the selective pressure for ARG spread as well. The crop species and genotypes had significant effects on the root endophytic ARG abundance and diversity. The greatest ARG abundance was observed in the maize ZD958 endophytes (0.215 copies per 16S rRNA gene), followed by the maize XY335 (0.092 copies per 16S rRNA gene). For each crop genotype, amendment with microplastics and heavy metals significantly increased the ARG abundances and changed their profiles in root endophytes. The endophytic ARG variances were closely associated with the endophytic microbiome, the rhizosphere bacterial communities and resistome. Additionally, the level of endophytic ARGs was positively relevant to the abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These findings suggested that the root endophytic resistome was primarily affected by the crop species, and microplastics might show enhancement effects on the endophytic resistome via changing the root-associated microbiome and facilitating the MGE mediation. Overall, this study, for the first time, highlights the root endophytic ARG emergence and dissemination induced by microplastics.","Sun Y., Li X., Ding C., Pan Q., Wang J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130091,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Accelerated Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (Args) Induced By Non-Antibiotic Conditions: Roles And Mechanisms,"The global spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has wreaked havoc with the treatment efficiency of antibiotics and, ultimately, anti-microbial chemotherapy, and has been conventionally attributed to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, the ancient ARGs have alterative functions in bacterial physiology and thus they could be co-regulated by non-antibiotic conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that many non-antibiotic chemicals such as microplastics, metallic nanoparticles and non-antibiotic drugs, as well as some non-antibiotic conditions, can accelerate the dissemination of ARGs. These results suggested that the role of antibiotics might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of non-antibiotic conditions were possibly ignored. Thus, in an attempt to fully understand the fate and behavior of ARGs in the eco-system, it is urgent to critically highlight the role and mechanisms of non-antibiotic chemicals and related environmental factors in the spread of ARGs. To this end, this timely review assessed the evolution of ARGs, especially its function alteration, summarized the non-antibiotic chemicals promoting the spread of ARGs, evaluated the non-antibiotic conditions related to ARG dissemination and analyzed the molecular mechanisms related to spread of ARGs induced by the non-antibiotic factors. Finally, this review then provided several critical perspectives for future research.","Shi X., Xia Y., Wei W., Ni B.-J.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119060,Water Research
How Nanoscale Plastics Facilitate The Evolution Of Antibiotic Resistance?,"The plastic can enhance the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), however, the effect of nanoplastics (NPLs) on bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been clearly explained. Herein, we explored the effects and mechanisms of NPLs of different sizes (200 and 600 nm) on the evolution of antibiotic resistance in Serratia marcescens. The results indicated that the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance could be promoted under NPLs exposure, which the median of relative abundance of ARGs was 1.11–1.46 times compared to the treatment without NPLs. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the larger size of NPLs mainly increased the permeability of bacterial cell membranes to efflux antibiotics, thus potentiating antibiotic resistance. While, the smaller NPLs is more than that, its enhanced the expression of antibiotic resistance by modulating bacterial metabolic processes. The genome SNP analysis found that the NPLs could cause the genetic mutation occurrence to alter the membrane transport and metabolism processes, and it increased at a size of 200 nm more than at 600 nm NPLs. Importantly, we demonstrated that the horizontal transfer of ARGs was augmented due to the NPLs could dock to bacterial surface proteins and pull their movement to contact with other bacteria (binding energy of membrane proteins: −8.54 kcal/mol), especially the smaller size. It suggests that NPLs will also contribute to the proliferation of ARGs in the environment. This study provides data for understanding the risk of bacterial resistance.","Xu Y., Li H., Ding Y., Zhang D., Liu W.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136157,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Recent Advances In Biomedical, Therapeutic And Pharmaceutical Applications Of Microbial Surfactants","The spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens typically existing in biofilm formation and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, although unrelated phenomena, have demonstrated the urgent need for methods to combat such increasing threats. New avenues of research for natural molecules with desirable properties to alleviate this situation have, therefore, been expanding. Biosurfactants comprise a group of unique and varied amphiphilic molecules of microbial origin capable of inter-acting with lipidic membranes/components of microorganisms and altering their physicochemical properties. These features have encouraged closer investigations of these microbial metabolites as new pharmaceutics with potential applications in clinical, hygiene and therapeutic fields. Mounting evidence has indicated that biosurfactants have antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antiviral, immunomodu-latory and antiproliferative activities that are exploitable in new anticancer treatments and wound healing applications. Some biosurfactants have already been approved for use in clinical, food and environmental fields, while others are currently under investigation and development as antimicrobials or adjuvants to antibiotics for microbial suppression and biofilm eradication strategies. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, biosurfactants are now being explored as an alternative to current products or procedures for effective cleaning and handwash formulations, antiviral plastic and fabric surface coating agents for shields and masks. In addition, biosurfactants have shown promise as drug delivery systems and in the medicinal relief of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Ceresa C., Fracchia L., Fedeli E., Porta C., Banat I.M.",10.3390/pharmaceutics13040466,Pharmaceutics
Enhanced Propagation Of Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Municipal Wastewater By Microplastics,"Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global concern as they are abundant in the environment and can act as vectors of various contaminants. However, whether and how MPs can be vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs), remains far from explicit. This study addresses the adsorption of both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and eARGs by four types of MPs in municipal wastewater, and then explores the potential horizontal gene transfer of iARGs and eARGs exposed to MPs. Results indicate that though MPs significantly adsorbed both iARGs and eARGs, eARGs were adsorbed with a significantly higher fold enrichment (2.0–5.0 log versus 2.0–3.3 log) and rate (0.0056 min(−1) versus 0.0037 min(−1)) than iARGs. While all four types of MPs adsorbed ARGs, polypropylene MPs showed the highest adsorption capacity for ARGs. Background constituents such as humic acid and antibiotics significantly inhibited adsorption of iARGs, but not eARGs on MPs. The presence of sodium chloride didn't significantly affect adsorption of iARGs or eARGs. The adsorption of ARGs was well explained by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) interaction energy profile. Higher eARG adsorption was attributed to a lower energy barrier between MPs and eARGs than that between MPs and iARGs. Exposure to MPs enhanced horizontal gene transfer of both iARGs and eARGs by 1.5 and 2.0 times, respectively. The improved contact potential between donors and recipients, as well as the increased cell permeability of recipients induced the improved horizontal gene transfer by MPs. This study underscores the need to address ARG propagation through adsorption to MPs.","Cheng Y., Lu J., Fu S., Wang S., Senehi N., Yuan Q.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118284,Environmental Pollution
Dissemination And Genetic Relatedness Of Multidrug-Resistant And Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Isolates From A Burn Hospital In Iraq,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an aggressive opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes severe nosocomial infections, especially among burn patients. An increasing number of hospitals-acquired infections have been reported all over the world. However, little attention has been paid to the relatedness between A. baumannii isolates from different hospital environments and patients. In this study, 27 isolates were collected from the Burn and Plastic Surgery Hospital of Al Sulaymaniyah City, Iraq, from January through December 2019 (11 from patients and 16 from the wards environment), identified to species level as A. baumannii using Vitek 2 system and molecular detection of 16S rRNA gene, and then confirmed by targeting the blaOXA-51 gene. Moreover, the isolates were characterized by means of automated antimicrobial susceptibility assay, antimicrobial-resistant patterns, a phenotypic method using a combined disk test, and molecular methods for the detection of class A and C β-lactamase genes, and finally, the genetic relatedness was classified. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 63% (17/27) of the retrieved A. baumannii isolates were extensively drug-resistant to 8/9 antimicrobial classes. Furthermore, 37% (10/27) of the isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant; 8 isolates exhibited similar resistant patterns and the other two isolates showed 2 different patterns, while resistance was greater in isolates from patients than from the ward environment. Combined disk test showed that two isolates contained extended-spectrum β-lactamase. All isolates carried blaTEM-1, and two copies of the blaCTX-1 gene were indicated in one isolate, while blaSHV was absent in all isolates. Twenty-four isolates carried the blaAmpC gene; among them, 3 isolates harbored the insertion sequence ISAba-1 upstream to the gene. Using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR, the isolates were clustered into 6 distinct types; among them, two clusters, each of four strains, were classified to contain isolates from both patients and environments. The clusters of similar genotypes were found in inpatients as well as the environments of different wards during time periods, suggesting transmission within the hospital. Identification of possible infection sources and controlling the transmission of these aggressive resistance strains should be strictly conducted.","Shali A.A.K., Jalal P.J., Arif S.K.",10.1155/2022/8243192,Canadian Journal Of Infectious Diseases And Medical Microbiology
"Effects Of Tidal Action On The Stability Of Microbiota, Antibiotic Resistance Genes, And Microplastics In The Pearl River Estuary, Guangzhou, China","In this study, the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique was used to explore the microbial diversity and differences in the water environment of the Pearl River Estuary in Nansha District with various land use types such as the aquaculture area, industrial area, tourist area, agricultural plantation, and residential area. At the same time, the quantity, type, abundance, and distribution of two types of emerging environmental pollutants, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs), are explored in the water samples from different functional areas. The results show that the dominant phyla in the five functional regions are Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and the dominant genera are Hydrogenophaga, Synechococcus, Limnohabitans and Polynucleobacter. A total of 248 ARG subtypes were detected in the five regions, belonging to nine classes of ARGs (Aminoglycoside, Beta_Lactamase, Chlor, MGEs, MLSB, Multidrug, Sul, Tet, Van). Blue and white were the dominant MP colors in the five regions; 0.5–2 mm was the dominant MP size, and cellulose, rayon, and polyester comprised the highest proportion of the plastic polymers.

Effect Of Polyethylene Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes: A Comparison Based On Different Soil Types And Plant Types,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two types of contaminants that are widely present in the soil environment. MPs can act as carriers of microbes, facilitating the colonization and spread of ARGs and thus posing potential hazards to ecosystem safety and human health. In the present study, we explored the microbial networks and ARG distribution characteristics in different soil types (heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soil and agricultural soil planted with different plants: Bidens pilosa L., Ipomoea aquatica F., and Brassica chinensis L.) after the application of MPs and evaluated environmental factors, potential microbial hosts, and ARGs. The microbial communities in the three rhizosphere soils were closely related to each other, and the modularity of the microbial networks was greater than 0.4. Moreover, the core taxa in the microbial networks, including Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Myxococcota, were important for resisting environmental stress. The ARG resistance mechanisms were dominated by antibiotic efflux in all three rhizosphere soils. Based on the annotation results, the MP treatments induced changes in the relative abundance of microbes carrying ARGs, and the G1–5 treatment significantly increased the abundance of MuxB in Verrucomicrobia, Elusimicrobia, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria. Path analysis showed that changes in MP particle size and dosage may indirectly affect soil enzyme activities by changing pH, which affects microbes and ARGs. We suggest that MPs may provide surfaces for ARG accumulation, leading to ARG enrichment in plants. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPs, as potentially persistent pollutants, can affect different types of soil environments and that the presence of ARGs may cause substantial environmental risks.","Li Y., Shi X., Zeng M., Qin P., Fu M., Luo S., Tang C., Mo C., Yu F.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134581,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Rapid Colonisation Of Environmental Plastic Waste By Pathogenic Bacteria Drives Adaptive Phenotypic Changes,"Microbial biofilms on environmental plastic pollution can serve as a reservoir for both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Associating with this ‘plastisphere’, provides a mechanism for the wider dissemination of pathogens within the environment and a greater potential for human exposure. For pathogens to bind to environmental plastic waste they need to be in close contact with it; therefore, understanding how rapidly pathogens can bind to plastics and the temporal colonisation dynamics of the continual cycling between the plastisphere and the environment are important factors for quantifying the persistence of human pathogens. Using simulated environmental conditions, we demonstrate that pathogenic E. coli O157 can rapidly colonise plastics (within 30 min) and persist for extended periods (at least 21 days), at concentrations sufficient to cause human infection. Importantly, repeated colonisation and dissociation cycles of E. coli O157 from the plastisphere leads to an enhanced capacity for persistence and the emergence of variants with increased virulence traits, including improved biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance. This phenotypic adaptation to repeated colonisation of environmental plastic surfaces could be selecting for more persistent and virulent strains of pathogens, and hence increase the co-pollutant risks associated with plastic pollution.","Ormsby M.J., Woodford L., Fellows R., White H.L., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136359,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Traditional And Biodegradable Plastics Host Distinct And Potentially More Hazardous Microbes When Compared To Both Natural Materials And Planktonic Community,"Microplastic particles are persistent micropollutants that provide a substrate for the growth of bacterial biofilms, posing a threat to the environment. This study explores the changes in commercially available food containers made of conventional (polypropylene PP, polyethylene terephthalate PET), innovative biodegradable (Mater-Bi) and natural (wood and cellulose) materials, when introduced in the surface waters of Lake Maggiore for 43 days. Spectral changes revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy in PET and Mater-Bi, and changes in thermal properties of all human-made material tested indicated a degradation process occurred during environmental exposure. Despite similar bacterial richness, biofilms on PET, PP, and Mater-Bi differed from natural material biofilms and the planktonic community. Human-made material communities showed a higher proportion of potential pathogens, with PET and PP also exhibiting increased abundances of antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, these findings stress the need for dedicated strategies to curb the spread of human-made polymers in freshwaters, including innovative materials that, due to their biodegradable properties, might be perceived less hazardous for the environment.","Sabatino R., Zullo R., Di Cesare A., Piscia R., Musazzi S., Corno G., Volta P., Galafassi S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133166,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics-Induced Shifts Of Diversity And Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In River Water,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are both considered emerging contaminants of increasing concern because their combined pollution poses a serious risk to the ecological environment and human health. In this study, high-throughput quantitative PCR techniques were used to investigate the diversity and abundance of ARGs in river water, to which two different microplastics (PVC and PVA) were added for aerated incubation. The results showed that ARGs in river water were diverse, and microplastics could induce more types of ARGs. Although the number and abundance of ARGs decreased in all three treatments, which were cultivated for 14 d by aeration, compared to those in non-treated samples, the total abundance of ARGs in treatments aerated with MPs were higher than those aerated without MPs, especially in the samples treated with water-soluble microplastics (PVA). Significant correlations between the abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were observed, implying that the occurrence of MGEs may potentially affect the transmission and distribution of ARGs through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in river water.","Zhou X.-Y., Wang Y.-Z., Su J.-Q., Huang F.-Y.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202003146,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
"Interactions Of Microplastics With Organic, Inorganic And Bio-Pollutants And The Ecotoxicological Effects On Terrestrial And Aquatic Organisms","As emerging contaminants, microplastics (MPs) have attracted global attention.

They can physically adsorb or chemically react with organic, inorganic and bio-pollutants to generate complex binary pollutants or change the environmental behaviors of these pollutants. We systematically reviewed the following aspects of MPs: (i) Adsorption of heavy metals and organic pollutants by MPs and the key environmental factors affecting adsorption behaviors; (ii) Enrichment and release of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on MPs and the effects of MPs on ARG migration in the environment; (iii) Formation of “plastisphere” and interactions between MPs and microorganisms; (iv) Ecotoxicological effects of MPs and their co-exposures with other pollutants.

Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Estuarine Sediments,"Microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging pollutants/contaminants, and are also the research hotspots concerning environmental health in the past few years. To explore the effects of microplastics on ARGs in estuarine sediment, three different microplastics were added to microcosm incubation experiments of sediments. Then, we investigated the persistence, abundance, diversity, and shifts of the ARGs in estuarine sediments by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results showed that the microplastics significantly changed the structure of ARGs in the sediments. PVC and PE, which are hard to degrade, had significant effects on the structures and types of ARGs. However, the PVA, which is soluble, reduced the types and persistence of ARGs significantly. The abundance of ARGs in S_PVC, S_PE, and S_PVA were 4.1×109, 8.1×109, and 2.0×109 copies·g-1, respectively. The abundance of ARGs in sediments with added PE almost increased by one order of magnitude, implying that microplastics could significantly increase the abundance of ARGs in sediments. Furthermore, OLS regression analysis showed that ARGs are significantly correlated with transposon and integron, suggesting that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) may promote the transfer and dissemination of ARGs.","Huang F.-Y., Yang K., Zhang Z.-X., Su J.-Q., Zhu Y.-G., Zhang X.",10.13227/j.hjkx.201810108,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Microplastics As An Emerging Contaminant Of Concern To Our Environment: A Brief Overview Of The Sources And Implications,"Over the years, it has become evident that microplastics are one of the most important contaminants of concern requiring significant attention. The large abundance of microplastics that are currently in the environment poses potential toxicity risks to all organisms that are exposed to them. Microplastics have been found to affect the physiological and biological processes in marine and terrestrial organisms. As well as being a contaminant of concern in itself, microplastics also have the ability to act as vectors for other contaminants. The potential for microplastics to carry pollutants and transfer them to other organisms has been documented in the literature. Microplastics have also been linked to hosting antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes which poses a significant risk to the current health system. There has been a significant increase in research published surrounding the topic of microplastics over the last 5 years. As such, it is difficult to determine and find up to date and relevant information. This overview paper aims to provide a snapshot of the current and emerging sources of microplastics, how microplastics can act as a contaminant and have toxic effects on a range of organisms and also be a vector for a large variety of other contaminants of concern. The aim of this paper is to act as a tool for future research to reference relevant and recent literature in this field.","Stapleton M.J., Hai F.I.",10.1080/21655979.2023.2244754,Bioengineered
Gross Negligence: Impacts Of Microplastics And Plastic Leachates On Phytoplankton Community And Ecosystem Dynamics,"Plastic debris is an established environmental menace affecting aquatic systems globally. Recently, microplastics (MP) and plastic leachates (PL) have been detected in vital human organs, the vascular system, and in vitro animal studies positing severe health hazards. MP and PL have been found in every conceivable aquatic ecosystem─from open oceans and deep sea floors to supposedly pristine glacier lakes and snow covered mountain catchment sites. Many studies have documented the MP and PL impacts on a variety of aquatic organisms, whereby some exclusively focus on aquatic microorganisms. Yet, the specific MP and PL impacts on primary producers have not been systematically analyzed. Therefore, this review focuses on the threats posed by MP, PL, and associated chemicals on phytoplankton, their comprehensive impacts at organismal, community, and ecosystem scales, and their endogenous amelioration. Studies on MP- and PL-impacted individual phytoplankton species reveal the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, physical damage of thylakoids, and other physiological and metabolic changes, followed by homo- and heteroaggregations, ultimately eventuating in decreased photosynthesis and primary productivity. Likewise, analyses of the microbial community in the plastisphere show a radically different profile compared to the surrounding planktonic diversity. The plastisphere also enriches multidrug-resistant bacteria, cyanotoxins, and pollutants, accelerating microbial succession, changing the microbiome, and thus, affecting phytoplankton diversity and evolution. These impacts on cellular and community scales manifest in changed ecosystem dynamics with widespread bottom-up and top-down effects on aquatic biodiversity and food web interactions. These adverse effects─through altered nutrient cycling─have “knock-on” impacts on biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gases. Consequently, these impacts affect provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Our citation network analyses (CNA) further demonstrate dire effects of MP and PL on all trophic levels, thereby unsettling ecosystem stability and services. CNA points to several emerging nodes indicating combined toxicity of MP, PL, and their associated hazards on phytoplankton. Taken together, our study shows that ecotoxicity of plastic particles and their leachates have placed primary producers and some aquatic ecosystems in peril.","Amaneesh C., Anna Balan S., Silpa P.S., Kim J.W., Greeshma K., Aswathi Mohan A., Robert Antony A., Grossart H.-P., Kim H.-S., Ramanan R.",10.1021/acs.est.2c05817,Environmental Science And Technology
Rational Evolution Of Antimicrobial Peptides Containing Unnatural Amino Acids To Combat Burn Wound Infections,"Antimicrobial peptides have long been raised as a promising strategy to combat bacterial infection in burn wounds. Here, we attempted to rationally design small antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids by integrating in silico analysis and in vitro assay. Predictive quantitative sequence-activity models were established and validated rigorously based on a large panel of nonamer antimicrobial peptides with known antibacterial activity. The best quantitative sequence-activity model predictor was employed to guide genetic evolution of a peptide population. In the evolution procedure, a number of unnatural amino acids with desired physicochemical properties were introduced, resulting in a genetic evolution-improved population, from which seven peptide candidates with top scores, containing 1-3 unnatural amino acids, and having diverse structures were successfully identified, and their antibacterial potencies against two antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains isolated from infected burn wounds were measured using in vitro susceptibility test. Consequently, four (WL-Orn-LARKIV-NH(2), ARKRWF-Dab-FL-NH(2), KFI-Hag-IWR-Orn-R-NH(2) and YW-Hag-R-Cit-RF-Orn-N-NH(2)) of the seven tested peptides were found to be more potent than reference Bac2A, the smallest naturally occurring broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the designed peptides can fold into amphipathic helical structure that allows them to interact directly with microbial membranes.","Xiong M., Chen M., Zhang J.",10.1111/cbdd.12768,Chemical Biology And Drug Design
Fluvial Flooding And Plastic Pollution – The Delivery Of Potential Human Pathogenic Bacteria Into Agricultural Fields,"The frequency of plastic debris entering agricultural land is likely going to increase due to increased discharge into surface waters and more frequent flood events. Microbial biofilm on the surfaces of plastic pollution (known as the ‘plastisphere’) in freshwater environments often includes human pathogenic bacteria capable of causing disease. Pathogens have been detected on the surface of plastics in freshwater environments, but it is yet to be determined whether plastic debris can also transport pathogens into agricultural fields during flooding. Therefore, this study quantified the presence of viable pathogenic bacteria on the surface of plastic pollution at five agricultural fields along two rivers. All visible plastic debris, including sewage-associated plastic waste, were collected along a perpendicular 100 m transect from the riparian zone into each field. All plastic pieces were screened for five target bacteria (Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp.) using selective media, and positively identified colonies subsequently tested for antimicrobial resistance. In all five fields, there were higher volumes of plastic in the areas closer to the river, with 75% ± 24% of plastic collected within 30 m from the riverbank. Overall, 49% of all plastic collected in agricultural fields was colonised by phenotypically positive colonies for at least one or more target bacteria, with resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics detected among several of these target bacteria. Therefore, the transport of contaminated plastic debris from fluvial floodwater into agricultural fields could pose an as yet unquantified risk of introducing potentially harmful bacteria into agricultural systems and the ultimately into the food chain.","Pow C.J., Fellows R., White H.L., Woodford L., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125518,Environmental Pollution
Combined Environmental Pressure Induces Unique Assembly Patterns Of Micro-Plastisphere Biofilm Microbial Communities In Constructed Wetlands,"The characteristics and dynamics of micro-plastisphere biofilm on the surface of microplastics (MPs) within artificial ecosystems, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), remain unclear, despite these ecosystems’ potential to serve as sinks for MPs. This study investigates the dynamic evolution of micro-plastisphere biofilm in CWs, utilizing simulated wastewater containing sulfamethoxazole and humic acid, through physicochemical characterization and metagenomic analysis. Two different types of commercial plastics, including non-degradable polyethylene and degradable polylactic acid, were shredded into MPs and studied. The findings reveal that the types, shape and incubation time of MPs, along with humic acid content in wastewater, affected the quantity and quality of biofilms, such as the biofilm composition, spatial structure and microbial communities. After just 15 days into incubation, numerous microbials were observed on MP samples, with increases in biofilms content and enhanced humification of extracellular polymeric substances over time. Additionally, microbial communities on polylactic acid MPs, or those incubated for longer time, exhibit higher diversity, connectivity and stability, along with reduced vulnerability. Conversely, biofilms on polyethylene MPs were thicker, with higher potential for greenhouse gas emission and increased risk of antibiotic resistance genes. The addition of humic acid demonstrated opposite effects on biofilms across environmental interfaces, possibly due to its dual potential to produce light-induced free radicals and serve as a carbon source. Binning analysis further uncovered a unique assembly pattern of nutrients cycle genes and antibiotic resistance genes, significantly correlated within micro-plastisphere microbial communities, under the combined stress of nutrition and sulfamethoxazole. These results emphasize the shaping of micro-plastisphere biofilm characteristics by unique environmental conditions in artificial ecosystems, and the need to understand how DOM and other pollutants covary with MP pollution.","Yan P., Zhuang S., Li M., Zhang J., Wu S., Xie H., Wu H.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121958,Water Research
Granular Activated Carbon Remediates Antibiotic Resistance Propagation And Methanogenic Inhibition Induced By Polystyrene Nanoplastics In Sludge Anaerobic Digestion,"Nano/microplastics (NPs/MPs) in sewage sludge can induce oxidative stress to the anaerobic digestion (AD) and also proliferate antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has been used as an additive to enhance methane production in AD via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET); however, its impact on AD exposed to NPs/MPs is yet to be studied. This study examined the effect of GAC (5 and 15 g/L) on sludge AD exposed to 150 µg/L of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs). PsNPs decreased methane yield by 32.3% due to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. However, GAC addition counteracted this adverse effect and improved methane production, attributed to the potential enrichment of DIET-active microbes and the adsorption of PsNPs by GAC. Moreover, GAC reduced the total abundance of ARGs, which was increased by PsNPs exposure. Thus, GAC can provide dual benefits in mitigating methanogenic inhibition caused by PsNPs and ARG spread.","Mohammad Mirsoleimani Azizi S., Zakaria B.S., Haffiez N., Ranjan Dhar B.",10.1016/j.biortech.2023.128938,Bioresource Technology
Application Of Bacteriophage Φpap11-13 Attenuates Rat Cutibacterium Acnes Infection Lesions By Promoting Keratinocytes Apoptosis Via Inhibiting Pi3K/Akt Pathway,"Acne vulgaris caused by antibiotic-resistant Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) infection is difficult to treat conventionally. Phages have been suggested as a potential solution, but research on the mechanism of phage treatment is inadequate. This research investigates the underlying molecular mechanisms of phage φPaP11-13 attenuating C. acnes-induced inflammation in rat models. We found that rats infected with C. acnes had higher average ear thickness, greater enrichment of inflammatory cells as shown by hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining, and fewer TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling)-positive keratinocytes visualized by IF staining. Moreover, an increase of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1r) was detected using the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining method, Western blot (WB), and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) when infected with C. acnes, which was decreased after the application of phage φPaP11-13. By applying the IGF-1 antibody, it was demonstrated that the severity of C. acnes-induced inflammation was relevant to the expression of IGF-1. Through WB and qRT-PCR, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and a down-regulation of the BAD-mediated apoptosis pathway were discovered after C. acnes infection. Subsequently, it was shown that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway against BAD-mediated apoptosis pathway was alleviated after applying phage φPaP11-13. Furthermore, applying the IGF-1r inhibitor, Pan-PI3K inhibitor, and Akt inhibitor reversed the changing trends of BAD induced by C. acnes and phage φPaP11-13. This study demonstrates that one of the critical mechanisms underlying the attenuation of acne vulgaris by phage φPaP11-13 is lysing C. acnes and regulating keratinocyte apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. IMPORTANCE Cutibacterium acnes infection-induced acne vulgaris may cause severe physical and psychological prognosis. However, the overuse of antibiotics develops drug resistance, bringing challenges in treating Cutibacterium acnes. Bacteriophages are currently proven effective in MDR (multiple drug-resistant) Cutibacterium acnes, but there is a significant lack of understanding of phage therapy. This study demonstrated a novel way of curing acne vulgaris by using phages through promoting cell death of excessive keratinocytes in acne lesions by lysing Cutibacterium acnes. However, the regulation of this cell cycle has not been proven to be directly mediated by phages. The hint of ternary relation among ""phage–bacteria–host"" inspires huge interest in future phage therapy studies.","Liu Y., Zhen N., Liao D., Niu J., Liu R., Li Z., Lei Z., Yang Z.",10.1128/spectrum.02838-23,Microbiology Spectrum
Leveraging Broad-Spectrum Fluorescence Data And Machine Learning For High-Accuracy Bacterial Species Identification,"Rapid and accurate identification of bacterial species is essential for the effective treatment of infectious diseases and suppression of antibiotic-resistant strains. The unique autofluorescence properties of bacterial cells are exploited for rapid and cost-effective identification that is suitable for point-of-care applications. Fluorescence spectroscopy is combined with machine learning to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Good training data for machine learning can be obtained to achieve the same diagnostic accuracy for bacterial species as when each wavelength is measured in detail over a broad spectral width. Experiments were performed testing 14 bacterial strains. The excitation-emission matrix was analyzed, and Bayesian optimization was used to identify the most effective combinations of wavelengths. The results showed that fluorescence spectra using three specific excitation light regions or excitation spectra using two broad fluorescence detection regions could be used as supervised data to realize diagnostic accuracy comparable to that obtained with more complex instruments.","Mito D., Okihara S.-I., Kurita M., Hatayama N., Yoshino Y., Watanabe Y., Ishii K.",10.1002/jbio.202400300,Journal Of Biophotonics
(Micro) Nanoplastics Promote The Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Gene Propagation In Biological Phosphorus Removal System,"Microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as emerging pollutants, have been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants. However, the behavior of phosphorus and ARGs under MP and NP (MP/NP) pressure in biological phosphorus removal (BPR) system is still unknown. This study investigated the effects of MP/NPs on phosphorus removal and ARGs propagation in BPR system. Results showed that MP/NPs had no influence on phosphorus removal, but significantly promoted the amplification of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs). Moreover, the TRG abundance were more facilitated by MPs than NPs, and the TRGs of efflux pump and enzymatic modification mechanism were mainly enriched. Meanwhile, MP/NPs increased the transmission risk of multiple resistance genes and mobile gene elements (MGEs). Microbial communities demonstrated the main polyphosphate accumulating organisms shifted from Acinetobacter to unclassified_Gammaproteobacteria, which explained why phosphorus removal efficiency was unaffected with MP/NP addition. Correlation analysis revealed there was no significant correlation between ARGs and MGEs (intI1 and intI2), but the abundances of potential hosts of ARGs were significantly increased with MP/NP addition, implying microbial community structure changes rather than gene horizontal transfer was the main factor promoting ARG propagation under MP/NP pressure.","Zhou C.-S., Wu J.-W., Liu B.-F., Ma W.-L., Yang S.-S., Cao G.-L.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128547,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics Exacerbated Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Ultraviolet Disinfection: Highlighting Difference Between Conventional And Biodegradable Ones,"Microplastics (MPs) have been confirmed as a hotspot for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in wastewater. However, the impact of MPs on the transfer of ARGs in wastewater treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the roles and mechanisms of conventional (polystyrene, PS) and biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA) MPs in the conjugative transfer of ARGs during ultraviolet disinfection. The results showed that MPs significantly facilitated the conjugative transfer of ARGs compared with individual ultraviolet disinfection, and PSMPs exhibited higher facilitation than PLAMPs. The facilitation effects were attributed to light shielding and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nanoplastics from ultraviolet irradiation of MPs. The light shielding of MPs protected the bacteria and ARGs from ultraviolet inactivation. More importantly, ROS and nanoplastics generated from irradiated MPs induced intracellular oxidative stress on bacteria and further increased the cell membrane permeability and intercellular contact, ultimately enhancing the ARG exchange. The greater fragmentation of PSMPs than PLAMPs resulted in a higher intracellular oxidative stress and a stronger enhancement. This study highlights the concerns of conventional and biodegradable MPs associated with the transfer of ARGs during wastewater treatment, which provides new insights into the combined risks of MPs and ARGs in the environment.","Zhang X., Wang J., Yang Z., Zhang Z., Wang M., Zhang T., Chen Y., Wu X., Liu P., Jia H.",10.1021/acs.est.4c10991,Environmental Science And Technology

Do Microplastic Biofilms Promote The Evolution And Co-Selection Of Antibiotic And Metal Resistance Genes And Their Associations With Bacterial Communities Under Antibiotic And Metal Pressures?,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms with heterogeneous bacterial compositions and structure have become a hotspot of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. The evolutionary features of ARGs and their related factors including class 1 integron (intI1), metal resistance genes (MRGs), and bacterial communities in MP biofilms under exogenous pressures and how they compared with natural substrates (NS) are unclear. The individual and combined pressures of sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and zinc were used to drive the dynamic evolution of ARGs, intI1, MRGs, and bacterial communities in the MP and NS biofilms. The exogenous pressures from the combined selection of sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and zinc and their increasing concentrations both significantly enhanced the abundances of ARGs on the MP compared to the NS. Meanwhile, the selective pressures resulted in obvious dissimilarities between the MP and NS bacterial communities. The core bacterial taxa and the co-occurrence patterns of ARGs and bacterial genera in the biofilms of MP and NS were obviously different, and more potential ARG host bacteria selectively colonized the MP. Metal pressure also enhanced the enrichment of ARGs in the MP biofilms by promoting the spread of intI1 via the co-selection mechanism.","Liu X., Wang H., Li L., Deng C., Chen Y., Ding H., Yu Z.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127285,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Fate And Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Facility Vegetable Soil,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) coexist widely in farmland soils, but the fate and abundance of ARGs on MPs is rarely explored. In this study, high-throughput fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine ARGs on MPs in facility vegetable soil. The results indicated that when the particle size of the MPs was larger, the weathering was more serious, or the MPs came from soils with a long vegetable cultivation period, the levels of antibiotics and heavy metals on the MPs were higher. The distribution of the detected ARGs types on distinct MPs showed changes. Compared with weakly weathered MPs, the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes on strongly weathered MPs were decreased by 2.6% and 1.7%, while the detected sul-ARGs and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes were increased by 1.5% and 2.8%. Compared with smaller MPs, the detected MLSB and vancomycin resistance genes on larger MPs were decreased by 2.0% and 1.4%, while the detected fluoroquinolone, quinolone, florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amphenicol (FCA) resistance genes and sul-ARGs were increased by 1.2% and 1.0%. Compared with MPs in soil after three years of vegetable cultivation, the detected FCA resistance genes and sul-ARGs on MPs in soil after ten years of vegetable cultivation were decreased by 1.3% and 1.6%, while the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes were increased by 1.0% and 1.7%. This study suggests that MPs with larger size, stronger weathering or from soil after long-term vegetable cultivation adsorb more antibiotics and heavy metals and cause more mobile genetic elements, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance on the MPs.","Lu X.-M., Lu P.-Z., Liu X.-P.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136276,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects Of Microplastics On Distribution Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Recirculating Aquaculture System,"Microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two kinds of emerging contaminants with frequent detection in coastal regions. However, rare information on co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in coastal recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is available. This study performed field sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the distribution of microplastics and ARGs in a typical RAS farm. The results showed that microplastics were detected in all water samples with the abundances ranging from 58 to 72 items/m(3). Absolute abundances of total 10 ARGs in water samples ranged from 3.24 × 10(5) to 7.83 × 10(5) copies/mL while those on microplastic samples were in the range of 1.59 × 10(9)-1.83 × 10(9) copies/g. Microbial communities of microplastics and water showed significant difference at both phylum and genus levels. Microbial community diversity of microplastics was higher than that of water. ARGs including tetG, qnrS, sul1, sul2, and ermF possessed relatively more active relationships with bacterial community in water and on microplastics of the RAS farm. The results suggested that microplastics might be an important reservoir of ARGs in RAS farms. The findings of this study will provide useful information on pollution control and environmental management for both microplastics and ARGs in coastal aquaculture systems.","Lu J., Zhang Y., Wu J., Luo Y.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109631,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
"Isolation Of Hv-Crkp With Co-Production Of Three Carbapenemases (Bla(Kpc), Bla(Oxa-181) Or (Oxa-232), And Bla(Ndm-1)) And A Virulence Plasmid: A Study From A Chinese Tertiary Hospital","Background: The worldwide dissemination of K. pneumoniae isolates is a significant public health concern, as these organisms possess a unique capacity to acquire genetic elements encoding both resistance and hypervirulence. This study aims to investigate the epidemiological, resistance, and virulence characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates that carry both virulence plasmids and bla(OXA-48-like) genes in a tertiary hospital in China. Methods: A total of 217 clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) were collected between April 2020 and March 2022. The antimicrobial susceptibility test was conducted to evaluate the drug resistance profile. All isolates were screened for the presence of genes encoding carbapenemases (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), and bla(OXA-48-like)), ESBLs genes (bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(TEM)), and virulence plasmid pLVPK-borne genes (rmpA, rmpA2, iucA, iroB, and peg344) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Clonal lineages were assigned using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The plasmid incompatibility groups were identified using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). The transferability of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids and pLVPK-like virulence plasmids was assessed via conjugation. The plasmid location of rmpA2 was determined using S1-Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) and southern blotting hybridization. The virulence potential of the isolates was assessed using the string test, capsular serotyping, serum killing assay and a Galleria mellonella larval infection model. Results: Of the 217 CRKP clinical isolates collected, 23% were identified as carrying bla(OXA-48-like) genes. All bla(OXA-48-like) isolates exhibited resistance to commonly used clinical antimicrobial agents, except for ceftazidime/avibactam, colistin, tigecycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethOXAzole, polymyxin B, and nitrofurantoin. The main common OXA-48-like carbapenemase enzymes were found to be bla(OXA-181) and bla(OXA-232). MLST and PFGE fingerprinting analysis revealed clonal transmission and plasmid transmission. OXA-48-like producing CRKP isolates mainly clustered in K64 ST11 and K47 ST15. Results of the string Test, serum killing assay (in vitro) and Galleria mellonella infection model (in vivo) indicated hypervirulence. PBRT showed that the bla(OXA-181) and bla(OXA-232) producing hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Hv-CRKP) were mainly carried on ColE-type, IncF, and IncX3. Eight clinical isolates of hv-CRKP were identified as carrying three carbapenem-resistant genes (bla(KPC), bla(OXA-181 or OXA-232), and bla(NDM-1)). Moreover, Southern blotting hybridization revealed that all eight isolates had a pLVPK-like virulent plasmid (138.9–216.9 kb) with an uneven number and size of plasmid. Conclusion: In our investigation, we have observed the emergence of hv-CRKP carrying bla(OXA-48-like) genes, which identified two genetic relationships: clonal transmission and plasmid transmission. PBRT analysis showed that these genes were mainly carried on ColE-type, IncF, and IncX3 plasmids. These isolates have been shown to be hypervirulent in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, eight clinical isolates of hv-CRKP were identified as carrying three carbapenem-resistant genes (bla(KPC), bla(OXA-181 or OXA-232), and bla(NDM-1)) and carrying a pLVPK-like virulent plasmid. Hence, our findings highlight the need for further investigation and active surveillance of hypervirulent OXA-48-like producing Hv-CRKP isolates to control their transmission.","Li P., Luo W.-Y., Xiang T.-X., Peng T.-X., Luo S., He Z.-Y., Liao W., Wei D.-D., Liu P., Wan L.-G., Zhang W., Liu Y.",10.3389/fmicb.2023.1182870,Frontiers In Microbiology
Novel Functional Insights Into The Microbiome Inhabiting Marine Plastic Debris: Critical Considerations To Counteract The Challenges Of Thin Biofilms Using Multi-Omics And Comparative Metaproteomics,"Background: Microbial functioning on marine plastic surfaces has been poorly documented, especially within cold climates where temperature likely impacts microbial activity and the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms. To date, only two studies have used metaproteomics to unravel microbial genotype–phenotype linkages in the marine ‘plastisphere’, and these have revealed the dominance of photosynthetic microorganisms within warm climates. Advancing the functional representation of the marine plastisphere is vital for the development of specific databases cataloging the functional diversity of the associated microorganisms and their peptide and protein sequences, to fuel biotechnological discoveries. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment for plastisphere metaproteomics, using multi-omics and data mining on thin plastic biofilms to provide unique insights into plastisphere metabolism. Our robust experimental design assessed DNA/protein co-extraction and cell lysis strategies, proteomics workflows, and diverse protein search databases, to resolve the active plastisphere taxa and their expressed functions from an understudied cold environment. Results: For the first time, we demonstrate the predominance and activity of hydrocarbonoclastic genera (Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas) within a primarily heterotrophic plastisphere. Correspondingly, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism were the dominant pathways expressed. Quorum sensing and toxin-associated proteins of Streptomyces were indicative of inter-community interactions. Stress response proteins expressed by Psychrobacter, Planococcus, and Pseudoalteromonas and proteins mediating xenobiotics degradation in Psychrobacter and Pseudoalteromonas suggested phenotypic adaptations to the toxic chemical microenvironment of the plastisphere. Interestingly, a targeted search strategy identified plastic biodegradation enzymes, including polyamidase, hydrolase, and depolymerase, expressed by rare taxa. The expression of virulence factors and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance suggested pathogenic genera were active, despite representing a minor component of the plastisphere community. Conclusion: Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the functioning of the marine plastisphere, contributing new insights into the function and ecology of an emerging and important microbial niche. Our comprehensive multi-omics and comparative metaproteomics experimental design enhances biological interpretations to provide new perspectives on microorganisms of potential biotechnological significance beyond biodegradation and to improve the assessment of the risks associated with microorganisms colonizing marine plastic pollution.

Antimicrobial Resistance And Biotechnological Potential Of Plastic-Associated Bacteria Isolated From An Urban Estuary,"Plastics have quickly become one of the major pollutants in aquatic environments worldwide and solving the plastic pollution crisis is considered a central goal of modern society. In this study, 10 different plastic samples, including high- and low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, were collected from a deeply polluted urban estuary in Brazil. By employing different isolation and analysis approaches to investigate plastic-associated bacteria, a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, and Vibrio was observed throughout all plastic samples. Bacteria typically found in the aquatic environment harboured clinically relevant genes encoding resistance to carbapenems (blaKPC ) and colistin (such as mcr-3 and mcr-4), along with genetic determinants associated with potentially active gene mobilization. Whole genome sequencing and annotation of three plastic-associated Vibrio strains further demonstrated the carriage of mobile genetic elements and antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. On the other hand, bacteria isolated from the same samples were also able to produce esterases, lipases, and bioemulsifiers, thus highlighting that the plastisphere could also be of special interest from a biotechnological perspective.","Canellas A.L.B., Abdon B.B., Diniz M.N., Da Silva Oliveira Alves G., De Paula Lourenço M.F., Machado W.T.V., Giambiagi-Demarval M., De Oliveira B.F.R., Laport M.S.",10.1111/1462-2920.16540,Environmental Microbiology
Microplastic Diversity Increases The Abundance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Soil,"The impact of microplastics on antibiotic resistance has attracted widespread attention. However, previous studies primarily focused on the effects of individual microplastics. In reality, diverse microplastic types accumulate in soil, and it remains less well studied whether microplastic diversity (i.e., variations in color, shape or polymer type) can be an important driver of increased antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundance. Here, we employed microcosm studies to investigate the effects of microplastic diversity on soil ARG dynamics through metagenomic analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the associated potential health risks by profiling virulence factor genes (VFGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Our findings reveal that as microplastic diversity increases, there is a corresponding rise in the abundance of soil ARGs, VFGs and MGEs. We further identified microbial adaptive strategies involving genes (changed genetic diversity), community (increased specific microbes), and functions (enriched metabolic pathways) that correlate with increased ARG abundance and may thus contribute to ARG dissemination. Additional global change factors, including fungicide application and plant diversity reduction, also contributed to elevated ARG abundance. Our findings suggest that, in addition to considering contamination levels, it is crucial to monitor microplastic diversity in ecosystems due to their potential role in driving the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through multiple pathways.","Wang Y.-F., Liu Y.-J., Fu Y.-M., Xu J.-Y., Zhang T.-L., Cui H.-L., Qiao M., Rillig M.C., Zhu Y.-G., Zhu D.",10.1038/s41467-024-54237-7,Nature Communications
Plastic Pollution As A Novel Reservoir For The Environmental Survival Of The Drug Resistant Fungal Pathogen Candida Auris,"The WHO recently classified Candida auris as a fungal pathogen of “critical concern”. Evidence suggests that C. auris emerged from the natural environment, yet the ability of this pathogenic yeast to survive in the natural environment is still poorly understood. The aim of this study, therefore, was to quantify the persistence of C. auris in simulated environmental matrices and explore the role of plastic pollution for facilitating survival and potential transfer of C. auris. Multi-drug resistant strains of C. auris persisted for over 30 days in river water or seawater, either planktonically, or in biofilms colonising high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or glass. C. auris could be transferred from plastic beads onto simulated beach sand, particularly when the sand was wet. Importantly, all C. auris cells recovered from plastics retained their pathogenicity; therefore, plastic pollution could play a significant role in the widescale environmental dissemination of this recently emerged pathogen.","Akinbobola A., Kean R., Quilliam R.S.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115841,Marine Pollution Bulletin
"Insight Into Effects Of Polyethylene Microplastics In Anaerobic Digestion Systems Of Waste Activated Sludge: Interactions Of Digestion Performance, Microbial Communities And Antibiotic Resistance Genes","The environmental risks of microplastics (MPs) have raised an increasing concern. However, the effects of MPs in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems of waste activated sludge (WAS), especially on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), have not been clearly understood. Herein, the variation and interaction of digestion performance, microbial communities and ARGs during AD process of WAS in the presence of polyethylene (PE) MPs with two sizes, PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, were investigated. The results showed that the presence of PE MPs, especially PE MPs-1mm, led to the increased hydrolysis of soluble polysaccharides and proteins and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The methane production decreased by 6.1% and 13.8% in the presence of PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, respectively. Together with this process, hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens were enriched, and methanogens participating in acetoclastic methanogenesis were reduced. Meanwhile, ARGs were enriched obviously by the presence of PE MPs, the abundances of which in PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm groups were 1.2–3.0 times and 1.5–4.0 times higher than that in the control by the end of AD. That was associated with different co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial taxa and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria caused by the presence of PE MPs. Together these results suggested the adverse effects of PE MPs on performance and ARGs removal during AD process of WAS through inducing the changes of microbial populations.","Shi J., Dang Q., Zhang C., Zhao X.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119859,Environmental Pollution
A Neglected Risk Of Nanoplastics As Revealed By The Promoted Transformation Of Plasmid-Borne Ampicillin Resistance Gene By Escherichia Coli,"Plastic pollution and antibiotic resistance are two emerging environmental and human health crises today. Although it was revealed that microplastics can serve as vectors for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, it is still unclear how the nanoplastics influence the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Herein, we firstly compared the effect of polystyrene (PS) micro/nanoplastics on the transformation of plasmid-borne ARG, using a transformation model consisting of plasmid pUC19 (ampR ) and Escherichia coli DH5α (recipient). Due to its size effect, PS nanoplastics (10-500 mg/L) significantly enhanced the transformation efficiency (2.8-5.4 folds) and frequency (3.2-8.4 folds) of exogenous ampR into E. coli, while PS microplastics exerted no influence. The detailed mechanisms were found that nanoplastics induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, activated SOS response, increased cell membrane permeability and changed the secretion systems, thereby facilitating the uptake of exogenous DNA by bacteria. Moreover, the co-presences of nanoplastics with humic acid or Fe3+ relieved to some extent, but did not completely alleviate the promoting effect of nanoplastics on plasmid transformation. Our findings suggest that the risk of nanoplastics on promoting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance should not be neglected, and further studies are needed to investigate such risk in complex environments.","Wang X., Li H., Chen Y., Meng X., Dieketseng M.Y., Wang X., Yan S., Wang B., Zhou L., Zheng G.",10.1111/1462-2920.16178,Environmental Microbiology
Solid-Liquid Interface Adsorption Of Antibiotic Resistance Plasmids Induced By Nanoplastics Aggravates Gene Pollution In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have been identified as emerging pollutants in water environment; the interactions between antibiotic resistance plasmids (ARPs) and NPs will influence ARG transport in sediments. Herein, the adsorption experiments of a typical ARP onto polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in river and lake sediments were conducted to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms and the effects of environmental factors. Results indicated that the adsorption amounts of PS-NPs increased with the dosages while decreased with the particle size of sediments. Multi-layer adsorption of PS-NPs was found to exist mainly in sand and silt sediments, whereas the filling adsorption dominated in the clay. Moreover, the adsorbed PS-NPs enhanced the physisorption of ARPs in sediments through stimulating the intraparticle diffusion of ARPs induced by electrostatic force. Besides, the adsorption amounts of ARPs onto the PS-NPs decreased with the increasing pH and dissolve organic matter due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and competitive adsorption. The ion strength played catalytic roles by increasing the electrostatic attraction and adsorption sites of ARPs on PS-NPs. The adsorbed ARPs in sediments were closely related with the ARGs in extra/intracellular DNA of biofilms, influencing the distribution and proliferation of ARGs largely. The findings indicate that ARG-associated pollution might be enhanced by the solid-liquid interface adsorption induced by NPs, which was controlled by pH, ion strength and dissolve organic matter. This study provides supplementary insights into the roles of NPs as carriers of ARP in sediments, and advances our understanding on the risks of NP-ARG co-occurring contamination in aquatic ecosystems.","Li Z., Wang M., Fang H., Yao Z., Liu H., Zhao W., Chen J.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120456,Environmental Pollution
A Review Focusing On Mechanisms And Ecological Risks Of Enrichment And Propagation Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Mobile Genetic Elements By Microplastic Biofilms,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging ubiquitous pollutants in aquatic environment and have received extensive global attention. In addition to the traditional studies related to the toxicity of MPs and their carrier effects, their unique surface-induced biofilm formation also increases the ecotoxicity potential of MPs from multiple perspectives. In this review, the ecological risks of MPs biofilms were summarized and assessed in detail from several aspects, including the formation and factors affecting the development of MPs biofilms, the selective enrichment and propagation mechanisms of current pollution status of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MPs biofilms, the dominant bacterial communities in MPs biofilms, as well as the potential risks of ARGs and MGEs transferring from MPs biofilms to aquatic organisms. On this basis, this paper also put forward the inadequacy and prospects of the current research and revealed that the MGEs-mediated ARG propagation on MPs under actual environmental conditions and the ecological risk of the transmission of ARGs and MGEs to aquatic organisms and human beings are hot spots for future research. Relevant research from the perspective of MPs biofilm should be carried out as soon as possible to provide support for the ecological pollution prevention and control of MPs.","Zhou R., Huang X., Xie Z., Ding Z., Wei H., Jin Q.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.118737,Environmental Research
Response Of Sedimentary Microbial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes To Aged Micro(Nano)Plastics Exposure Under High Hydrostatic Pressure,"Several studies reported that the presence of microplastics (MPs)/nanoplastics (NPs) in marine environments can alter microbial community and function. Yet, the impact of aged MPs/NPs on deep sea sedimentary ecosystems under high hydrostatic pressure remains insufficiently explored. Herein, the sedimentary microbial community composition, co-occurrence network, assembly, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in response to aged MPs/NPs were investigated. Compared with the control, NPs addition significantly reduced bacterial alpha diversity (p < 0.05), whereas MPs showed no significant impact (p > 0.05). Moreover, networks under NPs exhibited decreased complexity than that under MPs and the control, including edges, average degree, and the number of keystone. The assembly of the microbial community was primarily governed by stochastic processes, and aged MPs/NPs increased the importance of stochastic processes. Moreover, exposure to MPs/NPs for one month decreased the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (from 94.8 to 36.2 TPM), while exposure for four months increased the abundance (from 40.6 to 88.1 TPM), and the shift of ARGs in sediment was driven by both functional modules and microbial community. This study is crucial for understanding the stress imposed by aged MPs/NPs on sedimentary ecosystems under high hydrostatic pressure.","Chen C., Lai H., Deng Y., Cao J., Chen J., Jin S., Wu W., Sun D., Zhang C.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135942,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Co-Occurence Of Antibiotics And Micro(Nano)Plastics: A Systematic Review Between 2016-2021,"Pollution by plastics and antibiotics are emerging issues in the areas of the environment and human health. In recent years, several studies have documented the widespread occurrence of plastic particles in various environmental, as well as human, systems, and much research has focused on possible interactions of contaminants with microplastics. Thus, the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics has caused another global problem for the environment and human health. Therefore, we focused on the current knowledge in the field of the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics to summarize the available studies. In this review, categorization of the topics, contaminants details, such as polymer type, size and source, antibiotic type, and other experimental parameters were summarized and discussed. This study indicated that the sorption of antibiotics on plastics, antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of plastics, and antibiotic resistance gene onto plastics were the most frequently examined categories in this field. Moreover, the variability in the procedures and the processes, and the heterogeneity data of reporting between different studies on similar topic make it difficult to bring all results together and produce a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that further research should be done using this systematic study.","Baysal A., Saygin H.",10.1080/10934529.2022.2082222,Journal Of Environmental Science And Health - Part A Toxic/Hazardous Substances And Environmental Engineering
Recent Advances On Ecological Effects Of Microplastics On Soil Environment,"The mass production and wide application of plastics and their derivatives have led to the release of a large number of discarded plastic products into the natural environment, where they continue to accumulate due to their low recycling rate and long durability. These large pieces of plastic will gradually break into microplastics (<5 mm), which are highly persistent organic pollutants and attract worldwide attention due to their small particle size and potential threats to the ecosystem. Compared with the aquatic system, terrestrial systems such as soils, as sinks for microplastics, are more susceptible to plastic pollution. In this article, we comprehensively summarized the occurrence and sources of microplastics in terrestrial soil, and reviewed the eco-toxicological effects of microplastics in soil ecosystems, in terms of physical and chemical properties of soil, soil nutrient cycling, soil flora and fauna. The influence of microplastics on soil microbial community, and particularly the microbial community on the surface of microplastics, were examined in detail. The compound effects of microplastics and other pollutants, e.g., heavy metals and antibiotics, were addressed. Future challenges of research on microplastics include development of new techniques and standardization for the extraction and qualitative and quantitative analysis of microplastics in soils, toxic effects of microplastics at microbial or even molecular levels, the contribution of microplastics to antibiotic resistance genes migration, and unraveling microorganisms for the degradation of microplastics. This work provides as a better understanding of the occurrence, distribution and potential ecological risks of microplastics in terrestrial soil ecosystems.","Ya H., Jiang B., Xing Y., Zhang T., Lv M., Wang X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149338,Science Of The Total Environment
Adsorbed Sulfamethoxazole Exacerbates The Effects Of Polystyrene (∼2 Μm) On Gut Microbiota And The Antibiotic Resistome Of A Soil Collembolan,"Microplastics pollution in the environment is now receiving worldwide attention; however, the effects of copollution of antibiotics and microplastics on the gut microbiome of globally distributed and functionally important nontarget soil animals remain poorly understood. We studied a model collembolan (Folsomia candida) and found that the ingestion of microplastics (polystyrene, 2-2.9 μm) substantially altered the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, and the isotopic fractionation in the soil collembolan tissue. Importantly, collembolans exposed to polystyrene microplastics loaded with sulfamethoxazole (MA) presented a distinctive gut microbiome, ARG profile, and isotopic fractionation compared to those exposed to polystyrene alone (MH). We observed that the abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the MA-treated collembolan guts was significantly higher than in the MH and the control treatments. There were also strong interactions between the gut microbiome and ARGs in the collembolan guts. We further found that bacterial β-diversity correlated significantly with the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in collembolan body tissues. Together, our results indicate that changes in isotopic fractionation and ARG profiles in the collembolan were induced by the changes in gut microbiota and suggest that microplastics from diverse sources may have profound influences on soil fauna and soil food webs.","Xiang Q., Zhu D., Chen Q.-L., O'Connor P., Yang X.-R., Qiao M., Zhu Y.-G.",10.1021/acs.est.9b04795,Environmental Science And Technology
Potential Risk Of Microplastics In Plateau Karst Lakes: Insights From Metagenomic Analysis,"Microplastic (MP) pollution has become one of global concern. While MP pollution in lakes has been well studied, research on MP sources, distribution, and ecological risks in the Tibetan Plateau is limited. We systematically investigated the MP abundance and distribution in alpine travertine lakes in Jiuzhai nature reserve located in east edge of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and assessed the distributions of microbiomes, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in water, sediments, and MPs, using macrogenomics. MP abundance was 20.27–58.80 n/L in water and 583.33–996.67 n/kg in sediments. MPs were dominantly fibrous and transparent. The particle size distribution was 0.1–0.5 mm for MPs in water, and 0.5–1 mm in sediments. MPs were mainly composed of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate. The microbial community of MP biofilms differed from that in the surrounding environmental medium, and Proteobacteria were more abundant in biofilm than in water and sediment. MP biofilms exhibited more cooperative behavior with microorganisms in water than with those in sediments. MPs were selectively enriched for ARGs and VFGs, and MP biofilms had a higher diversity of ARGs, the most abundant isoform being msbA, which is a multidrug resistance gene. VFGs were more abundant in MP biofilms than in water and sediment. The study results are useful for understanding MP sources and ecological risks in plateau karst lakes and provide a valuable dataset and theoretical basis for studies on MP pollution in other alpine calcareous lakes.","Zhou M., Luo C., Zhang J., Li R., Chen J., Ren P., Tang Y., Suo Z., Chen K.",10.1016/j.envres.2025.120984,Environmental Research
Stable Isotopes And Nanosims Single-Cell Imaging Reveals Soil Plastisphere Colonizers Able To Assimilate Sulfamethoxazole,"The presence and accumulation of both, plastics and antibiotics in soils may lead to the colonization, selection, and propagation of soil bacteria with certain metabolic traits, e.g., antibiotic resistance, in the plastisphere. However, the impact of plastic-antibiotic tandem on the soil ecosystem functioning, particularly on microbial function and metabolism remains currently unexplored. Herein, we investigated the competence of soil bacteria to colonize plastics and degrade (13)C-labeled sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Using single-cell imaging, isotope tracers, soil respiration and SMX mineralization bulk measurements we show that microbial colonization of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces takes place within the first 30 days of incubation. Morphologically diverse microorganisms were colonizing both plastic types, with a slight preference for PE substrate. CARD-FISH bacterial cell counts on PE and PS surfaces formed under SMX amendment ranged from 5.36 × 10(3) to 2.06 × 10(4), and 2.06 × 10(3) to 3.43 × 10(3) hybridized cells mm(−2), respectively. Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry measurements show that (13)C enrichment was highest at 130 days with values up to 1.29 atom%, similar to those of the (13)CO(2) pool (up to 1.26 atom%, or 22.55 ‰). Independent Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between the control plastisphere samples incubated without SMX and those in (13)C-SMX incubations (P < 0.001). Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating, at single-cell level, the capacity of bacterial colonizers of plastics to assimilate (13)C-SMX from contaminated soils. These findings expand our knowledge on the role of soil-seeded plastisphere microbiota in the ecological functioning of soils impacted by anthropogenic stressors.","Xiang Q., Stryhanyuk H., Schmidt M., Kümmel S., Richnow H.H., Zhu Y.-G., Cui L., Musat N.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124197,Environmental Pollution
Impacts Of Microplastic Type On The Fate Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Horizontal Gene Transfer Mechanism During Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are important pollutants in waste activated sludge (WAS), but their interactions during anaerobic digestion (AD) still need to be further explored. This study investigated variations in ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and host bacteria during AD under the pressure of polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). The results showed that the MPs increased methane production by 11.7–35.5%, and decreased ARG abundance by 5.6–24.6%. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease of MGEs (plasmid, prophage, etc.) promoted the decrease of the abundance of multidrug, aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes. Metagenomic annotation revealed that the reduction of key host bacteria (Arenimonas, Lautropia, etc.) reduced the abundance of major ARGs (rsmA, rpoB2, etc.). Moreover, PP MPs contributed to a reduction in the abundance of functional genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species, ATP synthesis, and cell membrane permeability, which was conducive to reducing the potential for horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. These findings provide insights into the treatment of organic waste containing MPs.","Xu M., Gao P., Gao Y., Xiong S.-J., Chen H.-Q., Shen X.-X.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121090,Journal Of Environmental Management
Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics In The Aquatic Environment Enrich Potential Pathogenic Bacteria And Spread Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Fish Gut,"Microplastics and antibiotics coexist in aquatic environments, especially in freshwater aquaculture areas. However, as the second largest production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the world, the effects of co-exposure to microplastics particles and antibiotics on changes in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles and the microbial community structure of aquatic organism gut microorganisms are poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to single or combined PVC microplastic contamination and oxytetracycline (OTC) or sulfamethazine (SMZ) for 8 weeks. PVC microplastics can enrich potential pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter and Acinetobacter, among intestinal microorganisms. The presence of PVC microplastics enhanced the selective enrichment and dissemination risk of ARGs. PVC microplastics combined with OTC (OPVC) treatment significantly increased the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes (1.40-fold) compared with that in the OTC exposure treatment, revealing an obvious co-selection effect. However, compared with those in the control group, the total abundance of ARGs and MGEs in the OPVC treatment groups were significantly lower, which was correlated with the reduced abundances of the potential host Enterobacter. Overall, our results emphasized the diffusion and spread of ARGs are more influenced by PVC microplastics than by antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic resistance in aquaculture.","Li W., Zeng J., Zheng N., Ge C., Li Y., Yao H.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134817,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Isolation And Characterization Of Human Pathogenic Multidrug Resistant Bacteria Associated With Plastic Litter Collected In Zanzibar,"Plastic pollution is a growing problem, not at least in areas where poor waste management results in direct pollution of coastal zones, such as South Asia and regions in Africa. In addition to the effect on ecosystems and their related services, plastic pollution may also affect human health indirectly as vectors for infectious disease. As plastic offers a suitable surface for the attachment of biofilm forming bacteria, it may contribute to disease outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance. To investigate the role of plastic litter as potential vectors for pathogenic bacteria, we collected plastic litter from four rural sites in Zanzibar, and isolated adhered bacteria. Isolates were short-read sequenced for further molecular analysis. This revealed that collected plastic litter was associated with diverse bacterial species, including human pathogens Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, most isolates were found to be multidrug resistant. Our findings confirm that plastic litter, serve as novel reservoir for human multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria that combined with poor sanitation and waste handling, may lead to transmission of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. These findings add a new level to the environmental challenges with plastic pollution; the potential health risk associated with exposure to plastic litter.","Rasool F.N., Saavedra M.A., Pamba S., Perold V., Mmochi A.J., Maalim M., Simonsen L., Buur L., Pedersen R.H., Syberg K., Jelsbak L.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124591,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastic Biofilm: An Important Microniche That May Accelerate The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Via Natural Transformation,"Microplastic (MP) biofilms provide a specific microniche for microbial life and are a potential hotspot for the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Nevertheless, the acquisition of ARGs in MP biofilms via natural transformation mediated by extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been rarely explored. This study demonstrated that MP biofilms promoted the natural transformation of extracellular ARGs at the single-cell and multi-species levels, compared to natural substrate (NS) biofilms and bacterioplankton. The transformation frequency on MP biofilms was up to 1000-fold compare to that on NS. The small MPs and aged MPs enhanced the ARG transformation frequencies up to 77.16-fold and 32.05-fold, respectively, compared with the large MPs and pristine MPs. The transformation frequencies on MP biofilms were significantly positively correlated with the bacterial density and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MPs significantly increased the expression of the biofilm formation related genes (motA and pgaA) and DNA uptake related genes (pilX and comA) compared to NS and bacterioplankton. The more transformants colonized on MPs contributed to the enhanced transformation frequencies at the community-wide level. Overall, eDNA-mediated transformation in MP biofilms may be an important path of ARG spread, which was promoted by heterogeneous biofilm.","Wang H., Xu K., Wang J., Feng C., Chen Y., Shi J., Ding Y., Deng C., Liu X.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132085,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Protective Efficacy Of Phage Pvn02 Against Haemorrhagic Septicaemia In Striped Catfish Pangasianodon Hypophthalmus Via Oral Administration,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Aeromonas hydrophila in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is one of the most important aquatic diseases in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. However, antibiotic-resistant A. hydrophila strains have become popular and resulted in inadequate control of the disease in striped catfish farms. This study investigates the protective efficacy of bacteriophage PVN02 against haemorrhagic septicaemia in striped catfish via oral administration. The phage-containing pellets were prepared by spraying the phage solution on food pellets at 20 ml/kg. The rate of phage desorption from the food pellets into the water was very low; the phage titres in the water were approximately log 1.0 PFU/ml or undetectable. The in vivo experiment evaluating the protective efficacy of PVN02 against haemorrhagic septicaemia in striped catfish was conducted using 21 groups of 1,260 fish in 50-L plastic tanks in triplicate. The catfish were fed twice daily with phage-sprayed pellets. Different densities of bacterial suspensions were added into the tanks for 24 hr. Without the existence of the phage, the highest mortality rate was 68.3 ± 2.9% at the highest density of bacterial suspension. In contrast, the mortality rate at the highest density of bacterial suspension was significantly reduced to 8.33 ± 2.9% or 16.67 ± 2.9% at the phage dose of log 6.2 ± 0.09 or log 4.2 ± 0.09 PFU/g. This study provides a very practical manner of applying phage therapy to prevent disease in large-scale striped catfish farms.","Dang T.H.O., Xuan T.T.T., Duyen L.T.M., Le N.P., Hoang H.A.",10.1111/jfd.13387,Journal Of Fish Diseases
Do Plastics Serve As A Possible Vector For The Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance? First Insights From Bacteria Associated To A Polystyrene Piece From King George Island (Antarctica),"The retrieval of a polystyrene macro-plastic piece stranded on the shores in King George Island (South Shetlands, Antarctica) gave the opportunity to explore the associated bacterial flora. A total of 27 bacterial isolates were identified by molecular 16s rRNA gene sequencing and 7 strains were selected and screened for their ability to produce biofilm and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. All the bacterial isolates were able to produce biofilm. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test to 34 antibiotics showed multiple antibiotic resistances against the molecules cefuroxime and cefazolin (belonging to cephalosporins), cinoxacin (belonging to quinolones) and ampicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, carbenicillin and mezlocillin (belonging to beta-lactams).

Surveillance Of Antibiotic Susceptibility In A Swedish Burn Center 1994–2012,"Patients with burn trauma are at risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (ABR) with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality. As part of the Swedish strategic program against antibiotic resistance in intensive care (ICU-Strama), we have surveyed the distribution of species and ABR in isolates from patients admitted to a Swedish burn center at Linköping University Hospital from 1994 through 2012. In an international comparison Strama has been successful in reducing the antibiotic consumption among animals and humans in primary care. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic consumption pressure and resistance rates in a Swedish burn unit. Methods Microbiology data, total body surface area (TBSA), patient days, and mortality were collected from a hospital database for all patients admitted to the Burn Center at the University Hospital of Linköping from April 1994 through December 2012. Results A total of 1570 patients were admitted with a mean annual admission rate of 83 patients (range: 57–152). 15,006 microbiology cultures (approximately 10 per patient) were collected during the study period and of these 4531 were positive (approximately 3 per patient). The annual mean total body surface area (TBSA) was 13.4% (range 9.5–18.5) with an annual mortality rate of 5.4% (range 1–8%). The MRSA incidence was 1.7% (15/866) which corresponds to an MRSA incidence of 0.34/1000 admission days (TAD). Corresponding figures were for Escherichia coli resistant to 3(rd) generation cephalosporins (ESBL phenotype) 8% (13/170) and 0.3/TAD, Klebsiella spp. ESBL phenotype 5% (6/134) and 0.14/TAD, carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 26% (56/209) and 1.28/TAD, and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter spp. 3% (2/64) and 0.04/TAD.

Deterioration Of Sludge Characteristics And Promotion Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes Spread With The Co-Existing Of Polyvinylchloride Microplastics And Tetracycline In The Sequencing Batch Reactor,"With the continuous increase in microplastics (MPs) and tetracycline (TC) entering wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along with sewage, the co-existence of MPs and TC in the biological treatment of wastewater has attracted extensive attention. This study investigated the effect of 1 mg/L polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs and 100 ng/L TC co-existing on sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) (S2) treating phenol wastewater in contrast to the control with TC alone (S1). The phenol removal efficiency was significantly inhibited by the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC. Sludge characteristics were also distinctively influenced. The decreased zone sludge velocity (ZSV) and increased sludge volume index (SVI) indicated that the combined effect of PVC MPs and TC deteriorated sludge settleability, which had positive and negative linear correlations with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content and the protein (PN)/polysaccharide (PS) ratio, respectively. Moreover, the decreased and increased relative abundances of potential phenol-degraders and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) carriers may elucidate the inhibition of phenol removal and promotion of ARGs propagation with the co-occurrence of PVC MPs and TC. In addition, the enhanced potential ARGs hosts, loss of the EPS protective effect, and increased membrane permeability induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) jointly promoted ARGs dissemination in the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC. Notably, the co-occurrence of ARGs and mobile genetic element (MGEs) indicated that the co-existence of PVC MPs and TC promoted the spread of some transposase-associated ARGs mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).","Liu Q., Li Y., Sun Y., Xie K., Zeng Q., Hao Y., Yang Q., Pu Y., Shi S., Gong Z.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167544,Science Of The Total Environment
Interactions Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Their Effects On The Aquaculture Environments,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become the increasing attention and global research hotpots due to their unique ecological and environmental effects. As susceptible locations for MPs and ARGs, aquaculture environments play an important role in their enrichment and transformation. In this review, we focused on the MPs, ARGs, and the effects of their interactions on the aquaculture environments. The facts that antibiotics have been widely applied in different kinds of agricultural productions (e.g., aquaculture) and that most of antibiotics enter the water environment with rainfall and residual in the aquaculture environment have been resulting in the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB). Moreover, the water MPs are effective carriers of the environmental microbes and ARB, making them likely to be continuously imported into the aquaculture environments. As a result, the formation of the compound pollutions may also enter the aquatic organisms through the food chains and eventually enter the human body after a long-term enrichment. Furthermore, the compound pollutions result in the joint toxic effects on the human health and the ecological environment. In summary, this review aims to emphasize the ecological effects and the potential hazards on the aquaculture environments where interactions between MPs and ARGs results, and calls for to reduce the use of the plastic products and the antibiotics in the aquaculture environments.","Dong H., Chen Y., Wang J., Zhang Y., Zhang P., Li X., Zou J., Zhou A.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123961,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Plasmid-Mediated Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer Under Environmental Stresses: Insights From Laboratory-Based Studies,"Although clinical settings play a major role in the current global dissemination of antibiotic resistance, once antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes are released into the environment, their fate will be subject to complex ecological processes. One of the processes prevalent in microbial communities – horizontal gene transfer – can largely facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across phylogenetic and ecological boundaries. Especially, plasmid transfer has aroused increasing concern as it has been proved a significant role in promoting ARG dissemination. As a multi-step process, plasmid transfer can be influenced by various factors, among which those stresses caused by environmental pollutants are important elements affecting the plasmid mediated ARG transfer in the environment. In fact, diverse traditional and emerging pollutants are continuously entering the environment nowadays, as evidenced by the global occurrence of pollutants like metals and pharmaceuticals in aquatic and terrestrial systems. It is therefore imperative to understand to what extent and in which way the plasmid mediated ARG dissemination can be influenced by these stresses. Over the past decades, numerous research endeavours have been made to understand the plasmid mediated ARG transfer under various environmental relevant pressures. In this review, progress and challenges of studies on environmental stress regulating plasmid mediated ARG dissemination will be discussed, with specific focus on emerging pollutants like antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, metals and their nanoparticles, disinfectants and disinfection by-products, as well as the emerging particulate matter like microplastics. Despite the previous efforts, we are still lacking insights into the in situ plasmid transfer under environmental stresses, which can be addressed by future studies considering environmental relevant pollution status and multi-species microbial communities. We believe that future development of standardized high-throughput screening platforms will assist in rapidly identifying which pollutants enhance plasmid transfer and also which ones may block such gene transfer processes.","Li L.-G., Zhang T.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163870,Science Of The Total Environment
Whole Community And Functional Gene Changes Of Biofilms On Marine Plastic Debris In Response To Ocean Acidification,"Plastics are accumulating in the world's oceans, while ocean waters are becoming acidified by increased CO2. We compared metagenome of biofilms on tethered plastic bottles in subtidal waters off Japan naturally enriched in CO2, compared to normal ambient CO2 levels. Extending from an earlier amplicon study of bacteria, we used metagenomics to provide direct insights into changes in the full range of functional genes and the entire taxonomic tree of life in the context of the changing plastisphere. We found changes in the taxonomic community composition of all branches of life. This included a large increase in diatom relative abundance across the treatments but a decrease in diatom diversity. Network complexity among families decreased with acidification, showing overall simplification of biofilm integration. With acidification, there was decreased prevalence of genes associated with cell-cell interactions and antibiotic resistance, decreased detoxification genes, and increased stress tolerance genes. There were few nutrient cycling gene changes, suggesting that the role of plastisphere biofilms in nutrient processes within an acidified ocean may not change greatly. Our results suggest that as ocean CO2 increases, the plastisphere will undergo broad-ranging changes in both functional and taxonomic composition, especially the ecologically important diatom group, with possible wider implications for ocean ecology.","Kerfahi D., Harvey B.P., Kim H., Yang Y., Adams J.M., Hall-Spencer J.M.",10.1007/s00248-022-01987-w,Microbial Ecology
Uv-Aging Of Microplastics Increases Proximal Arg Donor-Recipient Adsorption And Leaching Of Chemicals That Synergistically Enhance Antibiotic Resistance Propagation,"Despite growing attention to environmental pollution by microplastics (MP), the effects of MP aging on bacterial horizontal gene transfer (HGT) have not been systematically investigated. Here, we used UV-aged polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) to investigate how aging affects antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transfer efficiency from various ARG vectors to recipient bacteria. The adsorption capacity of MP(20) (20-day UV-aged PS-MPs) towards E. coli (harboring plasmid-borne bla(TEM-1)), plasmid pET29 (harboring bla(NDM-1)) and phage lambda (carrying the aphA1 ARG) increased by 6.6-, 5.2- and 8.3-fold, respectively, relative to pristine PS-MPs (MP(0)), due to increased specific surface area and affinity for these ARG vectors. Moreover, MP(20) released more organic compounds (TOC 1.6 mg/g-MP(20), versus 0.2 mg/g-MP(0) in 4 h) –possibly depolymerization byproducts (verified by GC-MS), which induced intracellular ROS generation, increased cell permeability and upregulated HGT associated genes. Accordingly, MP(20) enhanced ARG transfer frequency from E. coli, plasmid pET29 and phage lambda (relative to MP(0)) by 1.3-, 4.7- and 3.5-fold, respectively. The Bliss independence model infers that higher bacterial adsorption and exposure to chemicals released during MP aging synergistically enhanced ARG transfer. This underscores the need to assess the significance of this overlooked phenomenon to the environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other HGT processes.","Yuan Q., Sun R., Yu P., Cheng Y., Wu W., Bao J., Alvarez P.J.J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127895,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Direct, Rapid Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test From Positive Blood Cultures Based On Microscopic Imaging Analysis","For the timely treatment of patients with infections in bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid, a rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) is urgently needed. Here, we describe a direct and rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (dRAST) system, which can determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria from a positive blood culture bottle (PBCB) in six hours. The positive blood culture sample is directly mixed with agarose and inoculated into a micropatterned plastic microchip with lyophilized antibiotic agents. Using microscopic detection of bacterial colony formation in agarose, the total time to result from a PBCB for dRAST was only six hours for a wide range of bacterial concentrations in PBCBs. The results from the dRAST system were consistent with the results from a standard AST, broth microdilution test. In tests of clinical isolates (n = 206) composed of 16 Gram-negative species and seven Gram-positive species, the dRAST system was accurate compared to the standard broth microdilution test, with rates of 91.11% (2613/2868) categorical agreement, 6.69% (192/2868) minor error, 2.72% (50/1837) major error and 1.45% (13/896) very major error. Thus, the dRAST system can be used to rapidly identify appropriate antimicrobial agents for the treatment of blood stream infection (BSI) and antibiotic-resistant strain infections.","Choi J., Jeong H.Y., Lee G.Y., Han S., Han S., Jin B., Lim T., Kim S., Kim D.Y., Kim H.C., Kim E.-C., Song S.H., Kim T.S., Kwon S.",10.1038/s41598-017-01278-2,Scientific Reports
Impact Of Urbanization On Antibiotic Resistome In Different Microplastics: Evidence From A Large-Scale Whole River Analysis,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous in environments and viewed as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Rivers connecting differently urbanized areas contribute a significant input of MPs and ARGs to the environment. However, a systematic study assessing the role of urbanization in shaping antibiotic resistome and mobilome in riverine MPs is lacking. Here, we conducted a large-scale study by placing five types of MPs (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene-fiber, and polyethylene-fiber-polyethylene) into Beilun River with an urbanization gradient. A total of 314 ARGs and 57 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in MPs by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ARGs in MPs showed a clear spatial distribution with the abundance increased by 2 orders of magnitude from rural to urban regions. A holistic analysis of 13 socioeconomic and environmental factors identified that urbanization predominantly contributed to both the abundance and potential MGE-mediated dissemination of ARGs in riverine MPs. Notably, MPs types were found to significantly affect the resistome and dissemination risk of ARGs, with polypropylene being the preferred substrates to acquire and spread ARGs. This work highlights the necessity of controlling MPs and ARGs pollution in urban areas and provides an important guide for the future usage and disposal of plastics.","Li R., Zhu L., Yang K., Li H., Zhu Y.-G., Cui L.",10.1021/acs.est.1c01395,Environmental Science And Technology
Effects Of Soil Solarization Combined With Manure-Amended On Soil Args And Microbial Communities During Summer Fallow,"Soil solarization (SS) is a technique for managing pathogens and weeds, which involves covering with transparent plastic to increase soil temperature during summer fallow (SF). However, SS also alters the diversity of bacterial communities. Therefore, during SF, various organic modifiers are used in combination with SS to improve its efficacy. Organic amendments may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) soils are vital to ensure food security and ecological balance. However, comprehensive study on the effects of SS combined with different types of manure on ARGs in GVP soils during SF remains unclear. Therefore, this study employed high-throughput qPCR to explore the effects of different organic amendments combined with SS on the abundance changes of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in GVP soils during SF. The abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs in GVP soils with different manure fertilization and SS decreased during SF. Horizontal gene transfer via MGEs (especially integrases 45.80%) induced by changes in environmental factors (NO(3)(−)-N 14.7% and NH(4)(+)-N) was the main factor responsible for the changes in ARGs. Proteobacteria (14.3%) and Firmicutes were the main potential hosts of ARGs. Network analysis suggested that Ornithinimicrobium, Idiomarina and Corynebacterium had positive correlations with aminoglycosides, MLSB, and tetracycline resistance genes. These results provide new insights to understand the fate of ARGs in the GVP soils by manure-amended combined with SS during SF, which may help to reduce the spread of ARGs.","Wang X., Zhang L., Gu J., Feng Y., He K., Jiang H.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121950,Environmental Pollution
Host Defense Against Klebsiella Pneumoniae Pneumonia Is Augmented By Lung-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of Gram-negative pneumonia. The spread of antibiotic-resistant and hypervirulent strains has made treatment more challenging. This study sought to determine the immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and therapeutic potential of purified murine stem cell Ag-1+ (Sca-1+) lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs) using in vitro cell culture and an in vivo mouse model of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae. Sca-1+ LMSCs are plastic adherent, possess colony-forming capacity, express mesenchymal stem cell markers, differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro, and exhibit a high proliferative capacity. Further, these Sca-1+ LMSCs are morphologically similar to fibroblasts but differ ultrastructurally. Moreover, Sca-1+ LMSCs have the capacity to inhibit LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines by bone marrow_derived macrophages and neutrophils in vitro. Sca-1+ LMSCs inhibit the growth of K. pneumoniae more potently than do neutrophils. Sca-1+ LMSCs also possess the intrinsic ability to phagocytize and kill K. pneumoniae intracellularly. Whereas the induction of autophagy promotes bacterial replication, inhibition of autophagy enhances the intracellular clearance of K. pneumoniae in Sca-1+ LMSCs during the early time of infection. Adoptive transfer of Sca-1+ LMSCs in K. pneumoniae_infected mice improved survival, reduced inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and pathological lesions in the lung, and enhanced bacterial clearance in the lung and in extrapulmonary organs. To our knowledge, these results together illustrate for the first time the protective role of LMSCs in bacterial pneumonia.","Rangasamy T., Ghimire L., Jin L., Le J., Periasamy S., Paudel S., Cai S., Jeyaseelan S.",10.4049/jimmunol.2000688,Journal Of Immunology
Acetic Acid Dressings Used To Treat Pseudomonas Colonised Burn Wounds: A Uk National Survey,"Introduction: Wound infection following burn injury can be clinically challenging to manage. Its presence in a thermally compromised patient can detrimentally affect the ability of the wound to heal leading not only to wound progression but ultimately contribute to a large part of the economic health burden expenditure in the National Health Service. Despite meticulous wound care and infection control measures the colonisation of burn wounds by bacterial pathogens has and continues to be the case. There has been a growing interest in the use of antimicrobial applications when managing localised burn wound infections due to a constantly increasing number of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Aim: To survey which antimicrobial dressings are currently being used across UK burns services when managing localised pseudomonas wound infections. Methods: We conducted a nationwide telephone survey of UK burns services during October 2019 to determine which topical antimicrobial agent was used to treat local pseudomonas burn wound infections. Results: Six burns services (31.6%) used acetic acid-soaked dressings, one of which alternates acetic acid with sodium hypochlorite solution. Silver-based dressings were also used by six burns services (31.6%) – again, one department alternates silver-based dressings with sodium hypochlorite solution. Betadine-soaked, gauze-based dressings were used across five burns services (26.3%) and the remaining two burns services (10.5%) used sodium hypochlorite solution and non-medicated dressings respectively. Conclusion: We identified a significant difference in the UK burns services’ approach to pseudomonas burn wound infections. Our literature review demonstrates that a daily dressing regime of 2.5–3% acetic acid is a well-tolerated treatment regime in burn patients and that it is in use in UK burns services. There are no current randomised controlled trials that evaluate the usage of acetic acid. The variation in usage suggests that there is scope for further study in order to develop evidence to generate a UK wide approach based on national standardised guidelines.","Nour S., Reid G., Sathanantham K., Mackie I.",10.1016/j.burns.2021.07.011,Burns
Tuning Antibacterial Efficacy Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa By Using Green Agnps In Chitosan Thin Films As A Plastic Alternative,"Nanotechnology advancements have facilitated the development of eco-friendly strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This study promotes a green method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing Eucalyptus globulus leaf extracts as an alternative to traditional colloidal AgNPs obtained through chemical synthesis, investigating their antibacterial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their impact on the expression of bacterial virulence factors (pyocyanin, pyoverdine, rhamnolipids). This work demonstrates that: i. while colloidal AgNPs showed ineffective up to 120 μM, green AgNPs had a bactericidal effect already at 20 μM, without impacting bacterial virulence factors at sub-inhibitory concentrations; ii. the polyphenolic shell surrounding green AgNPs could play a crucial role in the antibacterial mechanisms, with a pro-oxidant action confirmed by a greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)); iii. AgNPs improved the antibacterial properties of chitosan when incorporated into thin films. Consequently, an environmentally friendly nanocomposite film with antibacterial and antibiofilm properties was produced, which holds promise for application in food packaging to mitigate the emergence of microbial contamination in food products.","Villani S., De Matteis V., Calcagnile M., Cascione M., Pellegrino P., Vincenti L., Demitri C., Alifano P., Rinaldi R.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.138277,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
Antibacterial Activity Of Pakistani Beri Honey Compared With Silver Sulfadiazine On Infected Wounds: A Clinical Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial activity of Pakistani Beri honey in patients with infected wounds in comparison with silver sulfadiazine. METHOD: Inpatients with infected wounds at a tertiary care hospital were divided in to three equal-sized treatment groups. In Group A, patients were treated with non-Gamma irradiated Beri honey. In Group B, Gamma irradiated Beri honey was used, and in Group C silver sulfadiazine was used. Treatment was for a period of four weeks. Pus swabs were taken at day zero and weeks one and four of treatment. Bacteria were identified using the analytical profile index system API 20E, 20NE and API Staph and antimicrobial susceptibility was done as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2010 guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients with wounds (n=90) took part in the trial. Out of 90 wounds, 47% were post-traumatic and 37% were postoperative. Overall, average length, width and depth of Group A patients' wounds were significantly reduced (p<0.0001). Out of 144 pus swabs; 99 and 45 were Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci, respectively. Among these Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=25) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=38) were the major pathogens. Interestingly, bacterial load gradually decreased from baseline to week four due to non-Gamma irradiated Beri honey. Moreover, both the Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci displayed 100% resistance to commonly used antibiotics; the most effective drugs were carbapenem and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Pakistani Beri honey could be used as an alternative therapeutic option for the management of infected wounds.","Yousaf I., Ishaq I., Hussain M.B., Inaam S., Saleem S., Qamar M.U.",10.12968/jowc.2019.28.5.291,Journal Of Wound Care
Microplastics Increase Impact Of Treated Wastewater On Freshwater Microbial Community,"Plastic pollution is a major global concern with several million microplastic particles entering every day freshwater ecosystems via wastewater discharge. Microplastic particles stimulate biofilm formation (plastisphere) throughout the water column and have the potential to affect microbial community structure if they accumulate in pelagic waters, especially enhancing the proliferation of biohazardous bacteria. To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 (int1), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of int1 increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles. Likewise, the microbial community on microplastic was more similar to the original wastewater community with increasing microplastic concentrations. Our results show that microplastic particles indeed promote persistence of typical indicators of microbial anthropogenic pollution in natural waters, and substantiate that their removal from treated wastewater should be prioritised. Increasing microplastic concentrations allow the persistence of integrase 1 on the plastic pollutants.","Eckert E.M., Di Cesare A., Kettner M.T., Arias-Andres M., Fontaneto D., Grossart H.-P., Corno G.",10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.070,Environmental Pollution
"Different Effects Of Bio/Non-Degradable Microplastics On Sewage Sludge Compost Performance: Focusing On Antibiotic Resistance Genes, Virulence Factors And Key Metabolic Functions","Microplastics (MP) have aroused increasing concern due to the negative environmental impact. However, the impact of bio/non-biodegradable MPs on the sludge composting process has not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factors (VFs), and microbial community functions in sludge compost with the application of polylactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene (PP), using metagenomic sequencing. The findings indicated that both types of MPs could extend the thermophilic phase, enhance microbial activity, and inhibit the formation of humic acids. Compared to CK, the subtypes of ARGs decreased 4.22 % and 13.11 % in PLA and PP groups, respectively. But new ARGs emerged, particularly in the PLA group. The proportions of ARGs related to efflux and VFs associated with the adhesion system increased 1.62 %-2.27 % and 55.56 %-60.00 %, respectively, in MPs-added composts. The relative abundance of potential bacterial hosts (e.g., Psychrobacter) carrying multiple ARGs and VFs was much higher in PLA-added compost than in the other two. Moreover, PP facilitated denitrification process and PLA enhanced dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. Both types of MPs inhibited assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia but promoted inorganic nitrogen assimilation. This study broadens our understanding of the potential environmental risks posed by biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics on sludge compost and offers valuable insights for the management and application of compost products.","Liu X., Li H., Yang J., Yan S., Zhou Y., Jiang R., Li R., Wang M., Ren P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.137329,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Viral Diversity And Potential Environmental Risk In Microplastic At Watershed Scale: Evidence From Metagenomic Analysis Of Plastisphere,"Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a new vector for the long-distance transport of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of viral communities attached on MPs and their environmental risk are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the viral diversity and potential risk in five different MPs collected from the Beilun River based on metagenomic analysis. Nearly 2863 million raw reads were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in the identification of 1719 different species of viruses in MPs. Viruses in polypropylene (PP) displayed the highest diversity, with about 250 specific viruses detected. Source tracking of viruses in MPs by the fast expectation–maximization microbial source tracking method (FEAST) demonstrated that viruses in upstream and downstream MPs are two major sources of viruses in estuary. Furthermore, the MP-type-dependent potential environmental risk of viruses was significant based on both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) detected in viral metagenomes, and PP was confirmed with the highest potential environmental risk. This study reveals the high diversity and potential environmental risk of viruses in different MPs, and provides an important guidance for future environmental monitoring and understanding the potential risks associated with both viral transmission and MPs pollution.","Li R., Zhu L., Cui L., Zhu Y.-G.",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107146,Environment International
Selective Enrichment Of Bacterial Pathogens By Microplastic Biofilm,"Microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation. Here, we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates (rock and leaf) under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles, and ARG microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure. Network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community, but with lower average path length, network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles. Metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad-spectrum and distinctive resistome. Specifically, according to taxonomic annotation of ARG microbial hosts, two opportunisitic human pathogens (Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mendocina) and one plant pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae) were detected only in the microplastic biofilm, but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates. Our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for ARGs and pathogens to new environment in river water, generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health.","Wu X., Pan J., Li M., Li Y., Bartlam M., Wang Y.",10.1016/j.watres.2019.114979,Water Research
Non-Thermal Dielectric Barrier Discharge (Dbd) Effects On Proliferation And Differentiation Of Human Fibroblasts Are Primary Mediated By Hydrogen Peroxide,"The proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblast differentiation are crucial in wound healing and wound closure. Impaired wound healing is often correlated with chronic bacterial contamination of the wound area. A new promising approach to overcome wound contamination, particularly infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, is the topical treatment with non-thermal â€œcoldâ€ atmospheric plasma (CAP). Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) devices generate CAP containing active and reactive species, which have antibacterial effects but also may affect treated tissue/cells. Moreover, DBD treatment acidifies wound fluids and leads to an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide products, such as nitrite and nitrate, in the wound. Thus, in this paper, we addressed the question of whether DBD-induced chemical changes may interfere with wound healing-relevant cell parameters such as viability, proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of primary human fibroblasts. DBD treatment of 250 Îl buffered saline (PBS) led to a treatment time-dependent acidification (pH 6.7; 300 s) and coincidently accumulation of nitrite (~300 ÎM), nitrate (~1 mM) and H2O2 (~200 ÎM). Fibroblast viability was reduced by single DBD treatments (60â€""300 s; ~77â€""66%) or exposure to freshly DBD-treated PBS (60â€""300 s; ~75â€""55%), accompanied by prolonged proliferation inhibition of the remaining cells. In addition, the total number of myofibroblasts was reduced, whereas in contrast, the myofibroblast frequency was significantly increased 12 days after DBD treatment or exposure to DBD-treated PBS. Control experiments mimicking DBD treatment indicate that plasma-generated H2O2 was mainly responsible for the decreased proliferation and differentiation, but not for DBD-induced toxicity. In conclusion, apart from antibacterial effects, DBD/CAP may mediate biological processes, for example, wound healing by accumulation of H2O2. Therefore, a clinical DBD treatment must be well-balanced in order to avoid possible unwanted side effects such as a delayed healing process.","Balzer J., Heuer K., Demir E., Hoffmanns M.A., Baldus S., Fuchs P.C., Awakowicz P., Suschek C.V., Oplãnder C.",10.1371/journal.pone.0144968,Plos One
Metagenomic Analysis Reveals The Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Sludge Anaerobic Digestion,"Sewage sludge is recognized as both a source and a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Within an anaerobic digestion (AD) system, the presence of microplastics (MPs) has been observed to potentially facilitate the proliferation of these ARGs. Understanding the influence of MPs on microbial behavior and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) within the AD system is crucial for effectively managing the dissemination of ARGs in the environment. This study utilized metagenomic approaches to analyze the dynamics of various types of ARGs and potential microbial mechanisms under exposure to MPs during the AD process. The findings indicated that MPs in the AD process can enhance the proliferation of ARGs, with the extent of this enhancement increasing with the dosage of MPs: polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polylactic acid (PLA) MPs increased the abundance of ARGs in the anaerobic digestion system by up to 29.90%, 18.64%, and 14.15%, respectively. Additionally, the presence of MPs increased the relative abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the AD process. Network correlation analysis further revealed that plasmids represent the predominant category of MGEs involved in the HGT of ARGs. Propionibacterium and Alicycliphilus were identified as the primary potential hosts for these ARGs. The results of gene function annotation indicated that exposure to MPs led to an increased the relative abundance of genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in membrane permeability, ATP synthesis, and the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These genes play crucial roles in influencing the HGT of ARGs.","Li Z., Yuan D.",10.3390/toxics12120920,Toxics
Distribution And Major Driving Elements Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Soil-Vegetable System Under Microplastic Stress,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are both enriched in soil-vegetable systems as a consequence of the prolonged use of agricultural mulches. MPs can form unique bacterial communities and provide potential hosts for ARGs. Therefore, MPs stress may promote the spread of ARGs from soil to crops. Increasing ARGs pollution in soil-vegetable system. In our research, we investigated the distribution and major driving elements of antibiotic resistance genes in the soil-vegetable system under microplastic stress. The results showed that MPs treatment decreased the relative abundance of ARGs in non-rhizosphere soil. High concentrations of MPs promoted the enrichment of tetracycline antibiotic resistance genes in rhizosphere soil. MPs treatment promoted the enrichment of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in lettuce tissues, and the overall abundance of ARGs in root after 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % (w/w, dry weight) polyethylene (PE) administration was considerably higher compared to that in the untreated group (p < 0.05). At the same time, high PE concentrations promoted the spread of sulfa ARGs from root to leaf. MPs also impacted the bacterial communities in the soil-plant system, and the changes in ARGs as well as MGEs in each part of the soil-vegetable system were significantly correlated with the bacterial diversity index (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis and network analysis showed that bacterial communities and MGEs were the main drivers of ARGs variation in soil-lettuce systems.","Li N., Zheng N., Pan J., An Q., Li X., Sun S., Chen C., Zhu H., Li Z., Ji Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167619,Science Of The Total Environment
"A Holistic Review On Triclosan And Triclocarban Exposure: Epidemiological Outcomes, Antibiotic Resistance, And Health Risk Assessment","Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are antimicrobials that are widely applied in personal care products, textiles, and plastics. TCS and TCC exposure at low doses may disturb hormone levels and even facilitate bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In the post-coronavirus disease pandemic era, chronic health effects and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes associated with TCS and TCC exposure represent an increasing concern. This study sought to screen and review the exposure levels and sources and changes after the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, potential health outcomes, bacterial resistance and cross-resistance, and health risk assessment tools associated with TCS and TCC exposure. Daily use of antimicrobial products accounts for most observed associations between internal exposure and diseases, while secondary exposure at trace levels mainly lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The roles of altered gut microbiota in multi-system toxicities warrant further attention. Sublethal dose of TCC selects ARGs without obviously increasing tolerance to TCC. But TCS induce persistent TCS resistance and reversibly select antibiotic resistance, which highlights the benefits of minimizing its use. To derive reference doses (RfDs) for humans, more sensitive endpoints observed in populational studies need to be confirmed using toxicological tests. Additionally, the human equivalent dose is recommended to be incorporated into the health risk assessment to reduce uncertainty of extrapolation.","Zhang D., Lu S.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162114,Science Of The Total Environment
Extended-Spectrum-Beta-Lactamases And Carbapenemase-Producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae Isolated From Fresh Produce Farms In Different Governorates Of Egypt,"Background and Aim: Fresh produce farms represents a major source of concern since they are becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant. This study aimed to investigate t he occurrence of carbapenemase and extended-spectrum-betalactamases (ESBL) - producing genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from fresh produce farms in Egypt, irrigation water, and people working in these fields. Materials and Methods: One hundred tomatoes from typical farms were collected in plastic bags. The study also included 20 surface-water samples from different irrigation watersheds in fresh produce farms, as well as 50 feces samples from farmworkers. Suspected K. pneumoniae was grown on Eosin Methylene Blue agar for 24 h before being biochemically identified using the RapID ONE test. PCR was used to detect carbapenemase (blaKPC, blaOXA-48, and blaNDM) and ESBL (blaSHV, blaTEM, and blaCTX) expressing genes on isolates. Results: K. pneumoniae was identified in 30% of water and 10% of worker samples, while only one isolate was found in tomato samples. One of the six irrigation water isolates tested positive for carbapenem-resistant NDM. In contrast, two isolates tested positive for ESBL determinants, one of which was blaSHV and the other having both blaSHV and blaTEM genes. Two of the five K. pneumoniae isolates from farmworkers were positive for blaNDM, with one isolate also testing positive for blaSHV and blaTEM. The blaOXA-48 gene was also discovered in the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae tomato isolate used in this study. Conclusion: Carbapenemase- and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were found in fresh produce farms, implying that these resistance genes were being passed down to Egyptian consumers.","Elshafiee E.A., Kadry M., Nader S.M., Ahmed Z.S.",10.14202/vetworld.2022.1191-1196,Veterinary World

Nowadays, the environmental distribution, sources, and analysis methods and technologies of micro(nano)plastics have been well studied and recognized. Nevertheless, the role of micro(nano)plastic particles as vectors for attaching organisms is not fully understood. In this paper, the role of micro(nano)plastics as vectors, and their potential effects on the ecology are introduced. Micro(nano)plastics could 1) accelerate the diffusion of organisms in the environment, which may result in biological invasion; 2) increase the gene exchange between attached biofilm communities, causing the transfer of pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes; 3) enhance the rate of energy, material and information flow in the environment. Accordingly, the role of microplastics as vectors for organisms should be further evaluated in the future research.","Shen M., Zhu Y., Zhang Y., Zeng G., Wen X., Yi H., Ye S., Ren X., Song B.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.01.004,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Ecological Insights Into The Resilience Of Marine Plastisphere Throughout A Storm Disturbance,"Among numerous research about marine plastisphere, the community living on the surface of plastic debris, little attention was given to the ecological mechanisms governing prokaryotes compared to eukaryotes, and even less focused on their resilience in a changing climate with more storm prevalence. Our current research recruited an integrated approach involving community succession across temporal dimension, ecological mechanisms that govern the assembly, and resilience to environmental perturbations to highlight the ecology of different kingdoms in the plastisphere. Towards this goal, we examined the succession of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities on artificial plastic nets in a sidestream of seawater from the Gulf of Aqaba over 35 days. A robust local storm enabled investigation of the alterations before, during, and after this disturbance, aiming at the community's potential to recover. Data from 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing and microscopic analyses decrypted the plastisphere diversity, community assembly, and stochasticity, followed by further analyses of functional and co-occurrence networks for the prokaryotic group. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities underwent exact opposite ecological mechanisms. While determinism driven by a robust environmental selection dictated the prokaryotic community assembly, stochasticity prevailed when this condition was relaxed. Interestingly, resilience against disturbance was observed in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes. The decrease in compositional, functional diversity and network complexity in the prokaryotic community was reversed, presumably due to the niche specification process and high dispersal. Niche specification following perturbation was evident in some bacteria by selected functions associated with plastic degradation, stress response, and antibiotic resistance. On the contrary, eukaryotes decreased in diversity and were dominated by the commonly found Chlorophyta towards the later successional period. Novel findings on the ecology of marine plastisphere during perturbation encourage the integration of this aspect into prediction research.","Nguyen D., Masasa M., Ovadia O., Guttman L.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159775,Science Of The Total Environment
Rapid Real-Time Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing With Electrical Sensing On Plastic Microchips With Printed Electrodes,"Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing is important for efficient and timely therapeutic decision making. Due to globally spread bacterial resistance, the efficacy of antibiotics is increasingly being impeded. Conventional antibiotic tests rely on bacterial culture, which is time-consuming and can lead to potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescription and up-front broad range of antibiotic use. There is an urgent need to develop point-of-care platform technologies to rapidly detect pathogens, identify the right antibiotics, and monitor mutations to help adjust therapy. Here, we report a biosensor for rapid (<90 min), real time, and label-free bacteria isolation from whole blood and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Target bacteria are captured on flexible plastic-based microchips with printed electrodes using antibodies (30 min), and its electrical response is monitored in the presence and absence of antibiotics over an hour of incubation time. We evaluated the microchip with Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as clinical models with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, daptomycin, gentamicin, and methicillin antibiotics. The results are compared with the current standard methods, i.e. bacteria viability and conventional antibiogram assays. The technology presented here has the potential to provide precise and rapid bacteria screening and guidance in clinical therapies by identifying the correct antibiotics for pathogens.","Safavieh M., Pandya H.J., Venkataraman M., Thirumalaraju P., Kanakasabapathy M.K., Singh A., Prabhakar D., Chug M.K., Shafiee H.",10.1021/acsami.6b16571,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Microplastics Deteriorate The Removal Efficiency Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Aerobic Sludge Digestion,"Sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is considered to be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can be efficiently removed by sludge treatment processes, e.g., aerobic sludge digestion. However, recent studies report microplastics, which also accumulate in sludge, may serve as carriers for ARGs. In the presence of microplastics, whether ARGs can still be efficiently destroyed by aerobic sludge digestion remains to be urgently investigated. In this study, the fate of ARGs during aerobic digestion was investigated with and without the addition of three prevalent categories of (i.e., polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)). Nine ARGs and class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) that represents the horizontal transfer potential of ARGs were tested in this study. Compared with the control, the ARGs removal efficiency decreased by 129.6%, 137.0%, and 227.6% with the presence of PVC, PE, and PET, respectively, although a negligible difference was observed with their solids reduction efficiencies. The abundance of potential bacterial hosts of ARGs and intI1 increased in the reactors with the addition of microplastics, suggesting that microplastics potentially selectively enriched bacterial hosts and promoted the horizontal transfer of ARGs during aerobic sludge digestion. These may have contributed to the deteriorated ARGs removal efficiency. This study demonstrated that microplastics in sludge would decrease the ARGs removal efficiency in aerobic digestion process, potentially leading to more ARGs entering the local environment during sludge disposal or utilization.","Zhang Z., Liu H., Wen H., Gao L., Gong Y., Guo W., Wang Z., Li X., Wang Q.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149344,Science Of The Total Environment
Constructed Wetlands As Neglected Fixed Source Of Microplastics And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Natural Water Bodies?,"The pollution status and the harm caused by microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic ecosystems have been a growing concern. The presence of microplastics could accelerate the transfer and spread of ARGs. Before sewage reaches natural water bodies, microplastics and ARGs need to be eliminated through specific processes. Constructed wetlands are currently an effective and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment process. Research has shown significant effectiveness in removing microplastics and ARGs. Microplastics and ARGs can be removed through processes such as adsorption, capture, adhesion, and biodegradation. However, long-term continuous operation could lead to constructed wetlands becoming significant reservoirs of microplastics and ARGs. Inflow loads and seasonal variations in constructed wetlands may result in the reintroduction of persistent microplastics and ARGs into the receiving water body, establishing the constructed wetland as a continuous source of these pollutants in the receiving water body. The key to the widespread application of constructed wetlands lies in solving this challenging problem. Therefore, although constructed wetlands serve as a green strategy for removing microplastics and ARGs, there are still many gaps in our knowledge. Based on the current accumulation of microplastics and ARGs in constructed wetlands, this paper summarizes the removal of microplastics and ARGs in existing constructed wetlands and explores the interaction between them. Additionally, it proposes suggestions for optimizing the process and improving the reliability of monitoring microplastics and ARGs in sewage.","Zhao Y., Jin R., Chen Y., Zhang J., Tao S., Liu S., Shen M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166474,Science Of The Total Environment
"Spatial Turnover Of Core And Occasional Bacterial Taxa In The Plastisphere From A Plateau River, China","Plastic surfaces in the environment are a comparatively new niche for microbial colonization, also known as the “plastisphere”. However, our understanding of the core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere is limited. Here, environmental plastic, water, and sediment samples were collected from 10 sites in a plateau river (Lhasa River, China) in September of 2019. The composition and spatial turnover of core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere were revealed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared with water and sediment. The results indicated that deterministic processes dominated the habitat specialization that shaped the formation of core and occasional taxa in the plastisphere, water, and sediment of the Lhasa River because the decline in zeta diversity in the plastisphere, water, and sediment was more fitted to a power-law form rather than an exponential form. Proteobacteria (65.9%), Bacteroidetes (16.0%), and Cyanobacteria (11.7%) dominated the plastic core taxa. Core taxa rather than occasional taxa in the plastisphere had a lower (21.7%) proportion of OTUs and a higher (81.7%) proportion of average relative abundance than water and sediment, which were dominant in plastic bacterial communities. The spatial turnover of core and occasional bacterial taxa in the plastisphere was governed by abiotic as well as biotic factors. Specifically, the spatial turnover of core taxa in the plastisphere with high connectivity but low functional redundancy was easily affected by geographical distance, altitude, and heavy metals. Furthermore, strong drug resistance was found in the spatially persistent core taxa in the plastisphere. This study provides empirical support for the spatial turnover (species variation) and potential ecological mechanisms of bacterial communities in the plastisphere from river ecosystems.","Zhang W., Jiang C., Chen L., Bhagwat G., Thava P., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156179,Science Of The Total Environment
Size-Dependent Effects Of Microplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Genes Fate In Wastewater Treatment Systems: The Role Of Changed Surface Property And Microbial Assemblages In A Continuous Exposure Mode,"Microplastics (MPs) were continuously transported to wastewater treatment systems and accumulated in sludge constantly, potentially affecting systems function and co-occurrent contaminants fate. However, previous studies were based on acute exposure of MPs, which could not reflect the dynamics of MPs accumulation. Herein, this study firstly raised a more realistic method to evaluate the practical impacts of MPs on systems purification efficiency and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) fate. Continuous exposure of MPs did not pose negative effects on nutrients removal, but significantly changed the occurrence patterns of ARGs. ARGs abundances increased by 42.8 % and 54.3 % when exposed to millimeter-size MPs (mm-MPs) polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, but increased by 31.3 % and 39.4 % to micron-size MPs (μm-MPs), respectively. Thus, mm-MPs posed severer effects on ARGs than μm-MPs. Further, mm-MPs surface properties were obviously altered after long-term exposure (higher specific surface area and O-containing species), which benefited microbes attachment. More importantly, more taxa linkages and changed topological properties (higher average degree and average weight) of co-occurrent network were observed in sludge with mm-MPs than with μm-MPs, as well as totally different potential host bacteria of ARGs. Rough surface of MPs and closer relations between ARGs and bacteria taxa contributed to the propagation of ARGs, which accounted for the observed higher ARGs abundances of mm-MPs. This study demonstrated that long-term accumulation of MPs in wastewater treatment systems affected ARGs fate, and mm-MPs caused severer risk due to their enrichment of ARGs. The results would promote the understanding of MPs real environmental behavior and influences.","Wang Z., Su Y., Zhu J., Wu D., Xie B.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158264,Science Of The Total Environment
Acinetobacter Baumannii Quorum-Sensing Signalling Molecule Induces The Expression Of Drug-Resistance Genes,"Quorum-sensing signalling molecules such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) enable certain Gram-negative bacteria to respond to environmental changes through behaviours, such as biofilm formation and flagellar movement. The present study aimed to identify Acinetobacter baumannii AHLs and assess their influence on antibiotic resistance. A clinical isolate of A. baumannii strain S (AbS) was collected from the wound of a burn patient and high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem quadrupole or quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify AbS AHLs. Antibiotic sensitivity was assessed in an AHL-deficient AbS mutant (AbS-M), and the expression of drug-resistance genes in the presence of meropenem in AbS, AbS-M and AbS-M treated with the AHL N-3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (N-3-OH-C(12)-HSL). AbS-M was more sensitive to meropenem and piperacillin than wild-type AbS, but resistance was restored by supplementation with N-3-OH-C(12)-HSL. In addition, meropenem-treated AbS-M expressed lower levels of the drug-resistance genes oxacillinase 51, AmpC, AdeA and AdeB; treatment with N-3-OH-C(12)-HSL also restored the expression of these genes. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that N-3-OH-C(12)-HSL may be involved in regulating the expression of drug-resistance genes in A. baumannii. Therefore, this quorum-sensing signalling molecule may be an important target for treating multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections.","Dou Y., Song F., Guo F., Zhou Z., Zhu C., Xiang J., Huan J.",10.3892/mmr.2017.6528,Molecular Medicine Reports
Microplastic And Antibiotic Proliferated The Colonization Of Specific Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Phycosphere Of Chlorella Pyrenoidosa,"Despite that the phycosphere was an important niche for the proliferation of various bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the factors that affect the colonization of bacteria and ARGs in the phycosphere are still poorly understood. In this study, sterile C. pyrenoidosa co-cultured with bacteria from different sources and provided with polylactic acid microplastic (PLA MPs) and florfenicol (FF) was examined. Results showed that bacteria promoted the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and increased its chlorophyll contents. PLA MPs and FF also showed positive effects on C. pyrenoidosa due to the “Hormesis effect”. The occurrence of bacteria in the phycosphere was significantly affected by their sources and the addition of PLA MPs and FF. However, the core microbiota of the phycosphere in each group was similar. Additionally, PLA MPs and FF proliferated the abundance of phenicol-related ARGs (especially floR) and mobile genetic elements in the phycosphere. Notably, PLA MPs and FF enhanced the abundance of Flavobacterium, a potential host of ARGs. Our results highlighted the important roles of bacteria in microalgae and demonstrated exogenous pollutants could promote the spread of ARGs between surrounding environments and the phycosphere, which provide new insights into the occurrence and spread of ARGs in the phycosphere.","Jia J., Liu Q., Wu C.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131618,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Responses Of Performance, Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Bacterial Communities Of Partial Nitrification System To Polyamide Microplastics","Polyamide (PA), a prevalent microplastics (MPs), is often collected from wastewater treatment plants. However, the responses of partial nitrification system to PA MPs are unclear. The short-term and long-term effect of PA MPs on the partial nitrification system was slight, but the ammonia oxidation rate decreased slowly with the increase of PA MPs concentration. Meantime, the PA MPs addition could decrease the microbial diversity, alter microbial community structure of the system and facilitate the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including fabI, intI1 and Tn916/1545. Correlation analysis and network analysis indicated that Ferruginibacter, Hyphomicrobium, Terrimonas, Brevundimonas and Plasticicumulans in the system might be the dominant hosts of ARGs. In addition, oligotyping analysis indicated not all oligotypes of the relevant genus showed positive correlation with ARGs. In general, PA MPs had almost no effect on performance but altered community structure and increased ARGs spread risk of the partial nitrification system.","Cui Y., Gao J., Zhang D., Li D., Dai H., Wang Z., Zhao Y.",10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125767,Bioresource Technology
Interaction Between Microplastic Biofilm Formation And Antibiotics: Effect Of Microplastic Biofilm And Its Driving Mechanisms On Antibiotic Resistance Gene,"As two pollutants with similar transport pathways, microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics (ATs) inevitably co-exist in water environments, and their interaction has become a topic of intense research interest for scholars over the past few years. This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the current interaction between MPs and ATs, in particular, the role played by biofilm developed MPs (microplastic biofilm). A summary of the formation process of microplastic biofilm and its unique microbial community structure is presented in the paper. The formation of microplastic biofilm can enhance the adsorption mechanisms of ATs on primary MPs. Moreover, microplastic biofilm system is a diverse and vast reservoir of genetic material, and this paper reviews the mechanisms by which microplastics with biofilm drive the production of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the processes that selectively enrich for more ARGs. Meanwhile, the enrichment of ARGs may lead to the development of microbial resistance and the gradual loss of the antimicrobial effect of ATs. The transfer pathways of ARGs affected by microplastic biofilm are outlined, and ARGs dependent transfer of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) is mainly through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, the ecological implications of the interaction between microplastic biofilm and ATs and perspectives for future research are reviewed. This review contributes to a new insight into the aquatic ecological environmental risks and the fate of contaminants (MPs, ATs), and is of great significance for controlling the combined pollution of these two pollutants.","Zheng Z., Huang Y., Liu L., Wang L., Tang J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132099,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Effects And Mechanism Of Microplastics On Abundance And Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In The Environment - A Critical Review,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging pollutants that are widely present in the environment, and are affected by microplastics (MPs). The coexistence of MPs and ARGs enhances their abundance and transmission ability, thereby increasing their environmental hazard. This study summarized the effects of MPs on the abundance and transmission of ARGs. First, the effects of MPs on ARGs in aquatic, terrestrial, atmospheric, and animal intestinal environments were analyzed. Furthermore, factors that affect the enrichment and transfer ability of MPs, including MPs properties, human activities, environmental factors, and other pollutants, were discussed. Previous studies mainly focused on the abundance changes, propagation and diffusion of ARGs on MPs, however, the possible mechanism of these changes on ARGs caused by MPs has not been fully studied, which also leads to many explanations that are not appropriate. Therefore, in the fourth section, the detailed mechanism of MPs on abundance and transfer of ARGs is systematically discussed. As the core innovation in this article, it fills the gap that has been to be supplemented in recent years. Finally, the research challenges and prospects of the effects of MPs on the abundance and spread of ARGs are proposed in the hope that this review will be helpful to better understand the environmental risks and mechanisms of MPs on ARGs.","Liu X., Wei H., Ahmad S., Wang R., Gao P., Chen J., Song Y., Liu C., Ding N., Tang J.",10.1080/10643389.2024.2368758,Critical Reviews In Environmental Science And Technology
Microplastics Are A Hotspot For Antibiotic Resistance Genes: Progress And Perspective,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics in the environment are of great public concern due to their potential risk to human health. Microplastics can form distinct bacterial communities and absorb pollutants from the surrounding environment, which provide potential hosts and exert possible selection pressure of ARGs. We provide a practical evaluation of the scientific literature regarding this issue. The occurrence and transport of ARGs on microplastics in wastewater treatment plants, aquatic, terrestrial, and air environments were summarized. Selective enrichment of ARGs and antibiotic resistance bacteria on microplastics have been confirmed in different environments. Aggregates may be crucial to understand the behavior and transport of ARGs on microplastics, especially in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. Microplastics could be a carrier of ARGs between the environment and animals. Accumulation of pollutants and dense bacterial communities on microplastics provide favorable conditions for higher transfer rate and evolution of ARGs. More studies are still needed to understand the enrichment, transport, and transfer of ARGs on microplastics and provide a fundamental basis for evaluating their exposure health risk to humans.","Liu Y., Liu W., Yang X., Wang J., Lin H., Yang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145643,Science Of The Total Environment
Silver Nanoparticles Facilitate Phage-Borne Resistance Gene Transfer In Planktonic And Microplastic-Attached Bacteria,"The spread of bacteriophage-borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) poses a realistic threat to human health. Nanomaterials, as important emerging pollutants, have potential impacts on ARGs dissemination in aquatic environments. However, little is known about its role in transductive transfer of ARGs mediated by bacteriophage in the presence of microplastics. Therefore, this study comprehensively investigated the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the transfer of bacteriophage-encoded ARGs in planktonic Escherichia coli and microplastic-attached biofilm. AgNPs exposure facilitated the phage transduction in planktonic and microplastic-attached bacteria at ambient concentration of 0.1 mg/L. Biological binding mediated by phage-specific recognition, rather than physical aggregation conducted by hydrophilicity and ζ-potential, dominated the bacterial adhesion of AgNPs. The aggregated AgNPs in turn resulted in elevated oxidative stress and membrane destabilization, which promoted the bacteriophage infection to planktonic bacteria. AgNPs exposure could disrupt colanic acid biosynthesis and then reduce the thickness of biofilm on microplastics, contributing to the transfer of phage-encoded ARGs. Moreover, the roughness of microplastics also affected the performance of AgNPs on the transductive transfer of ARGs in biofilms. This study reveals the compound risks of nanomaterials and microplastics in phage-borne ARGs dissemination and highlights the complexity in various environmental scenarios.","Zhang Q., Zhou H., Jiang P., Wu L., Xiao X.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133942,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Travertine Deposition Rather Than Tourism Activity Is The Primary Contributor To The Microplastic Risks In Alpine Karst Lakes,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as anthropogenic vectors to form plastisphere, facilitating microbiome colonization and pathogenic dissemination, thus contributing to environmental and health crises across various ecosystems. However, a knowledge gap persists regarding MPs risks and their driving factors in certain unique and vulnerable ecosystems, such as Karst travertine lakes, some of which are renowned World Natural Heritage Sites under ever-increasing tourism pressure. We hypothesized that tourism activities serve as the most important factor of MPs pollution, whereas intrinsic features, including travertine deposition can exacerbate potential environmental risks. Thus, metagenomic approaches were employed to investigate the geographical distribution of the microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and their combined environmental risks in Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong, two famous tourism destinations in Southwest China. The plastisphere risks were higher in Huanglong, contradicting our hypothesis that Jiuzhaigou would face more crucial antibiotic risks due to its higher tourist activities. Specifically, the levels of Lipopolysaccharide Lewis and fosD increased by sevenfold and 20-fold, respectively, from upstream to downstream in Huanglong, whereas in Jiuzhaigou, no significant accrual was observed. Structural equation modeling results showed that travertine deposition was the primary contributor to MPs risks in alpine karstic lakes. Our findings suggest that tourism has low impact on MPs risks, possibly because of proper management, and that travertine deposition might act as an MPs hotspot, emphasizing the importance of considering the unique aspects of travertine lakes in mitigating MPs pollution and promoting the sustainable development of World Natural Heritage Sites.","Zeng H., Wang Y., Zhao Z., Zhu D., Xia H., Wei Y., Kuang P., An D., Chen K., Li R., Lei Y., Sun G.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135192,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Evaluation Of Bacterial Biofilm Removal Properties Of Medster 2000 Cold Sterilant On Different Materials,"We studied the antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties of MEDSTER 2000, a pH neutral biodegradable mixed acidic peroxide disinfectant belonging to the class IIb medical device which has been designed for decontamination and cold sterilization of hospital instruments. The broth microdilution method was used to define the antibacterial activity against planktonic form of both classified bacteria and antibiotic resistant strains of clinical source, whereas effectiveness toward their biofilm was determined on mature biofilm, grown both on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. The results showed that for the planktonic form the antibacterial activity of MEDSTER 2000 was already observed after 10 min at the lowest concentration (0.1%), and this effect was not exposure-and/or concentration-dependent. After the same time of exposure at the concentration of 2% the disinfectant was able to completely eradicate all tested bacteria grown in sessile form on both surfaces, with a greater than 6 log CFU/cm(2) reduction in viable cells. This result is supported by the microscope observation by crystal violet and live/dead assays. For the high antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability emerged, MEDSTER 2000 could represent a new and more effective approach for semicritical devices that need a high-level disinfection and could not sustain the process of heat sterilization.","Iseppi R., Feminò R., Sabia C., Messi P.",10.1007/5584_2020_542,Advances In Experimental Medicine And Biology
Alteration In Microbial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Mediated By Microplastics During Wastewater Ultraviolet Disinfection,"Microplastics (MPs) could be as a vector to colonize microorganisms and antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in surface water. However, little information is known regarding their changes by the presence of MPs in wastewater treatment. Here, the effects of different concentrations and sizes of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on the distribution and removal of microbial communities and ARGs under ultraviolet disinfection of urban sewage have been systematically studied. Results showed that the presence of MPs altered abundance and functions of microorganisms in wastewater, despite different effects on different types of microorganisms. The most abundant ARGs in original disinfection tank sewage was rpoB2 (6.34%). A certain concentration range of MPs can improve the ability of specific types of ARGs in the UV disinfection process. Compared to the system without PSMPs, the content of Deinococcus-Thermus and Bacteroidetes phylum increased, while Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phylum decreased in the presence of MPs. The microbial functions, especially the genetic information processing and metabolism were altered by the presence of PSMPs. In addition, PSMPs altered the content of ARGs, where the contents of OXA-182 and ErmH were increased, while adeF and ANT3-Iic were decreased. PSMPs also decreased the free ARB content in wastewater by providing colonization sites. The UV disinfection efficiency of microorganisms and ARGs was also intervened by PSMPs since they provided colonization sites and increased the water turbidity. The findings indicated that PSMPs altered the distribution and removal of microbial community and ARGs in ultraviolet disinfection of wastewater, highlighting the combined risks.","Yang Z., Liu P., Wei H., Li H., Li J., Qiu X., Ding R., Guo X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153918,Science Of The Total Environment
The Resistance Change And Stress Response Mechanisms Of Chlorine-Resistant Bacteria Under Microplastic Stress In Drinking Water Distribution System,"The presence of both chlorine-resistant bacteria (CRB) and microplastics (MPs) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) poses a threat to water quality and human health. However, the risk of CRB bio evolution under the stress of MPs remains unclear. In this study, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were selected to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and it was clear that MPs had the risk of carrying pollutants into DWDS and releasing them. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility test and disinfection experiment confirmed that MPs could enhance the resistance of CRB to antibiotics and disinfectants. Bacteria epigenetic resistance mechanisms were approached from multiple perspectives, including physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as molecular regulatory networks. When MPs enter DWDS, CRB could attach to the surface of MPs and directly interact with both MPs and the antibiotics they release. This attachment process promoted changes in the composition and content of extracellular polymers (EPS) within cells, enhanced surface hydrophobicity, stimulated oxidative stress function, and notably elevated the relative abundance of certain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study elucidates the mechanism by which MPs alter the intrinsic properties of CRB, providing valuable insights into the effective avoidance of biological risks to water quality during CRB evolution.","Zhang J., Ma W., Li Y., Zhong D., Zhou Z., Ma J.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124331,Environmental Pollution
Antimicrobial Resistance And The Spectrum Of Pathogens In Dental And Oral-Maxillofacial Infections In Hospitals And Dental Practices In Germany,"Data on microbiological profiles in odontogenic infections are scarce. This study aimed to analyze the spectrum of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates from dental and oral-maxillofacial clinical settings in Germany. We analyzed 20,645 clinical isolates (dental practices: n = 5,733; hospitals: n = 14,912) from patients with odontogenic infections using data (2012–2019) from the German Antimicrobial-Resistance-Surveillance (ARS) system. A total of 224 different species from 73 genera were found in clinical isolates from dental practices, and 329 different species from 97 genera were identified in isolates from hospital patients. In both hospitals and dental practices Streptococcus spp. (33 and 36%, respectively) and Staphylococcus spp. (21 and 12%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. In Streptococcus spp. isolates from hospitals, penicillin and aminopenicillin resistance proportions were 8.0% (95%CI 4.7–14.9%) and 6.9% (95%CI 4.7–9.9%), respectively. Substantially lower resistance proportions of penicillin and aminopenicillin were observed in dental practices [2.6% (95%CI 1.4–4.7%) and 2.1% (95%CI 1.1–4.0%), respectively]. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospital patients methicillin resistance proportions were 12.0% (95%CI 9.7–14.8%), which was higher than in isolates from dental practices (5.8% (95%CI 4.1–8.1%)]. High clindamycin and macrolide resistance proportions (>17%) were observed in Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. In Klebsiella spp. isolates carbapenem resistance proportions were <1%. In sum, substantial antibiotic resistance was observed in isolates from odontogenic infections, which calls for strengthened efforts in antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention and control measures in both hospitals and dental practices.","Meinen A., Reuss A., Willrich N., Feig M., Noll I., Eckmanns T., Al-Nawas B., Markwart R.",10.3389/fmicb.2021.676108,Frontiers In Microbiology
"Microplastics, Heavy Metals, Antibiotics, And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Recirculating Aquaculture Systems","The growing concerns over food safety and pollutants, especially emerging contaminants like microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, have attracted considerable research attention. This paper provides a comprehensive review of MPs, heavy metals, antibiotics, and ARGs within Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), exploring their occurrence, characteristics, sources, impacts, removal strategies, and interactions. MPs are found in varying concentrations in RAS, especially in fish tissues, raising concerns about fish health. Heavy metals in RAS, originating from feed, pipe corrosion, and make-up water, accumulate, posing risks to fish and necessitating stringent control measures. Antibiotics persist in RAS water and sediment, contributing to ARGs, posing a threat to both fish and human health. Research gaps persist in the removal of MPs, efficient heavy metals control, and addressing antibiotics and ARGs pollution in RAS. Controlling MPs is crucial due to their role as ideal carriers, potential reservoirs, and hotspots for other pollutants, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to mitigate environmental and health risks.

Selective Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes And Pathogens On Polystyrene Microplastics In Landfill Leachate,"Landfill leachate is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics (MPs). However, the enrichment characteristics of ARGs on MPs and the effect of MPs' presence on ARGs in surrounding leachates are little studied. Therefore, we investigated the differences of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), bacterial communities and pathogens on polystyrene MPs, in MPs-surrounding leachate and in control (leachate with the absence of MPs). The results revealed that ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs, which was similar in three types of leachate environments. The genes strB and bla(TEM) were maximally enriched and mefA, ermB, tetM and tetQ were slightly enriched on MPs, and the degree of ARGs enrichment increased with time during the 60 days of the experiment. Furthermore, compared to the leachate, MPs were observed to have the higher abundances of MGEs and distinct bacterial communities, both of which were closely associated with ARGs on MPs. Pathogens were distinct and more abundant on MPs compared to that in leachate, and 11 pathogens were identified as potential hosts for ARGs on MPs. Additionally, the presence of MPs (500 mg/L) induced few changes in ARGs' abundances, MGEs' abundances and bacterial communities in MP-surrounding leachate within 60 days. Overall, this study suggested that MPs could selectively enrich ARGs and pathogens from the surrounding environments, which promoted the understanding of the combined pollution properties of MPs and ARGs.","Shi J., Wu D., Su Y., Xie B.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142775,Science Of The Total Environment
Uv-Aging Reduces The Effects Of Biodegradable Microplastics On Soil Sulfamethoxazole Degradation And Sul Genes Development,"In recent years, the biodegradable plastics has extensively used in industry, agriculture, and daily life. Herein, the effects of two biodegradable microplastics (BMPs), poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), on soil sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation and sul genes development were comparatively studied based on the type, dosage, and state. The addition of virgin BMPs significantly increased soil DOC following a sequential order PBAT > PHA and high dose > low dose. Meanwhile virgin PBAT significantly reduced soil pH. In general, the addition of BMPs not only promoted soil SMX degradation but also increased the abundance of sul genes, with an exception that pH reduction in virgin PBAT inhibited the proliferation of sul genes. The driving effects of BMPs on soil microbial diversity following the same order as that on DOC. Specific bacteria stimulated by BMPs, such as Arthrobacter and two genera affiliated with phylum TM7, accounted for the accelerated degradation of SMX. Intriguingly, UV-aging hindered the release of DOC from BMPs and the reduction in pH, mitigated the stimulation of microbial communities, and ultimately reduced the promotion effect of BMPs on SMX degradation and sul genes proliferation. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to the proliferation risk of ARGs in the environment affected by BMPs and UV-aging can be employed sometimes to reduce this risk.","Sun X., Tian S., You L., Huang X., Su J.-Q.",10.1016/j.jes.2024.03.040,Journal Of Environmental Sciences (China)
Metagenomic Insight Into The Enrichment Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Activated Sludge Upon Exposure To Nanoplastics,"Activated sludge is an important reservoir for the co-occurring emerging contaminants including nanoplastics (NPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the impacts and potential mechanisms of NPs on the fate of ARGs in activated sludge are not fully understood. Herein, we used metagenomic approach to investigate the responses of ARGs, host bacteria, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and functional genes to polystyrene (PS) NPs at environmentally relevant (0.5 mg/L) and high stress concentrations (50 mg/L) in activated sludge. The results showed that 0.5 and 50 mg/L PS NPs increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the activated sludge by 58.68% and 46.52%, respectively (p < 0.05). Host tracking analysis elucidated that the hosts of ARGs were significantly enriched by PS NPs (p < 0.05), with Proteobacteria being the predominant host bacteria. Additionally, the occurrence of new ARGs hosts and the enrichment of MGEs and functional genes (i.e., genes related to SOS response, cell membrane permeability, and secretion system, etc.) indicated that PS NPs promoted horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. Finally, path modeling analysis revealed that the proliferation of ARGs caused by PS NPs was primarily attributed to the enhancement of HGT and the enrichment of host bacteria. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the spread risk of ARGs in activated sludge under NPs pollution.","Song J., Huang Z., Gao Y., Wang W., Guo G., Duan Y., Zhou S., Tang Z.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125260,Environmental Pollution
"P, N, And C-Related Functional Genes In Sbr System Promoted Antibiotics Resistance Gene Transmission Under Polystyrene Microplastics Stress","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important sinks of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). Information regarding connections between functional modules of WWTPs and spread of ARGs under MPs stress is still lacking. In this study, correlations between P-, N-, and C-related functional genes and ARGs in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system were evaluated under polystyrene (PS) MPs stress. Total P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in effluent showed no significant changes under 0.5–50 mg L(−1) PS MPs stress within 32 cycle treatment periods of SBR, while 0.5 mg L(−1) PS MPs affected the N cycling process. PS MPs (0.5–50 mg L(−1)) promoted the richness and diversity of microbial community in SBR, and the denitrification process was exuberant. PS MPs with a low dosage (0.5–5 mg L(−1)) enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promoted expression levels of functional genes related to C fixation, C degradation, P cycling, and N cycling. Simultaneously, aac(3)-II, bla(TEM)-1, and tetW increased by 27.13%, 38.36%, and 9.57% under low dosages of PS MPs stress; more importantly, the total absolute abundance of intI1 nearly doubled. 78.4% of these P-, N-, and C-related functional genes were positively correlated with intI1, thus favoring transmission of ARGs. This study firstly disclosed the underlying correlations between functional modules of WWTPs and spread of ARGs under MPs stress.","Ren Z., Guo H., Jin H., Wang Y., Zhang G., Zhou J., Qu G., Sun Q., Wang T.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.119884,Water Research
Exploring The Potential Of Isorhapontigenin: Attenuating Staphylococcus Aureus Virulence Through Mgra-Mediated Regulation,"The emerging prevalence of drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates underscores the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies due to the declining effectiveness of traditional antibiotics in clinical settings. MgrA, a key virulence regulator in S. aureus, orchestrates the expression of numerous virulence factors. Here, we report the discovery of isorhapontigenin, a methoxylated analog of resveratrol, as a potential anti-virulence agent against S. aureus. Isorhapontigenin effectively inhibits the hemolytic activity of S. aureus in a non-bactericidal manner. Additionally, it significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of S. aureus and impairs its ability to survive in macrophages. Mechanistically, isorhapontigenin modulates the expression of virulence factors, dose-dependently downregulating hla and upregulating the MgrA-regulated gene spa. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that isorhapontigenin inhibits the binding of MgrA to the hla promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Thermal shift assays confirmed the direct interaction between isorhapontigenin and the MgrA protein. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that isorhapontigenin significantly reduced the area of skin abscesses and improved survival in a pneumonia model while decreasing bacterial burden and inflammation in the lungs. In conclusion, isorhapontigenin holds potential as a candidate drug for further development as an anti-virulence agent for treating S. aureus infections. IMPORTANCE The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains presents a formidable challenge to public health, necessitating novel approaches in combating these pathogens. Traditional antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective, leading to a pressing need for innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, targeting virulence factors that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections offers a promising alternative to circumvent resistance mechanisms. The discovery of isorhapontigenin as an inhibitor of S. aureus virulence represents a significant advance in anti-virulence therapy.","Yuan L., Xi H., Luo Z., Liu M.-F., Chen Q., Zhu Q., Zhao R., Sheng Y.-Y.",10.1128/msphere.00317-24,Msphere
Microplastics Exhibit Accumulation And Horizontal Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Although the fates of microplastics (0.1–5 mm) in marine environments and freshwater are increasingly studied, little is known about their vector effect in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Previous studies have evaluated the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on microplastics, but there is no direct evidence for the selection and horizontal transfer of ARGs on different microplastics in WWTPs. Here, we show biofilm formation as well as bacterial community and ARGs in these biofilms grown on four kinds of microplastics via incubation in the aerobic and anaerobic tanks of a WWTP. Microplastics showed differential capacities for bacteria and ARGs enrichment, differing from those of the culture environment. Furthermore, ARGs in microplastic biofilms were horizontally transferred at frequencies higher than those in water samples in both tanks. Therefore, microplastics in WWTPs can act as substrates for horizontal transfer of ARGs, potentially causing a great harm to the ecological environment and adversely affecting human health.","Feng Y., Sun J.-W., Shi W.-W., Duan J.-L., Sun X.-D., Feng L.-J., Wang Q., Gan Y.-D., Yuan X.-Z.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117632,Journal Of Environmental Management
Low-Density Polyethylene Enhances The Disturbance Of Microbiome And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Transfer In Soil-Earthworm System Induced By Pyraclostrobin,"Non-antibiotic chemicals in farmlands, including microplastics (MPs) and pesticides, have the potential to influence the soil microbiome and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite this, there is limited understanding of the combined effects of MPs and pesticides on microbial communities and ARGs transmission in soil ecosystems. In this study, we observed that low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastic enhance the accumulation of pyraclostrobin in earthworms, resulting in reduced weight and causing severe oxidative damage. Analysis of 16 S rRNA amplification revealed that exposure to pyraclostrobin and/or LDPE disrupts the microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels, leading to reduced alpha diversity in both the soil and earthworm gut. Furthermore, co-exposure to LDPE and pyraclostrobin increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the soil and earthworm gut by 2.15 and 1.34 times, respectively, compared to exposure to pyraclostrobin alone. It correlated well with the increasing relative abundance of genera carrying ARGs. Our findings contribute novel insights into the impact of co-exposure to MPs and pesticides on soil and earthworm microbiomes, highlighting their role in promoting the transfer of ARGs. This knowledge is crucial for managing the risk associated with the dissemination of ARGs in soil ecosystems.","Zhang Y., Qin K., Liu C.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133459,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Polystyrene Microplastics Impact The Occurrence Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Earthworms By Size-Dependent Toxic Effects,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two classes of emerging and prevalent contaminants in terrestrial environments. To date, effects of MPs on the occurrence of ARGs in terrestrial invertebrates remain uncertain. Here we exposed earthworms to a soil amended with polystyrene MPs at two environmentally relevant concentrations to elucidate the occurrence and mechanisms of ARGs in earthworms impacted by MPs with different sizes. Nano-size and 10 mg/kg of 100 µm MPs slightly affected the occurrence of ARGs in earthworms. Highest abundance of ARGs was found in the presence of 10 mg/kg of 10 µm MPs, whereas 100 mg/kg of 10 µm MPs significantly changed the profile of ARGs. Metagenomics sequencing and toxicity tests indicated that MPs caused toxicity and influenced the abundance of microbial community in earthworms, resulting in the changes of ARGs. Results of proteomics and metabolomics demonstrated that 100 mg/kg of 10 µm MPs changed the microenvironment of earthworm gut, built a new homeostatic process, and thus increased the abundance of key bacterial that carried a variety of ARGs. This study highlights the size-dependent toxic effects of MPs and their impacts on the transfer of ARGs in terrestrial environments.","Xu G., Yu Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125847,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics Combined With Tetracycline In Soils Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance In The Enchytraeus Crypticus Microbiome,"Growing evidence suggests that microplastics can adsorb antibiotics and may consequently exacerbate effects on the health of exposed organisms. Our current understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil invertebrates is limited. This study aimed to investigate changes in the microbiome and ARGs in Enchytraeus crypticus following exposure to a soil environment that contained both microplastics and antibiotics. Tetracycline (TC), polyamide (PA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were used to construct microcosms of polluted soil environments (TC, PA, PVC, PA+TC, PVC+TC). The differences in microbiomes and ARGs were determined by bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results show that compared with the Control or microplastics alone treatments, TC was significantly accumulated in E. crypticus when exposed to TC alone or in combination with microplastics (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences about TC accumulation between TC, PA+TC, and PVC+TC treated E. crypticus (P > 0.05). Microplastics and TC significantly disturbed the microbial community, and decreased the microbial alpha diversity of E. crypticus (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between TC, microplastics and their combined exposure treatments, and no toxic synergies on the diversity of E. crypticus microbiome between tetracycline and microplastics in soil environment. All the treatments increased the diversity of ARGs in E. crypticus (39–49 ARGs vs. 25 ARGs of control). In particular, treatments combining PVC and TC or PA and TC exposure resulted in greater ARGs abundance than the treatments when E. crypticus was exposed to PVC, PA or TC alone. These results add to our understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on the ARGs and microbiome of soil invertebrates.","Ma J., Sheng G.D., O'Connor P.",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114689,Environmental Pollution
The Dna Phosphorothioation Restriction-Modification System Influences The Antimicrobial Resistance Of Pathogenic Bacteria,"Bacterial defense barriers, such as DNA methylation-associated restriction-modification (R-M) and the CRISPR-Cas system, play an important role in bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recently, a novel R-M system based on DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification has been shown to be widespread in the kingdom of Bacteria as well as Archaea. However, the potential role of the PT R-M system in bacterial AMR remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role of PT R-Ms in AMR with a series of common clinical pathogenic bacteria. By analyzing the distribution of AMR genes related to mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was shown that the presence of PT R-M effectively reduced the distribution of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-derived AMR genes in the genome, even in the bacteria that did not tend to acquire AMR genes by HGT. In addition, unique gene variation analysis based on pangenome analysis and MGE prediction revealed that the presence of PT R-M could suppress HGT frequency. Thus, this is the first report showing that the PT R-M system has the potential to repress HGT-derived AMR gene acquisition by reducing the HGT frequency. IMPORTANCE In this study, we demonstrated the effect of DNA PT modification-based R-M systems on horizontal gene transfer of AMR genes in pathogenic bacteria. We show that there is no apparent association between the genetic background of the strains harboring PT R-Ms and the number of AMR genes or the kinds of gene families. The strains equipped with PT R-M harbor fewer plasmid-derived, prophage-derived, or integrating mobile genetic element (iMGE)-related AMR genes and have a lower HGT frequency, but the degree of inhibition varies among different bacteria. In addition, compared with Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae prefers to acquire MGE-derived AMR genes, and there is no coevolution between PT R-M clusters and bacterial core genes.","Xu C., Rao J., Xie Y., Lu J., Li Z., Dong C., Wang L., Jiang J., Chen C., Chen S.",10.1128/spectrum.03509-22,Microbiology Spectrum
Microplastics Mediates The Spread Of Antimicrobial Resistance Plasmids Via Modulating Conjugal Gene Expression,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and environmental degradation are existential global public health threats. Linking microplastics (MPs) and AMR is particularly concerning as MPs pollution would have significant ramifications on controlling of AMR; however, the effects of MPs on the spread and genetic mechanisms of AMR bacteria remain unclear. Herein, we performed Simonsen end-point conjugation to investigate the impact of four commonly used MPs on transfer of clinically relevant plasmids. The transfer breadth of a representative pA/C_MCR-8 plasmid across bacterial communities was confirmed by the cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our study shows that exposure to four commonly found MPs promotes the conjugation rates of four clinically relevant AMR plasmids by up to 200-fold, when compared to the non-exposed group and that the transfer rates are MP concentrations demonstrate a positive correlation with higher transfer rates. Furthermore, we show that MPs induce the expression of plasmid-borne conjugal genes and SOS-linked genes such as recA, lexA, dinB and dinD. High-throughput sequencing of the broad transmission of plasmid pA/C_MCR-8, shows distribution over two main phyla, Pseudomonadota (50.0 %-95.0 %) and Bacillota (0.4 %-2.0 %). These findings definitively link two global health emergencies − AMR and environmental degradation via MPs, and to tackle global AMR, we must also now consider plastic utilisation and waste management.","Yang Q.E., Lin Z., Gan D., Li M., Liu X., Zhou S., Walsh T.R.",10.1016/j.envint.2025.109261,Environment International
Antimicrobial And Antiviral Nanofibers Halt Co-Infection Spread Via Nuclease-Mimicry And Photocatalysis,"The escalating spread of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses is a grave concern for global health. Nucleic acids dominate the drug-resistance and transmission of pathogenic microbes. Here, imidazolium-type poly(ionic liquid)/porphyrin (PIL-P) based electrospun nanofibrous membrane and its cerium (IV) ion complex (PIL-P-Ce) are developed. The obtained PIL-P-Ce membrane exhibits high and stable efficiency in eradicating various microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and decomposing microbial antibiotic resistance genes and viral nucleic acids under light. The nuclease-mimetic and photocatalytic mechanisms of the PIL-P-Ce are elucidated. Co-infection wound models in mice with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and hepatitis B virus demonstrate that PIL-P-Ce integrate the triple effects of cationic polymer, photocatalysis, and nuclease-mimetic activities. As revealed by proteomic analysis, PIL-P-Ce shows minimal phototoxicity to normal tissues. Hence, PIL-P-Ce has potential as a ""green"" wound dressing to curb the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses in clinical settings.","Yao J., Luo Z., Lin J., Meng N., Guo J., Xu H., Shi R., Zhao L., Zhou J., Yan F., Wang B., Mao H.",10.1002/advs.202309590,"Advanced Science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
"Insight Into Combined Pollution Of Antibiotics And Microplastics In Aquatic And Soil Environment: Environmental Behavior, Interaction Mechanism And Associated Impact Of Resistant Genes","At present, antibiotics and microplastics are two emerging pollutants which widely exist in the water environment. The interaction between antibiotics and microplastics forms combined pollution, which poses potential adverse effects to organisms. Due to its ability to enrich antibiotics, microplastics have received significant attention from the academic circle. This article systematically reviews the interaction of microplastics with antibiotics and the antibiotic resistant genes in microbes. Also, the environmental impacts of the composite pollutants are described. In addition to water media, this article also describes the composite pollution in soil and provides a deeper understanding of the adsorption-desorption of the combined contaminant.

How Antimicrobial Resistance Is Linked To Climate Change: An Overview Of Two Intertwined Global Challenges,"Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change (CC) are two of the top health emergencies, and can be considered as two interlinked public health priorities. The complex commonalities between AMR and CC should be deeply investigated in a One Health perspective. Here, we provided an overview of the current knowledge about the relationship between AMR and CC. Overall, the studies included pointed out the need for applying a systemic approach to planetary health. Firstly, CC increasingly brings humans and animals into contact, leading to outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases with pandemic potential. Although it is well-established that antimicrobial use in human, animal and environmental sectors is one of the main drivers of AMR, the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the current scenario, by influencing the use of antibiotics, personal protective equipment, and biocides. This also results in higher concentrations of contaminants (e.g., microplastics) in natural water bodies, which cannot be completely removed from wastewater treatment plants, and which could sustain the AMR spread. Our overview underlined the lack of studies on the direct relationship between AMR and CC, and encouraged further research to investigate the multiple aspects involved, and its effect on human health.","Magnano San Lio R., Favara G., Maugeri A., Barchitta M., Agodi A.",10.3390/ijerph20031681,International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
Virulence And Antibiotic Resistance Plasticity Of Arcobacter Butzleri: Insights On The Genomic Diversity Of An Emerging Human Pathogen,"Arcobacter butzleri is a foodborne emerging human pathogen, frequently displaying a multidrug resistant character. Still, the lack of comprehensive genome-scale comparative analysis has limited our knowledge on A. butzleri diversification and pathogenicity. Here, we performed a deep genome analysis of A. butzleri focused on decoding its core- and pan-genome diversity and specific genetic traits underlying its pathogenic potential and diverse ecology. A. butzleri (genome size 2.07–2.58 Mbp) revealed a large open pan-genome with 7474 genes (about 50% being singletons) and a small but diverse core-genome with 1165 genes. It presents a plastic virulome (including newly identified determinants), marked by the differential presence of multiple adaptation-related virulence factors, such as the urease cluster ureD(AB)CEFG (phenotypically confirmed), the hypervariable hemagglutinin-encoding hecA, a type I secretion system (T1SS) harboring another agglutinin and a novel VirB/D4 T4SS likely linked to interbacterial competition and cytotoxicity. In addition, A. butzleri harbors a large repertoire of efflux pumps (EPs) and other antibiotic resistant determinants. We unprecedentedly describe a genetic mechanism of A. butzleri macrolides resistance, (inactivation of a TetR repressor likely regulating an EP). Fluoroquinolones resistance correlated with Thr-85-Ile in GyrA and ampicillin resistance was linked to an OXA-15-like β-lactamase. Remarkably, by decoding the polymorphism pattern of the main antigen PorA, we show that A. butzleri is able to exchange porA as a whole and/or hypervariable epitope-encoding regions separately, leading to a multitude of chimeric PorA presentations that can impact pathogen-host interaction during infection. Ultimately, our unprecedented screening of short sequence repeats indicates that phase variation likely modulates A. butzleri key adaptive functions. In summary, this study constitutes a turning point on A. butzleri comparative genomics revealing that this human gastrointestinal pathogen is equipped with vast and diverse virulence and antibiotic resistance arsenals that open a multitude of phenotypic fingerprints for environmental/host adaptation and pathogenicity.","Isidro J., Ferreira S., Pinto M., Domingues F., Oleastro M., Gomes J.P., Borges V.",10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104213,"Infection, Genetics And Evolution"
Can Microplastics Facilitate The Emergence Of Infectious Diseases?,"Plastic pollution is a major environmental problem. Small plastic particles (called microplastics) have been reported to have pernicious effects on human and wildlife health, by altering physiological functions (e.g., immunity, metabolism) and interfering with commensal microorganisms. However, in addition to these direct toxic effects, we suggest that microplastic pollution might also exert deleterious effects, modifying (i) the exposure to pathogens (e.g., multi-drug resistant bacteria) and (ii) the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Therefore, we argue that microplastics should be considered as a ubiquitous environmental hazard, potentially promoting the (re)emergence of infectious diseases. The implementation of multi- and interdisciplinary research projects are crucial to properly evaluate if microplastic pollution should be added to the current list of global health threats.","Loiseau C., Sorci G.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153694,Science Of The Total Environment
Do Combined Nanoscale Polystyrene And Tetracycline Impact On The Incidence Of Resistance Genes And Microbial Community Disturbance In Enchytraeus Crypticus?,"It has been proved that nanoplastics can effectively adsorb pollutants and thus influence their behavior and availability. The combined toxic effects of nanoplastic and its adsorbed pollutant on the soil fauna are still not well known. We used high-throughput quantitative PCR to explore the effects of oral nanoscale polystyrene and tetracycline exposure on antibiotic resistance genes in the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus, and used bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplification sequencing to examine the response of the microbiome of E. crypticus. After 14 days of tetracycline and nanoscale polystyrene exposure, we terminated exposure and monitored the restoration of ARGs and microbiome in the E. crypticus. Results showed that the number of ARGs, especially macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB), tetracycline ARGs, as well as multidrug ARGs, increased with exposure to nanoscale polystyrene and tetracycline. The abundance of Aminoglycoside and Beta_Lactamase ARGs in E. crypticus also significantly increased. The exposure significantly perturbed the abundance of families Microbacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Sphinomonadaceae. After terminating exposure for 14 days, the diversity and abundance of ARGs were not completely restored, while the microbiome was not permanently changed but reversibly impacted.","Ma J., Sheng G.D., Chen Q.-L., O'Connor P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.122012,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Riverine Microplastic And Microbial Community Compositions: A Field Study In The Netherlands,"Plastic pollution in aquatic environments, particularly microplastics (<5 mm), is an emerging health threat. The buoyancy, hydrophobic hard surfaces, novel polymer carbon sources and long-distance transport make microplastics a unique substrate for biofilms, potentially harbouring pathogens and enabling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene exchange. Microplastic concentrations, their polymer types and the associated microbial communities were determined in paired, contemporaneous samples from the Dutch portion of the river Rhine. Microplastics were collected through a cascade of 500/100/10 μm sieves; filtrates and surface water were also analysed. Microplastics were characterized with infrared spectroscopy. Microbial communities and selected virulence and AMR genes were determined with 16S rRNA-sequencing and qPCR. Average microplastic concentration was 213,147 particles/m(3); polyamide and polyvinylchloride were the most abundant polymers. Microbial composition on 100–500 μm samples differed significantly from surface water and 10–100 μm or smaller samples, with lower microbial diversity compared to surface water. An increasingly ‘water-like’ microbial community was observed as particles became smaller. Associations amongst specific microbial taxa, polymer types and particle sizes, as well as seasonal and methodological effects, were also observed. Known biofilm-forming and plastic-degrading taxa (e.g. Pseudomonas) and taxa harbouring potential pathogens (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Arcobacter) were enriched in certain sample types, and other risk-conferring signatures like the sul1 and erm(B) AMR genes were almost ubiquitous. Results were generally compatible with the existence of taxon-selecting mechanisms and reduced microbial diversity in the biofilms of plastic substrates, varying over seasons, polymer types and particle sizes. This study provided updated field data and insights on microplastic pollution in a major riverine environment.","Mughini-Gras L., Van Der Plaats R.Q.J., Van Der Wielen P.W.J.J., Bauerlein P.S., De Roda Husman A.M.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.116852,Water Research
"Microplastics Accelerate Nitrification, Shape The Microbial Community, And Alter Antibiotic Resistance During The Nitrifying Process","Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are both emerging pollutants that are frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the effects of various MPs, including polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA), on nitrification performance, dominant microbial communities, and antibiotic resistance during nitrification were investigated. The results revealed that the addition of MPs increased the specific ammonia oxidation rate and specific nitrate production rate by 15.2 % – 15.5 % and 8.0 % – 11.6 %, respectively, via enrichment of nitrifying microorganisms, Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas. Moreover, ARGs were selectively enriched in nitrifying sludge and microplastic biofilms under stress from different MPs. Compared with PE-MPs (23.9 %) and PVC-MPs (21.4 %), exposure to PLA-MPs significantly increased intI1 abundance by 51.6 %. The results of the variance decomposition analysis implied that MPs and the microbial community play important roles in the behavior of ARGs. Network analysis indicated that Nitrosomonas and potentially pathogenic bacteria emerged as possible hosts, harboring ARGs and intI1 genes in the nitrifying sludge and microplastic biofilms. Critically, PLA-MPs were found to enrich both ARGs and potential pathogenic bacteria during nitrification, which should be considered in their promotion of application processes due to their biodegradability.","Wang Y., Yuan P., Gao P.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.178306,Science Of The Total Environment
Impact Of Aging Of Primary And Secondary Polystyrene Nanoplastics On The Transmission Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Anaerobic Digestion,"Sewage sludge is a significant reservoir of nano/microplastics (NPs/MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Research has revealed that NPs/MPs may exert an inhibitory effect on anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge. Moreover, NPs/MPs can influence microbial community diversity and composition, potentially increasing ARGs dissemination. The morphological changes to NPs/MPs surface due to aging contribute to modifying hydrophobic properties. To date, there is limited comprehension regarding how various surface properties of NPs influence ARGs dissemination during AD. This study investigated the impact of primary aged/non-aged and secondary aged/non-aged polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) propagation during AD. The findings indicated that the UV-aging process resulted in surface oxidation and distinct morphological characteristics in both primary and secondary PSNPs, while the surface oxidation effect was more pronounced in the secondary aged PSNPs. High concentrations (150 μg/L) of primary and secondary PSNPs inhibited methane production, with secondary PSNPs causing greater inhibition by 16 to 20 % compared to control. In contrast, low concentration (25 μg/L) had negligible or slightly positive effects on methane production. PSNPs at 150 μg/L reduced total VFA concentration, indicating an inhibitory effect on the fermentation step in the AD process. Primary and secondary PSNPs exhibited changes in EPS characteristics. ARGs abundance was enriched in reactors amended with PSNPs, with the highest abundance of 8.54 × 10(5) copies/g sludge observed in the secondary aged PSNPs (150 μg/L) reactor. Reactors exposed to aged PSNPs exhibited a relatively higher abundance of ARGs compared to reactors exposed to non-aged PSNPs. Exposure to PSNPs increased the microbial community diversity within the digesters and triggered the enrichment of Comamonadaceae and Syntrophaceae, belonging to Proteobacteria phylum. On the other hand, archaeal communities tended to shift towards hydrogenotrophic methanogens in PSNPs reactors. The correlation analysis showed that Comamonadaceae were positively correlated with the majority of ARGs and intl1. A positive correlation was observed between MGEs and most ARGs, suggesting that the increased proliferation of ARGs under PSNPs exposure may be linked to the abundance of MGEs, which in turn promotes the growth of hosts carrying ARGs. These findings suggest that aged and non-aged NPs could substantially impact the spread of ARGs and MGEs, which also led to notable alterations in the composition of the microbial community. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted impacts of PSNPs with various characteristics on AD processes, microbial communities, and ARGs proliferation, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive assessments of NPs pollutants in the environment.","Haffiez N., Kalantar E., Zakaria B.S., Azizi S.M.M., Farner J.M., Dhar B.R.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174213,Science Of The Total Environment
Mobile Genetic Elements Harboring Antibiotic Resistance Determinants In Acinetobacter Baumannii Isolates From Bolivia,"Using a combination of short- and long-read DNA sequencing, we have investigated the location of antibiotic resistance genes and characterized mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three clinical multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolates, collected in Bolivia, clustered separately with three different international clonal lineages. We found a diverse array of transposons, plasmids and resistance islands related to different insertion sequence (IS) elements, which were located in both the chromosome and in plasmids, which conferred resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including carbapenems. Carbapenem resistance might be caused by a Tn2008 carrying the bla(OXA–23) gene. Some plasmids were shared between the isolates. Larger plasmids were less conserved than smaller ones and they shared some homologous regions, while others were more diverse, suggesting that these big plasmids are more plastic than the smaller ones. The genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance in Bolivia has not been deeply studied until now, and the mobilome of these A. baumannii isolates, combined with their multi-drug resistant phenotype, mirror the transfer and prevalence of MGEs contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide and require special attention. These findings could be useful to understand the antimicrobial resistance genetics of A. baumannii in Bolivia and the difficulty in tackling these infections.","Cerezales M., Xanthopoulou K., Wille J., Krut O., Seifert H., Gallego L., Higgins P.G.",10.3389/fmicb.2020.00919,Frontiers In Microbiology
Co-Exposure Of Microplastics And Sulfamethoxazole Propagated Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Sediments By Regulating The Microbial Carbon Metabolism,"The concerns on the carriers of microplastics (MPs) on co-existing pollutants in aquatic environments are sharply rising in recent years. However, little is known about their interactions on the colonization of microbiota, especially for the spread of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influences on the propagation of ARGs in sediments by the co-exposure of different MPs and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The results showed that the presence of MPs significantly enhanced the contents of total organic carbon, while having no effects on the removal of SMX in sediments. Exposure to SMX and MPs obviously activated the microbial carbon utilization capacities based on the BIOLOG method. The propagation of ARGs in sediments was activated by SMX, which was further promoted by the presence of polylactic acid (PLA) MPs, but significantly lowered by the co-exposed polyethylene (PE) MPs. This apparent difference may be attributed to the distinct influence on the antibiotic efflux pumps of two MPs. Moreover, the propagation of ARGs may be also dominated by microbial carbon metabolism in sediments, especially through regulating the carbon sources of carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This study provides new insights into the carrier effects of MPs in sediments.","Chen Y., Yan Z., Zhang Y., Zhu P., Jiang R., Wang M., Wang Y., Lu G.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132951,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Comparison Of The Efficacy Of Disinfection Using Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide Space Sterilizer For Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria According To Surface Materials,"Introduction: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant bacteria that are spread through contact, and surface disinfection is emphasized in healthcare environmental management. Hydrogen peroxide space disinfection is one of no-touch space disinfection methods. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to confirm disinfection efficacy of AIHP space sterilizer on CPE and VRE strains for each surface material. Methods: This study was conducted at Keimyung University Daegu Dongsan Hospital from August 10 to August 17, 2022. CPE and VRE isolated from the clinical samples were used for this study. Stainless steel, glass, and plastic petri dishes spread with CRE and VRE were placed in several places in the isolation room. The AIHP space sterilizer (MUGYUN, SUNGSAM, Korea) was used for disinfection and this process was repeated three more times (total four times). Results: Disinfection efficacy was assessed through log(10) reduction of the number of cultured strains after disinfection. VRE demonstrated 6.916 log(10) reduction on stainless steel and 7.581 log(10) reduction on plastic. CPE showed 7.393 log(10) reduction on stainless steel and 7.581 log(10) reduction on plastic. Both VRE and CPE were not isolated on glass surfaces. Conclusion: The AIHP space sterilizer exhibited sufficient disinfection efficacy on stainless steels, plastic, and glass with variations in effectiveness depending on surface materials.","Lee J.Y., Lee J.H., Lee K.Y., Kang J.Y., Choi U.Y., Ryu N.H., Hyun M., Kim H.A.",10.1186/s13756-023-01276-2,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Effects And Mechanisms Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Wastewater,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are typical co-existing emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment plants. MPs have been shown to alter the distribution pattern of ARGs in sludge, but their effects on free extracellular ARGs (feARGs) in wastewater remain unclear. In this study, we used fluorescence quantitative PCR to investigate the dynamics of feARGs (including tetC, tetO, sul1, and sul2) in wastewater and their transition mechanisms after 60 d of exposure to typical MPs (polystyrene, PS). The results showed that the absolute abundance of tetracycline feARGs decreased by 28.4 %-76.0 % and 35.2 %-96.2 %, respectively, under nm-level and mm-level PS exposure and changed by -55.4 %-122.4 % under μm-level PS exposure. The abundance of sul1 showed a trend of nm-level &gt; μm-level &gt; mm-level upon PS exposure, and the changes in sul1 abundance was greater with ρ(PS)=50 mg·L-1 exposure. The relative abundance of sul2 was reduced by 25.4 %-42.6 % and 46.1 %-90.3 % after μm-level and mm-level PS exposure, respectively, and increased by 1.9-3.9 times after nm-level PS exposure, and the sul2 showed a higher reduction at ρ (PS)=50 mg·L-1 exposure than that at ρ (PS)=0.5 mg·L-1. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that the relative abundance of feARGs during PS exposure was positively correlated with cell membrane permeability and typical mobile genetic elements (intI1) abundance and negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species level. Our findings elucidated the effects and corresponding mechanisms of PS on the growth and mobility of feARGs in wastewater, providing a scientific basis for the control of the combined MPs and ARGs pollution in wastewater.","Zhou S., Huang A.-C., Huang Z.-F., Li L.-F., Yang F.-J., Chen A.-Q., Xiu F.-C., Gao Y.-Y.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202307246,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Distributions And Types Of Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii In Different Departments Of A General Hospital,"Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most prevalent strain in hospitals and different clinical departments. Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics and resistance mechanisms of A. baumannii isolated from clinical samples in Shaoxing people’s hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University, Shaoxing, China. Patients and Methods: Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from blood, phlegm and skin of the patients hospitalized in different departments as respiratory medicine, plastic surgery and intensive care unit (ICU). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize the isolates. Kirby-Bauer test was used to evaluate antibiotic resistance of the bacteria. The expression of resistance inducing genes was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results were analyzed and compared. Results: Two bacterial types, ST208, and ST218, were identified in all 140 samples. The ST208 mainly came from ICU and department of respiratory medicine, while ST218 from department of plastic surgery; 70.21% of ST208 and 84.78% of ST218 were carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and carbapenem-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB), respectively. Multidrug-resistance genes in CRAB isolated from the hospital mainly included, oxa-23, oxa-5, intl 1 and qaceΔ1-sul 1. Besides, the highest and lowest antibiotic resistance was observed in the strains isolated from blood samples and wounds, respectively. Conclusions: The distribution of AB varies in different clinical departments and samples. In the hospital under study, the main types of AB were ST208 and ST218. The genes which affect the ability of antibiotic-resistance were oxa-23, oxa-51, intl 1 and qaceΔ1-sul 1.","Qian Y., Dong X., Wang Z., Yang G., Liu Q.",10.5812/jjm.22935,Jundishapur Journal Of Microbiology
Distinct Profile Of Bacterial Community And Antibiotic Resistance Genes On Microplastics In Ganjiang River At The Watershed Level,"Microplastics are of great public concern due to their wide distribution and the potential risk to humans and animals. In this study, the microplastic pollution associated with bacterial communities, human pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated compared to water, sediment, and natural wood particles. Microplastics were widely distributed in surface water of the Ganjiang River at a watershed level with an average value of 407 particles m(−3). The fragment was the main microplastic shape found in the basin. Microplastics had significantly higher observed species and Chao1 index of bacterial communities than those in water, but comparable to wood particles. However, there was no difference in the microplastics pollution and alpha diversity indices of bacterial between different reaches along the Ganjiang River. Flavobacterium, Rhodoferax, Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium on the microplastics were all found to be enriched compared with water and sediment. Principal component analysis of the composition and function profile of bacterial communities showed that microplastics provide a new microbial niche in the Ganjiang River, which was distinct from water, sediment, and natural wood. Pseudomonas genus dominated the composition of human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics, which was significantly different from water and sediment. No difference was observed in the relative abundance of total ARGs among the four media. However, microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs compared with water and sediment.","Hu H., Jin D., Yang Y., Zhang J., Ma C., Qiu Z.",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111363,Environmental Research
Plasmid Classification In An Era Of Whole-Genome Sequencing: Application In Studies Of Antibiotic Resistance Epidemiology,"Plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements ubiquitous in bacteria, and commonly transmissible between host cells. Their genomes include variable repertoires of 'accessory genes,' such as antibiotic resistance genes, as well as 'backbone' loci which are largely conserved within plasmid families, and often involved in key plasmid-specific functions (e.g., replication, stable inheritance, mobility). Classifying plasmids into different types according to their phylogenetic relatedness provides insight into the epidemiology of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. Current typing schemes exploit backbone loci associated with replication (replicon typing), or plasmid mobility (MOB typing). Conventional PCR-based methods for plasmid typing remain widely used. With the emergence of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), large datasets can be analyzed using in silico plasmid typing methods. However, short reads from popular high-throughput sequencers can be challenging to assemble, so complete plasmid sequences may not be accurately reconstructed. Therefore, localizing resistance genes to specific plasmids may be difficult, limiting epidemiological insight. Long-read sequencing will become increasingly popular as costs decline, especially when resolving accurate plasmid structures is the primary goal. This review discusses the application of plasmid classification in WGS-based studies of antibiotic resistance epidemiology; novel in silico plasmid analysis tools are highlighted. Due to the diverse and plastic nature of plasmid genomes, current typing schemes do not classify all plasmids, and identifying conserved, phylogenetically concordant genes for subtyping and phylogenetics is challenging. Analyzing plasmids as nodes in a network that represents gene-sharing relationships between plasmids provides a complementary way to assess plasmid diversity, and allows inferences about horizontal gene transfer to be made.","Orlek A., Stoesser N., Anjum M.F., Doumith M., Ellington M.J., Peto T., Crook D., Woodford N., Sarah Walker A., Phan H., Sheppard A.E.",10.3389/fmicb.2017.00182,Frontiers In Microbiology
Entry Pathways Determined The Effects Of Mps On Sludge Anaerobic Digestion System: The Views Of Methane Production And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Fates,"Sludge is one of the primary reservoirs of microplastics (MPs), and the effects of MPs on subsequent sludge treatment raised attention. Given the entry pathways, MPs would exhibit different properties, but the entry pathway-dependent effect of MPs on sludge treatment performance and the fates of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), another high-risk emerging contaminant, were seldom documented. Herein, MPs with two predominant entry pathways, including wastewater-derived (WW-derived) and anaerobic digestion-introduced (AD-introduced), were used to investigate the effects on AD performance and ARGs abundances. The results indicated that WW-derived MPs, namely the MPs accumulated in sludge during the wastewater treatment process, exhibited significant inhibition on methane production by 22.8%–71.6%, while the AD-introduced MPs, being introduced in the sludge AD process, slightly increased the methane yield by 4.7%–17.1%. Meanwhile, MPs were responsible for promoting transmission of target ARGs, and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) showed a greater promotion effect (0.0154–0.0936) than polyamide MPs (PA-MPs) (0.0013–0.0724). Compared to size, entry pathways and types played more vital roles on MPs influences. Investigation on mechanisms based on microbial community structure revealed characteristics (aging degree and types) of MPs determined the differences of AD performance and ARGs fates. WW-derived MPs with longer aging period and higher aging degree would release toxics and decrease the activities of microorganisms, resulting in the negative impact on AD performance. However, AD-introduced MPs with short aging period exhibited marginal impacts on AD performance. Furthermore, the co-occurrent network analysis suggested that the variations of potential host bacteria induced by MPs with different types and aging degree attributed to the dissemination of ARGs. Distinctively from most previous studies, the MPs with different sizes did not show remarkable effects on AD performance and ARGs fates. Our findings benefited the understanding of realistic environmental behavior and effect of MPs with different sources.","Wang X., Huang G., Chen Q., Pang R., Han Z., Zhu J., Xie B., Su Y., Zhou S.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.119061,Environmental Research
The Critical Role Of Microplastics In The Fate And Transformation Of Sulfamethoxazole And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Within Vertical Subsurface-Flow Constructed Wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are reservoirs of microplastics (MPs) in the environment. However, knowledge about the impact of MPs on antibiotic removal and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is limited. We focused on sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a representative compound to examine the effects of MPs on SMX removal and the proliferation and dissemination of two SMX-related ARGs (sul1 and sul2) in vertical subsurface-flow CW (VFCW) microcosm. The presence of MPs in the substrate was found to enhance the proliferation of microorganisms owing to the large specific surface area of the MPs and the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on MP surfaces, which resulted in a high SMX removal ranging from 97.80 % to 99.80 %. However, the presence of MPs promoted microbial interactions and the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, which led to a significant increase in the abundances of sul1 and sul2 of 68.47 % and 17.20 %, respectively. It is thus imperative to implement rigorous monitoring strategies for MPs to mitigate their potential ecological hazards.","Zhang S., Cui L., Zhao Y., Xie H., Song M., Wu H., Hu Z., Liang S., Zhang J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133222,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
The Profile Of Bacterial Infections In A Burn Unit During And After The Covid-19 Pandemic Period,"Infections represent a major complication for burn-injured patients. The aim of this study was to highlight the changes in the incidence and antimicrobial resistance of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients, at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, in relation to the antibiotics used during the pandemic. A comparative analysis of the demographic data and the microorganisms identified in the clinical samples of two groups of burn patients admitted to a university hospital in Romania was carried out. The first group consisted of 48 patients and the second of 69 patients, hospitalized in January–August 2020 and 2023, respectively. The bacterial species with the highest incidence were S. aureus, A. baumannii, Pseudomonas spp. The significant changes between 2023 and 2020 are reflected in the increase in the frequency of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, especially S. maltophilia, and the increase in antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas and Klebsiella spp. Klebsiella spp. did not change in frequency (7%), but there was a significant increase in the incidence of K. pneumoniae strains with pan-drug resistant behaviour to antibiotics (40%), including colistin. The phenomenon can be explained by the selection of specimens carrying multiple resistance genes, as a result of antibiotic treatment during the COVID-19 period. The post-pandemic antimicrobial resistance detected in burn patients indicates the need for permanent surveillance of the resistance trends, primarily due to the limited therapeutic options available for these patients.","Musuroi C., Musuroi S.-I., Baditoiu L., Crainiceanu Z., Muntean D., Voinescu A., Izmendi O., Sirmon A., Licker M.",10.3390/antibiotics13090823,Antibiotics
High Concentration Of Ammonia Sensitizes The Response Of Microbial Electrolysis Cells To Tetracycline,"Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a promising technology for effective energy conversion of wastewater organics to biogas. Yet, in swine wastewater treatment, the complex contaminants including antibiotics may affect MEC performance, while the high ammonia concentration might increase this risk by increasing cell membrane permeability. In this work, the responses of MECs on tetracycline (TC) with low and high ammonia loadings (80 and 1000 mg L(–1)) were fully investigated. The TC of 0 to 1 mg L(–1) slightly improved MEC performance in current production and electrochemical characteristics with low ammonia loading, while TC ≥ 4 mg L(–1) started to show negative effects. Generally, the high ammonia loading sensitized MECs to TC concentration, inducing the current and COD removal of MECs to sharply decline with TC ≥ 0.5 mg L(–1). The positive effect of high ammonia loading on MEC due to conductivity increase was counteracted with TC ≥ 1 mg L(–1). The co-contamination of TC and ammonia significantly decreased the bioactivity and biomass of anode biofilm. Although the high concentration of co-existing TC and ammonia inhibited MEC performance, the reactors still obtained positive energy feedback. The network analyses indicated that the effluent suspension contributed much to antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transmission, while the microplastics (MPs) in wastewater greatly raised the risks of ARGs spreading. This work systematically examined the synergetic effects of TC and ammonia and the transmission of ARGs in MEC operation, which is conducive to expediting the application of MECs in swine wastewater treatment.","Wang N., Xue L., Ding G., Han Y., Feng Y., Liu J., Li N., He W.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119064,Water Research
"Antibiotic Use By Dentists In Germany: A Review Of Prescriptions, Pathogens, Antimicrobial Resistance And Antibiotic Stewardship Strategies","BACKGROUND: In Germany, 85% of all antibiotics are prescribed in the outpatient care sector, and dentists account for 11% of the total outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Summarise published literature on antibiotic use, pathogens and antibiotic resistance in odontogenic infections and German clinical guidelines and interventions for antibiotic use in dental care. RESULTS: In contrast to other outpatient physicians, the volume of antibiotics prescribed by dentists in Germany did not decrease over the last decade. Penicillins and aminopenicillins are the most frequently prescribed antibiotics (70% of all prescriptions), followed by clindamycin (26%). Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. are frequent pathogens isolated from odontogenic infections. However, the infections are often polybacterial with a mixed growth of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. While the widespread use of penicillin class antibiotics is compatible with German recommendations on empiric antibiotic therapy, there is evidence that pathogens from odontogenic infections frequently exhibit resistance against them. Moreover, the high prescription volume of clindamycin (⟩25%) appears to be inadequate, since relatively high resistance rates are observed and clindamycin is not recommended as first-line choice in empiric antibiotic therapy. National and international studies show that continuous education of patients and dentists, individual prescription feedback as well as evidence-based guidelines are important measures to improve antibiotic prescription patterns among dentists. CONCLUSION: To promote rational antibiotic use in outpatient dental care, antibiotic stewardship measures are necessary that include prescription guidelines based on AMR surveillance data as well as continuous education of dentists.","Tolksdorf K., Freytag A., Bleidorn J., Markwart R.",10.1922/CDH_00172Konrad07,Community Dental Health
Interactions Of Human Drug Transporters With Chemical Additives Present In Plastics: Potential Consequences For Toxicokinetics And Health,"Human membrane drug transporters are recognized as major actors of pharmacokinetics; they also handle endogenous compounds, including hormones and metabolites. Chemical additives present in plastics interact with human drug transporters, which may have consequences for the toxicokinetics and toxicity of these widely-distributed environmental and/or dietary pollutants, to which humans are highly exposed. The present review summarizes key findings about this topic. In vitro assays have demonstrated that various plastic additives, including bisphenols, phthalates, brominated flame retardants, poly-alkyl phenols and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, can inhibit the activities of solute carrier uptake transporters and/or ATP-binding cassette efflux pumps. Some are substrates for transporters or can regulate their expression. The relatively low human concentration of plastic additives from environmental or dietary exposure is a key parameter to consider to appreciate the in vivo relevance of plasticizer-transporter interactions and their consequences for human toxicokinetics and toxicity of plastic additives, although even low concentrations of pollutants (in the nM range) may have clinical effects. Existing data about interactions of plastic additives with drug transporters remain somewhat sparse and incomplete. A more systematic characterization of plasticizer-transporter relationships is needed. The potential effects of chemical additive mixtures towards transporter activities and the identification of transporter substrates among plasticizers, as well as their interactions with transporters of emerging relevance deserve particular attention. A better understanding of the human toxicokinetics of plastic additives may help to fully integrate the possible contribution of transporters to the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of plastics-related chemicals, as well as to their deleterious effects towards human health.","Tastet V., Le Vée M., Bruyère A., Fardel O.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121882,Environmental Pollution
"Occurrence And Fate Of Cecs (Omps, Args And Pathogens) During Decentralised Treatment Of Black Water And Grey Water","Decentralised wastewater treatment is becoming a suitable strategy to reduce cost and environmental impact. In this research, the performance of two technologies treating black water (BW) and grey water (GW) fractions of urban sewage is carried out in a decentralised treatment of the wastewater produced in three office buildings. An Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) treating BW and a Hybrid preanoxic Membrane Bioreactor (H-MBR) containing small plastic carrier elements, treating GW were operated at pilot scale. Their potential on reducing the release of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as Organic Micropollutants (OMPs), Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) and pathogens was studied. After 226 d of operation, a stable operation was achieved in both systems: the AnMBR removed 92.4 ± 2.5 % of influent COD, and H-MBR removed 89.7 ± 3.5 %. Regarding OMPs, the profile of compounds differed between BW and GW, being BW the matrix with more compounds detected at higher concentrations (up to μg L(−1)). For example, in the case of ibuprofen the concentrations in BW were 23.63 ± 3.97 μg L(−1), 3 orders of magnitude higher than those detected in GW. The most abundant ARGs were sulfonamide resistant genes (sul1) and integron class 1 (intl1) in both BW and GW. Pathogenic bacteria counts were reduced between 1 and 3 log units in the AnMBR. Bacterial loads in GW were much lower than in BW, being no bacterial re-growth observed for the GW effluents after treatment in the H-MBR. None of the selected enteric viruses was detected in GW treatment line.","Rivadulla M., Lois M., Elena A.X., Balboa S., Suarez S., Berendonk T.U., Romalde J.L., Garrido J.M., Omil F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169863,Science Of The Total Environment
"Effect Of Microplastics On Oxytetracycline Trophic Transfer: Immune, Gut Microbiota And Antibiotic Resistance Gene Responses","Microplastics and antibiotics are prevalent and emerging pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, but their interactions in aquatic food chains remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of polypropylene microplastics (PP-MPs) on oxytetracycline (OTC) trophic transfer from the shrimp (Neocaridina denticulate) to crucian carp (Carassius auratus) by metagenomic sequencing. The carrier effects of PP-MPs promoted OTC bioaccumulation and trophic transfer, which exacerbated enterocyte vacuolation and hepatocyte eosinophilic necrosis. PP-MPs enhanced the inhibitory effect of OTC on intestinal lysozyme activities and complement C3 levels in shrimp and fish, and hepatic immunoglobulin M levels in fish (p < 0.05). Co-exposure of MPs and OTC markedly increased the abundance of Actinobacteria in shrimp and Firmicutes in fish, which caused disturbances in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Moreover, OTC exacerbated the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic animals, and PP-MPs significantly increased the diversity and abundance of ARGs and facilitated the trophic transfer of teta and tetm. Our findings disclosed the impacts of PP-MPs on the mechanism of antibiotic toxicity in aquatic food chains and emphasized the importance of gut microbiota for ARGs trophic transfer, which contributed to a deeper understanding of potential risks posed by complex pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.","Zhang P., Lu G., Sun Y., Yan Z., Zhang L., Liu J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134147,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Co-Occurrence Of Microplastics, Pfass, Antibiotics, And Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Groundwater And Their Composite Impacts On Indigenous Microbial Communities: A Field Study","There is a major gap in the occurrence of mixed emerging contaminants, which hinders our efforts in exploring their behaviors and transport in environmental media, as well as their toxicity to human and ecosystem. This study assessed the occurrence and their correlations of mixed contamination by microplastics (MPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in groundwater collected from a pharmaceutical and chemical industrial park. MPs, PFASs, antibiotics and ARGs were detected at all monitoring wells. The total concentration range of MPs and 20 PFASs were 693–1032 pieces/L and 577.47–2982.45 ng/L, respectively, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the most prevalent compound among PFASs in groundwater. The abundance of detected target antibiotics and ARGs ranged from 1.97 to 30.65 ng/L and from 2.65 × 10(2) to 7.53 × 10(5) copies/mL, respectively. MPs and PFASs have a significant positive correlation, yet interestingly, no correlation was found between antibiotics and ARGs. In addition, the relatively high abundance of integron intI1 detected in the study area illustrated the potential horizontal transfer risk of ARGs in the subsurface. Furthermore, the effects of these mixed emerging contaminants on the indigenous microbial communities were elucidated. The coexistence of MPs, PFASs, antibiotics, and ARGs led to the enrichment of species that were tolerant to pollutants. Specifically, MPs, PFASs and ARGs were found to be positively correlated with Acinetobacter, unclassified_f__Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonas, Simplicispira and Proteiniphilum, while antibiotics were positively associated with Paenisporosarcina and Arthrobacter. Moreover, geochemical parameters such as oxidation-reduction potential and nitrate also played a key role in shaping the microbial community structure. The co-occurrence of mixed emerging contaminants highlighted in this study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive environmental monitoring, systematic toxicity assessments, and stricter regulatory frameworks. In addition, it offers insights in the development of effective bioremediation strategies to mitigate their impacts on both ecosystems and public health.","Yashir N., Sun Q., Zhang X., Ma M., Wang D., Feng Y., Song X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.178373,Science Of The Total Environment
Metagenomic Insights Into Environmental Risk Of Field Microplastics In An Urban River,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as anthropogenic vectors for the colonization and transportation of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of the microbiome and its environmental risk on field MPs at watershed scale has rarely been explored. Here, geographical distributions of microbiome, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) on field MPs at watershed scale were characterized and their potential environmental risks were evaluated based on the data from metagenomic analyzes. The succession of microbial communities on MPs was observed along the watershed, and some ARGs and VFs were significantly enriched on MPs in urban region in comparison with rural region. Potential environmental risk of MPs conducted by Projection Pursuit Regression model in midstream (peri-urban region) and downstream (urban region) were significantly higher than that in upstream (rural region), and exhibit close relationships with MPs concentration and water velocity. Furthermore, our source tracking results demonstrated that the microbiome, ARGs and VFs in urban region MPs were largely derived from rural region MPs. Our results caution us that special attention should be paid to the risks posed by MPs in urban water bodies, and highlight the threat of MPs from rural upstream areas.","Li R., Zhu L., Wang Y., Zhu Y.-G.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119018,Water Research
"Microplastic Biofilm, Associated Pathogen And Antimicrobial Resistance Dynamics Through A Wastewater Treatment Process Incorporating A Constructed Wetland","Microplastics in wastewater are colonized by biofilms containing pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that can be exported into receiving water bodies. This study investigated establishment and changes in microplastic-associated biofilm and AMR during a conventional full-scale 2100 population equivalent wastewater treatment process combined with a free water surface polishing constructed wetland. Sequential microplastic colonization experiments were conducted at different stages of the wastewater treatment process, including in raw sewage, treated effluent and the constructed wetland. Two scenarios were tested in which the constructed wetland served as either (i) a polishing step or (ii) as primary recipient of sewage inoculated microplastics. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was carried out for qualitative bacterial community analysis. qPCR was applied for quantitative analysis of AMR genes (sul1, ermB, tetW, intiI1), bacterial biomass (16S rRNA) and a human fecal marker (HF183). Microbial diversity on microplastics increased with incubation time. The initial sewage-derived biofilm composition changed more significantly in the wastewater effluent compared to the constructed wetland. Pathogen and AMR load decreased by up to two orders of magnitude after coupled conventional and constructed wetland treatment, while less impact was observed when sewage-inoculated microplastic material was directly transferred into the constructed wetland. Aeromonas, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with AMR in microplastic-associated biofilms. Despite decreasing trends on human pathogens and AMR load along the treatment process, microplastic-associated biofilms were a considerable potential hotspot for AMR (intI1 gene) and accommodated Cyanobacteria and fish pathogens.","Bydalek F., Webster G., Barden R., Weightman A.J., Kasprzyk-Hordern B., Wenk J.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.119936,Water Research
Polyethylene Terephthalate Microplastic Fibers Increase The Release Of Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes During Sewage Sludge Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastic fibers (MFs), as the most frequently detected microplastic shape in sewage sludge, have posed emerging concern for sludge treatment and disposal. However, the effect of MFs on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs) during sludge treatment remains far from explicit. Therefore, this study investigated the potential impact of MFs on eARGs during sludge anaerobic digestion (AD), a commonly used sludge treatment method, through long-term operation. The qPCR results showed that both absolute and relative abundances of eARGs increased with the MFs exposure during sludge AD. The average absolute and relative abundances of eight tested eARGs in the AD reactor with the highest MFs dosage (170 items/gTS) were 1.70 and 2.15 times higher than those in the control AD reactor. The metagenomics results further comfirmed the increase of eARGs abundance during sludge anaerobic digestion after MFs exposure and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity. The identification of the potential hosts of eARGs suggested the host numbers of eARGs also increased with MFs exposure, which may suggest enhanced horizonal transformation as a result of increased eARGs. Further exploring the mechansims showed that the genes involved in type IV secretion system was upregulated after MFs exposure, suggesting the active release of eARGs was enhanced with MFs exposure. In contrast, the MFs may not affect the passive release of eARGs as its impact on cell membrance damage was insignificant.

PET exposure altered the structure and function of soil microbial, enabling specific microbial groups to thrive in polluted environments. High-dose PET treatments markedly increased the abundance and dissemination of ARGs, primarily via resistance mechanisms such as antibiotic efflux and target alteration. By providing additional carbon sources and surfaces for microbial attachment, PET stimulated the growth of microorganisms harboring MDGs, resulting in an increase in MDGs abundance. The elevated expression of MDGs facilitated the propagation of ARGs, with overlapping host microorganisms suggesting that certain microbial groups exhibit dual metabolic capabilities, enabling them to endure both antibiotic and microplastic pressures. Toxic byproducts of microplastic degradation, such as mono-ethylhexyl phthalate, further promoted ARGs dissemination by increasing horizontal gene transfer frequency. Structural equation modeling revealed that PET indirectly influenced ARGs and MDGs expression by altering soil C/N ratio, available phosphorus, and enzyme activities. Thus, nanoscale PET exacerbates ecological risks to soil microbial communities by driving co-propagation of ARGs and MDGs, highlighting the persistent threat of composite pollution to agroecosystems.","Li Y., Qin W., Xin X., Tang C., Huang Y., He X., Chen L., Yu G., Yu F.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.137173,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Multiomics Analysis Of The Effects Of Manure-Borne Doxycycline Combined With Oversized Fiber Microplastics On Pak Choi Growth And The Risk Of Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transmission,"In this study, oversized microplastics (OMPs) were intentionally introduced into soil containing manure-borne doxycycline (DOX). This strategic approach was used to systematically examine the effects of combined OMP and DOX pollution on the growth of pak choi, analyze alterations in soil environmental metabolites, and explore the potential migration of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results revealed a more pronounced impact of DOX than of OMPs. Slender-fiber OMPs (SF OMPs) had a more substantial influence on the growth of pak choi than did coarse-fiber OMPs (CF OMPs). Conversely, CF OMPs had a more significant effect on the migration of ARGs within the system. When DOX was combined with OMPs, the negative effects of DOX on pak choi growth were mitigated through the synthesis of indole through the adjustment of carbon metabolism and amino acid metabolism in pak choi roots. In this process, Pseudohongiellaceae and Xanthomonadaceae were key bacteria. During the migration of ARGs, the potential host bacterium Limnobacter should be considered. Additionally, the majority of potential host bacteria in the pak choi endophytic environment were associated with tetG. This study provides insights into the intricate interplay among DOX, OMPs, ARGs, plant growth, soil metabolism, and the microbiome.","Chen J.-Y., Niu S.-H., Li H.-Y., Liao X.-D., Xing S.-C.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134931,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microplastics And Chemical Leachates From Plastic Pipes Are Associated With Increased Virulence And Antimicrobial Resistance Potential Of Drinking Water Microbial Communities,"There is increasing recognition of the potential impacts of microplastics (MPs) on human health. As drinking water is the most direct route of human exposure to MPs, there is an urgent need to elucidate MPs source and fate in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Here, we showed polypropylene random plastic pipes exposed to different water quality (chlorination and heating) and environmental (freeze-thaw) conditions accelerated MPs generation and chemical leaching. MPs showed various morphology and aggregation states, and chemical leaches exhibited distinct profiles due to different physicochemical treatments. Based on the physiological toxicity of leachates, oxidative stress level was negatively correlated with disinfection by-products in the leachates. Microbial network analysis demonstrated exposure to leachates (under three treatments) undermined microbial community stability and increased the relative abundance and dominance of pathogenic bacteria. Leachate physical and chemical properties (i.e., MPs abundance, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, total organic carbon, dissolved ECs) exerted significant (p < 0.05) effects on the functional genes related to virulence, antibiotic resistance and metabolic pathways. Notably, chlorination significantly increased correlations among pathogenic bacteria, virulence genes, and antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, this study advances the understanding of direct and indirect risks of these MPs released from plastic pipes in the DWDS.","Yang X., Zhou Y., Xia R., Liao J., Liu J., Yu P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132900,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Different Infection Profiles And Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns Between Burn Icu And Common Wards,"Infection is the leading cause of complications and deaths after burns. However, the difference in infection patterns between the burn intensive care unit (BICU) and burn common wards (BCW) have not been clearly investigated. The present study aimed to compare the infection profile, antimicrobial resistance, and their changing patterns in burn patients in BICU and BCW. Clinical samples were analyzed between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019, in the Institute of Burn Research in Southwest China. The patient information, pathogen distribution, sources, and antimicrobial resistance were retrospectively collected. A total of 3457 and 4219 strains were detected in BICU and BCW, respectively. Wound secretions accounted for 86.6% and 44.9% in BCW and BICU, respectively. Compared with samples in BCW, samples in BICU had more fungi (11.8% vs. 8.1%), more Gram-negative bacteria (60.0% vs. 50.8%), and less Gram-positive bacteria (28.2% vs. 41.1%). Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common pathogen in BICU, compared with Staphylococcus aureus in BCW. S. aureus was the most frequent pathogen in wound secretions and tissues from both BICU and BCW. However, A. baumannii were the first in blood, sputum, and catheter samples from BICU. Overall, the multidrug-resistance (MDR) rate was higher in BICU than in BCW. However, the gap between BICU and BCW gradually shortened from 2011 to 2019. The prevalence of MDR A. baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia significantly increased, especially in BCW. Furthermore, Carbapenem resistance among K. pneumoniae significantly increased in BICU (4.5% in 2011 vs. 40% in 2019) and BCW (0 in 2011 vs. 40% in 2019). However, the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa sharply dropped from 85.7% to 24.5% in BICU. The incidence of MRSA was significantly higher in BICU than in BCW (94.2% vs. 71.0%) and stayed at a high level in BICU (89.5% to 96.3%). C. tropicalis and C. albicans were the two most frequent fungi. No resistance to Amphotericin B was detected. Our study shows that the infection profile is different between BICU and BCW, and multidrug resistance is more serious in BICU than BCW. Therefore, different infection-control strategies should be emphasized in different burn populations.","Gong Y., Peng Y., Luo X., Zhang C., Shi Y., Zhang Y., Deng J., Peng Y., Luo G., Li H.",10.3389/fcimb.2021.681731,Frontiers In Cellular And Infection Microbiology
The Characteristics Of The Novel Bacterial Strain Pseudomonas Mendocina Isolated From Freshwater Aquaculture Farm,"Plastic contamination can cause damage to the water quality of fish farm ponds, and also affect the quality of the final product. Pseudomonas mendocina was found to biodegrade plastics. Our study aimed to investigate the physicochemical properties and drug resistance of P. mendocina isolated from local freshwater aquaculture farms. Firstly, the strain was isolated from aquaculture water and then identified by matrix-assisted flight mass spectrometry and 16S rDNA sequencing. Then, biochemical and antibiotic resistance analyses were performed, and a microbial high-throughput growth detector was used to assess the growth of the strain. Finally, PCR and proteomics analyses were conducted to determine drug-resistance-related genes/proteins. According to the results of the spectrum diagram and sequencing, the isolated bacteria were identified as P. mendocina, and were positive for reactions of ADH, MTE, LAC, MNE, FRU, CIT, MLT, ONPG, and ACE. P. mendocina was sensitive to most of the antibiotics, and its resistance to CHL, MIN, and TIC/CLA was intermediate. Additionally, gyrB was the resistance gene, and mdtA2, mdtA3, mdaB, and emrK1 were closely related to the drug resistance of P. mendocina. Our results show the biochemical properties of P. mendocina in isolated aquaculture water, and provide a new perspective for P. mendocina involved in the biological removal of plastics or microplastics in freshwater aquaculture farms.","Yan K., Wei S., Wang H.",10.14715/cmb/2024.70.5.4,Cellular And Molecular Biology
Biofilm Enhances The Interactive Effects Of Microplastics And Oxytetracycline On Zebrafish Intestine,"The enhanced adsorption of pollutants on biofilm-developed microplastics has been proved in many studies, but the ecotoxicological effects of biofilm-developed microplastics on organisms are still unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to original microplastics, biofilm-developed microplastics, original microplastics absorbed with oxytetracycline (OTC), and biofilm-developed microplastics absorbed with OTC for 30 days. The intestinal histological damage, intestinal biomarker response, gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profile of zebrafish were measured to explore the roles of biofilm in the effects of microplastics. The results showed that biofilm-developed microplastics significantly increased the number of goblet cells in intestinal epithelium compared with the control group. The biofilm-developed microplastics also induced the oxidative response in the zebrafish intestines, and biofilm changed the response mode in the combined treatment with OTC. Additionally, the biofilm-developed microplastics caused intestinal microbiome dysbiosis, and induced the abundance of some pathogenic genera increasing by several times compared with the control group and the original microplastics treatments, regardless of OTC adsorption. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in biofilm-developed microplastics increased significantly compared with the control and the original microplastic treatments. This study emphasized the significant influence and unique role of biofilm in microplastic studies.","Yu Z., Qiu D., Zhou T., Zeng L., Yan C.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106905,Aquatic Toxicology
Integrative Conjugative Elements Mediate The High Prevalence Of Tmexcd3-Toprj1B In Proteus Spp. Of Animal Source,"Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are important mobile elements that are associated with the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in Proteus. Recent studies demonstrated that the tigecycline resistance gene cluster tmexCD-toprJ has emerged in ICEs of Proteus. However, the prevalence of tmexCD-toprJ positive Proteus from animal sources is unclear. To cover the gap, a total of 762 Proteus spp. were isolated from animal source from six provinces of China to identify the tmexCD-toprJ positive isolates. Eight tmexCD-toprJ positive isolates were identified,with the tmexCD-toprJ positive rate of 1.05% against all Proteus spp. and 2.79% against ICE-bearing Proteus spp. The tmexCD-toprJ gene cluster in these Proteus spp. were tmexCD3-toprJ1b and all of them were carried by ICEs. Genetic structure analysis showed that tmexCD3-toprJ1b-bearing ICEs were complicated and plastic, but the tmexCD3-toprJ1b was specificallyintegrated into variable region III (VRIII) of ICEs with the help of integrases. Furthermore, we found that the umuC gene, which is presented in VRIII of ICEs and other genetic structures of many other bacterial genomes, was a hotspot for the integration of tmexCD-toprJ-bearing potential mobile elements. In summary, our results suggested that Proteus were important reservoirs for tmexCD-toprJ due to the high prevalence of ICEs. Therefore, continuous surveillance of ICEs-associated ARGs in Proteus is necessary and significantfor controlling their future transmission.","Peng K., Li Y., Wang Q., Yang P., Wang Z., Li R.",10.1128/msystems.00429-23,Msystems
Effects Of Aging Of Polyethylene Microplastics And Polystyrene Nanoplastics On Antibiotic Resistance Gene Transfer During Primary Sludge Fermentation,"The increasing presence of nano and microplastics (NPs/MPs) in wastewater treatment plants and their inevitable accumulation in the sludge has raised serious concerns in recent years. This study investigated the effects of pristine and aged polyethylene microplastics (PEMPs), polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs), and their mixtures on the primary sludge fermentation process. Pristine MPs/NPs (150 μg/L and 2 g/L for PsNPs and PEMPs, respectively) underwent two weeks of weathering in the presence of humic and alginic acids. The results from a batch fermentation experiment (15 days, pH 10) revealed that the exposure to aged PEMPs/PsNPs experienced greater VFA production than pristine samples. Notably, the aged PEMPs/PsNPs mixture showed a 23.12% increase in VFA production over the pristine mixture. The relative abundance and total concentration of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) increased in all PEMPs/PsNPs batches compared to the control, with the most significant rise in total ARGs observed in the aged PEMPs sample. Aged PEMPs exhibited a 26.22-fold increase in tetA genes, while aged mix samples showed a 19.68-fold increase in tetM genes compared to their pristine counterparts. Both pristine and aged PEMPs/PsNPs, particularly the aged PEMPs adversely affected the microbial communities at the genus level and altered the microbial structure. Microbial richness and diversity were enhanced in samples exposed to pristine PEMPs/PsNPs and aged PsNPs but decreased in aged PEMPs and in the aged mixture group, suggesting a negative impact of aged polyethylene microplastics on microbial communities. Correlation analysis suggested that phyla Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and TM7 are potential hosts of ARGs. These findings manifest the substantial effects of aged nano/microplastics compared to their pristine forms, emphasizing the complex interplay between various forms of PEMPs/PsNPs and microbial dynamics in sludge fermentation processes.","Saila R., Dhar B.R.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177589,Science Of The Total Environment
Photochemistry Of Microplastics-Derived Dissolved Organic Matter: Reactive Species Generation And Organic Pollutant Degradation,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from microplastics (MPs-DOM) is increasingly recognized as a substantial component of aquatic DOM. The photochemistry of MPs-DOM, essential for understanding its environmental fate and impacts, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the photochemical behaviors of MPs-DOM derived from two common plastics: polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which represent aromatic and aliphatic plastics, respectively. Spectral and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that photoreactions preferentially targeted poly-aromatic compounds within the MPs-DOM, leading to degradation products that predominantly form N-aliphatic/lipid-like substances. This transformation is characterized by decreased aromaticity and unsaturation. Additionally, irradiation of MPs-DOM generated reactive species (RS), including triplet intermediates ((3)DOM*) and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)), with apparent quantum yields of 0.06–0.16 % and 0.16–0.35 %, respectively—values considerably lower than those for conventional DOM (1.19–1.56 % for (3)DOM* and 1.34–1.90 % for (1)O(2)). Despite this, the RS generated from MPs-DOM significantly enhance the degradation of coexisting organic pollutants, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The findings shed light on the photoinduced transformation of MPs-DOM and suggest that MPs-DOM functions as a natural photocatalyst, mediating redox reactions of pollutants in sunlit aquatic settings. This highlights its previously underestimated role in natural attenuation and aquatic photochemistry.","Zhang J., Hou X., Zhang K., Xiao Q., Gardea-Torresdey J.L., Zhou X., Yan B.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.122802,Water Research
"Prevalence Of Pharmaceuticals And Personal Care Products, Microplastics And Co-Infecting Microbes In The Post-Covid-19 Era And Its Implications On Antimicrobial Resistance And Potential Endocrine Disruptive Effects","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic's steady condition coupled with predominance of emerging contaminants in the environment and its synergistic implications in recent times has stoked interest in combating medical emergencies in this dynamic environment. In this context, high concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), microplastics (MPs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and soaring coinfecting microbes, tied with potential endocrine disruptive (ED) are critical environmental concerns that requires a detailed documentation and analysis. During the pandemic, the identification, enumeration, and assessment of potential hazards of PPCPs and MPs and (used as anti-COVID-19 agents/applications) in aquatic habitats have been attempted globally. Albeit receding threats in the magnitude of COVID-19 infections, both these pollutants have still posed serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the very health and hygiene of the population in the vicinity. The surge in the contaminants post-COVID also renders them to be potent vectors to harbor and amplify AMR. Pertinently, the present work attempts to critically review such instances to understand the underlying mechanism, interactions swaying the current health of our environment during this post-COVID-19 era. During this juncture, although prevention of diseases, patient care, and self-hygiene have taken precedence, nevertheless antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts have been overlooked. Unnecessary usage of PPCPs and plastics during the pandemic has resulted in increased emerging contaminants (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients and MPs) in various environmental matrices. It was also noticed that among COVID-19 patients, while the bacterial co-infection prevalence was 0.2–51%, the fungi, viral, protozoan and helminth were 0.3–49, 1–22, 2–15, 0.4–15% respectively, rendering them resistant to residual PPCPs. There are inevitable chances of ED effects from PPCPs and MPs applied previously, that could pose far-reaching health concerns. Furthermore, clinical and other experimental evidence for many newer compounds is very scarce and demands further research. Pro-active measures targeting effective waste management, evolved environmental policies aiding strict regulatory measures, and scientific research would be crucial in minimizing the impact and creating better preparedness towards such events among the masses fostering sustainability.","Kumar M., Mazumder P., Silori R., Manna S., Panday D.P., Das N., Sethy S.K., Kuroda K., Mahapatra D.M., Mahlknecht J., Tyagi V.K., Singh R., Zang J., Barceló D.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166419,Science Of The Total Environment
Co-Existence Of Polyethylene Microplastics And Tetracycline On Soil Microbial Community And Args,"Microplastics are plastic particles with particle size less than 5 mm in the environment. As an emerging organic pollutant, the presence of microplastics in the soil environment has been widely noticed. Also, due to the overuse of antibiotics, a large amount of antibiotics that cannot be fully absorbed by humans and livestock enter the soil environment in the form of urine or manure, making the soils suffer from serious antibiotic contamination problems. To address the environmental problems of microplastics and antibiotic contamination in soils, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of PE microplastics on antibiotic degradation, microbial community characteristics and ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. The results showed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the degradation of tetracycline, and significantly increased the organic carbon content and decreased the neutral phosphatase activity. The addition of PE microplastics significantly reduced the alpha diversity of soil microbial community. Compared to the single tetracycline contamination. In addition, combined contamination with PE microplastics and tetracycline significantly affected bacterial genera such as Aeromicrobium, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium and Intrasporangium. Metagenome sequencing studies revealed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the dissipation of ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. There were strong positive correlations between Multidrug, Aminoglycoside and Clycopeptide resistance genes and Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria in tetracycline contaminated soils, and there was a strong positive correlation between Aminoglycoside resistance genes and Actinobacteria in combined contamination of PE microplastics and tetracycline. This study will provide some data support for the current environmental risk assessment of the coexistence of multiple contaminants in soil.","Ya H., Zhang T., Xing Y., Lv M., Wang X., Jiang B.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139082,Chemosphere
"Effects Of Polypropylene Microplastics On Digestion Performance, Microbial Community, And Antibiotic Resistance During Microbial Anaerobic Digestion","As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs) have attracted increasing attention worldwide. The effects of polypropylene (PP) MPs on digestion performance, behaviors of dominant microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements in microbial anaerobic digesters were investigated. The results showed that the addition of PP-MPs to digesters led to an increase in methane production of 10.8% when 300 particles/g TSS of PP-MPs was introduced compared with that in digester not treated with PP-MPs. This increase was attributed to the enrichment of acetogens such as Syntrophobacter (42.0%), Syntrophorhabdus (27.0%), and Syntrophomonas (10.6%), and methanogens including Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta. tetX was highly enriched due to PP-MP exposure, whereas parC exhibited the greatest increase (35.5% – 222.7%). Horizontal gene transfer via ISCR1 and intI1 genes might play an important role in the spread of ARGs. Overall, these findings provide comprehensive insight into the ecological dynamics of PP-MPs during microbial anaerobic digestion.","Xiao Y., Qin Y., Jiang X., Gao P.",10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131358,Bioresource Technology
Antimicrobial Activity Of Amphiphilic Triazole-Linked Polymers Derived From Renewable Sources,"Conventional engineered polymers are strong, stable, and can interact desirably within the human body in implants and medical devices. However, bacterial colonization of medical devices and implants constructed from these materials results in numerous hospital acquired infections (HAI) and deaths each year. Polytriazole based plastics containing triazole rings and fatty acid derivatives have been synthesized from biological sources without catalysts or solvents. In this study, three amphiphilic polytriazoles with varying triazole density and hydrophilic/hydrophobic segments demonstrated broad spectrum, contact antimicrobial properties against both Gram positive and negative bacteria. SEM analysis of bacteria killed by these polymers evidence membrane damage, indicating that these polymers act by direct contact with bacterial membranes. Surface hydrophobicity of these polymers increased with increasing triazole group density, which also improved the antimicrobial efficacy. This work demonstrates that amphiphilic polytriazoles have antimicrobial properties and that future utilization of triazole modified polymers may produce self-sterilizing materials which resist bacterial contamination and formation of antibiotic resistant organisms, ideal characteristics for medically relevant biomaterials.","Floros M.C., Bortolatto J.F., Oliveira O.B., Salvador S.L., Narine S.S.",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5b00412,Acs Biomaterials Science And Engineering
Water And Health: From Environmental Pressures To Integrated Responses,"The water-related exposome is a significant determinant of human health. The disease burden through water results from water-associated communicable and non-communicable diseases and is influenced by water pollution with chemicals, solid waste (mainly plastics), pathogens, insects and other disease vectors. This paper analyses a range of water practitioner-driven health issues, including infectious diseases and chemical intoxication, using the conceptual framework of Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses (DPSIR), complemented with a selective literature review. Pressures in the environment result in changes in the State of the water body: chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the presence of vectors. These and other health hazards affect the State of human health. The resulting Impacts in an exposed population or affected ecosystem, in turn incite Responses. Pathways from Drivers to Impacts are quite divergent for chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in vectors of disease and for the combined effects of plastics. Potential Responses from the water sector, however, show remarkable similarities. Integrated water management interventions have the potential to address Drivers, Pressures, Impacts, and State of several health issues at the same time. Systematic and integrated planning and management of water resources, with an eye for human health, could contribute to reducing or preventing negative health impacts and enhancing the health benefits.","Boelee E., Geerling G., Van Der Zaan B., Blauw A., Vethaak A.D.",10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.011,Acta Tropica
Mg(2+)-Dependent Mechanism Of Environmental Versatility In A Multidrug Efflux Pump,"Tripartite resistance nodulation and cell division multidrug efflux pumps span the periplasm and are major drivers of multidrug resistance among gram-negative bacteria. Cations, such as Mg2+, become concentrated within the periplasm and, in contrast to the cytoplasm, its pH is sensitive to conditions outside the cell. Here, we reveal an interplay between Mg2+ and pH in modulating the structural dynamics of the periplasmic adapter protein, AcrA, and its function within the prototypical AcrAB-TolC multidrug pump from Escherichia coli. In the absence of Mg2+, AcrA becomes increasingly plastic within acidic conditions, but when Mg2+ is bound this is ameliorated, resulting instead in domain specific organization. We establish a unique histidine residue directs these dynamics and is essential for sustaining pump activity across acidic, neutral, and basic regimes. Overall, we propose Mg2+ conserves AcrA structural mobility to ensure optimal AcrAB-TolC function within rapidly changing environments commonly faced during bacterial infection and colonization.","Russell Lewis B., Uddin M.R., Kuo K.M., Shah L.M.N., Harris N.J., Booth P.J., Hammerschmid D., Gumbart J.C., Zgurskaya H.I., Reading E.",10.1016/j.str.2024.12.012,"Structure (London, England : 1993)"
Microbial Communities In Biosolids-Amended Soils: A Critical Review Of High-Throughput Sequencing Approaches,"Sustainable reuse of treated wastewater sludge or biosolids in agricultural production requires comprehensive understanding of their risks and benefits. Microbes are central mediators of many biosolids-associated risks and benefits, however understanding of their responses to biosolids remains minimal. Application of biosolids to soils amounts to a coalescence of two distinct microbial communities adapted to vastly different matrices. High-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing (HTS) approaches are required to accurately describe the compositional and functional outcomes of this process as they currently provide the highest possible resolution to deal with complex community-scale phenomena. Furthermore, linkage of HTS data to physicochemical and functional data can reveal biotic and abiotic drivers of coalescence, impacts of biosolids-borne contaminants and the collective downstream implications for soil and plant health. Here we review the current body of literature examining microbial communities in biosolids-amended soils using HTS of total community DNA and RNA. We provide a critical synthesis of soil microbial community composition and functional responses, the physical, chemical and biological drivers of these responses, and the influence of three major biosolids-borne anthropogenic contaminants of concern; antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance genes, plastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Finally, we identify methodological limitations and outstanding research questions precluding a holistic understanding of microbial responses in biosolids-amended soils and envision future research whereby sequence-based microbial ecology is integrated with soil, plant, and contaminant data to preserve soil health, support plant productivity, and remediate contaminants.","Reid C.J., Farrell M., Kirby J.K.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124203,Journal Of Environmental Management
In Treacherous Waters: Detection Of Colistin-Resistant Bacteria In Water And Plastic Litter From A Recreational Estuary,"Colistin resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge and resistant strains have now been reported worldwide. However, the occurrence of such bacteria in aquatic environments is considerably less understood. This study aimed to isolate and characterize colistin-resistant strains from water and plastic litter collected in an urban recreational estuary. Altogether, 64 strains with acquired colistin resistance were identified, mainly Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. From these, 40.6% were positive for at least one mcr variant (1-9), 26.5% harbored, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, 23.4% harbored, sulfonamide resistance genes, and 9.3% harbored, quinolone resistance genes. merA, encoding mercury resistance, was detected in 10.5% of these strains, most of which were also strong biofilm producers. The minimum inhibitory concentration toward colistin was determined for the mcr-positive strains and ranged from 2 to ≥512 μg ml(-1).

Can Low-Temperature Thermal Hydrolysis Mitigate The Oxidative Stress Of Polystyrene Nanoplastics On Anaerobic Digestion?,"The presence of micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) in sewage sludge has sparked considerable apprehensions over their potential negative effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) performance. The occurrence of MPs/NPs can trigger oxidative stress on the anaerobic microbiome, leading to potential inhibition of the AD process. While the thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is an extensively utilized sludge pretreatment method for AD, its impact on stress induced by MPs/NPs during AD remains poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the impacts of low-temperature THP (90 °C, 90 min) on AD of sewage sludge in the presence of 150 μg/L of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) under different solid retention times (SRTs) of 20, 15, and 10 d. The presence of PsNPs resulted in a higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Additionally, their presence caused a significant inhibition of methane production by 28.2%, 29.3%, and 38.8% for SRTs of 20, 15, and 10 d, respectively. Introducing low-temperature THP prior to the AD could partially recover methane production by mitigating ROS-induced stress and curbing the propagation of ARGs during the AD process. These results shed light on the potential benefits of THP and further optimization opportunities in alleviating the adverse effects of MPs/NPs-induced stress during sewage sludge AD.","Azizi S.M.M., Dhar B.R.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141516,Chemosphere

The P. aeruginosa bacteria exhibits remarkable genome plasticity that utilizes highly acquired and intrinsic resistance mechanisms to counter most antibiotic challenges. In addition, the adaptive antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa, including biofilm-mediated resistance and the formation of multidrug-tolerant persisted cells, are accountable for recalcitrance and relapse of infections. We highlighted the AMR mechanism considering the most common pathogen P. aeruginosa, its clinical impact, epidemiology, and save our souls (SOS)-mediated resistance. We further discussed the current therapeutic options against MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa infections, and described those treatment options in clinical practice.

Microplastics Affect The Ammonia Oxidation Performance Of Aerobic Granular Sludge And Enrich The Intracellular And Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as emerging pollutants, are frequently detected in wastewater treatment plants, and their threats to the environment have received extensive attentions. However, the effects of MPs on the nitrification of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and the spread patterns of intracellular and extracellular ARGs (iARGs and eARGs) in AGS were still unknown. In this study, the responses of AGS to the exposure of 1, 10 and 100 mg/L of typical MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE)) and tetracycline were focused on in 3 L nitrifying sequencing batch reactors. 10 mg/L MPs decreased the nitrification function, but nitrification could recover. Furthermore, MPs inhibited ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and enriched nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, leading partial nitrification to losing stability. PVC, PA and PS stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and reactive oxygen species. PE had less negative effect on AGS than PVC, PA and PS. The abundances of iARGs and eARGs (tetW, tetE and intI1) increased significantly and the intracellular and extracellular microbial communities obviously shifted in AGS system under MPs stress. Potential pathogenic bacteria might be the common hosts of iARGs and eARGs in AGS system and were enriched in AGS and MPs biofilms.","Wang Z., Gao J., Dai H., Zhao Y., Li D., Duan W., Guo Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124981,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Potential Effects Of Micro- And Nanoplastics On Phyllosphere Microorganisms And Their Evolutionary And Ecological Responses,"Plastic pollution is among the most urgent environmental and social challenges of the 21st century, and their influxes in the environment have altered critical growth drivers in all biomes, attracting global concerns. In particular, the consequences of microplastics on plants and their associated soil microorganisms have gained a large audience. On the contrary, how microplastics and nanoplastics (M/NPs) may influence the plant-associated microorganisms in the phyllosphere (i.e., the aboveground portion of plants) is nearly unknown. We, therefore, summarize evidence that may potentially connect M/NPs, plants, and phyllosphere microorganisms based on studies on other analogous contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and nanoparticles. We show seven pathways that may link M/NPs into the phyllosphere environment, and provide a conceptual framework explaining the direct and indirect (soil legacy) effects of M/NPs on phyllosphere microbial communities. We also discuss the adaptive evolutionary and ecological responses, such as acquiring novel resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer and microbial degradation of plastics of the phyllosphere microbial communities, to M/NPs-induced threats. Finally, we highlight the global consequences (e.g., disruption of ecosystem biogeochemical cycling and impaired host-pathogen defense chemistry that can lead to reduced agricultural productivity) of altered plant-microbiome interactions in the phyllosphere in the context of a predicted surge of plastic production and conclude with pending questions for future research priorities. In conclusion, M/NPs are very likely to produce significant effects on phyllosphere microorganisms and mediate their evolutionary and ecological responses.","Adomako M.O., Yu F.-H.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163760,Science Of The Total Environment
Deciphering The Pathogenic Risks Of Microplastics As Emerging Particulate Organic Matter In Aquatic Ecosystem,"Microplastics are accumulating rapidly in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitats for pathogens and vectors for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), potentially increasing pathogenic risks. However, few studies have considered microplastics as particulate organic matter (POM) to elucidate their pathogenic risks and underlying mechanisms. Here, we performed microcosm experiments with microplastics and natural POM (leaves, algae, soil), thoroughly investigating their distinct effects on the community compositions, functional profiles, opportunistic pathogens, and ARGs in Particle-Associated (PA) and Free-Living (FL) bacterial communities. We found that both microplastics and leaves have comparable impacts on microbial community structures and functions, enriching opportunistic pathogens and ARGs, which may pose potential environmental risks. These effects are likely driven by their influences on water properties, including dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, DO, and pH. However, microplastics uniquely promoted pathogens as keystone species and further amplified their capacity as hosts for ARGs, potentially posing a higher pathogenic risk than natural POM. Our research also emphasized the importance of considering both PA and FL bacteria when assessing microplastic impacts, as they exhibited different responses. Overall, our study elucidates the role and underlying mechanism of microplastics as an emerging POM in intensifying pathogenic risks of aquatic ecosystems in comparison with conventional natural POM.","Yin L.-Z., Luo X.-Q., Li J.-L., Liu Z., Duan L., Deng Q.-Q., Chen C., Tang S., Li W.-J., Wang P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134728,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Pathogenic Characteristics And Risk Factors For Eskape Pathogens Infection In Burn Patients,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the clinical manifestations, antimicrobial resis-tance, molecular characteristics, and risk factors for ESKAPE pathogens infection in burn patients. Methods: A retrospective study of 187 burn patients infected with ESKAPE pathogens was conducted at the Department of Plastic and Burn Surgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (Luzhou, China) from October 2018 to June 2021. All strains were identified using a MicroScan WalkAway 96 Plus System, and antimicrobial suscept-ibilities were determined using the VITEK system or the disk diffusion method. The antimicrobial resistance genes of multi-drug resistant ESKAPE (MDR-ESKAPE) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk factors for ESKAPE infection and MDR-ESKAPE infection. Results: A total of 255 strains were isolated in various types of clinical specimens from 187 burn patients, of which 47.5% were ESKAPE pathogens (121/255). Among these, MDR-ESKAPE pathogens accounted for 55% (67/121). Additionally, aph3III, mecA, bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(PDC), and bla(SHV) were the most prevalent genes detected in Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., respectively. The independent risk factors for ESKAPE infection were total body surface area (TBSA) >30–50% (odds ratio [OR] = 10.428; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.047 to 53.108), TBSA >50% (OR = 15.534; 95% CI, 1.489 to 162.021), and parenteral nutrition (OR = 3.597; 95% CI, 1.098 to 11.787). No independent risk factors were found for MDR-ESKAPE infection. Conclusion: Clinical staff should be alert to the risk of nosocomial infection with ESKAPE pathogens in burn patients receiving parenteral nutrition and under TBSA >30%. Full attention should also be paid to the ESKAPE resistance, strict adherence to infection control protocols for the rational use of antimicrobial agents, and enhanced clinical standardization of antimicrobial agents management.","Li Z., Xie J., Yang J., Liu S., Ding Z., Hao J., Ding Y., Zeng Z., Liu J.",10.2147/IDR.S338627,Infection And Drug Resistance
Covert Dissemination Of Plvpk-Like Virulence Plasmid In St29-K54 Klebsiella Pneumoniae: Emergence Of Low Virulence Phenotype Strains,"This study aimed to explore the epidemic, clinical characteristics, and molecular and virulence attributes of Klebsiella pneumoniae serotype K54 (K54-Kp). A retrospective study was conducted on 328 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae screened in a Chinese hospital from January 2016 to December 2019. The virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected by PCR, and a drug sensitivity test was adopted to detect drug resistance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PFGE were performed to determine the clonal correlation between isolates. Biofilm formation assay, serum complement-mediated killing, and Galleria mellonella infection were used to characterize the virulence potential. Our results showed that thirty strains of K54-Kp were screened from 328 strains of bacteria, with an annual detection rate of 2.29%. K54-Kp had a high resistance rate to antibiotics commonly used in the clinic, and patients with hepatobiliary diseases were prone to K54-Kp infection. MLST typing showed 10 sequence typing, mainly ST29 (11/30), which concentrated in the B2 cluster. K54-Kp primarily carried virulence genes of aerobactin, silS, allS, wcaG, wabG, and mrkD, among which the terW gene was closely related to ST29 (p<0.05). The strains infected by the bloodstream had strong biofilm formation ability (p<0.05). Most strains were sensitive to serum. Still, the virulence of pLVPK-like virulence plasmid in ST29-K54 Klebsiella pneumoniae was lower than that of ST11 type and NTUH-K2044 in the Galleria mellonella model. Therefore, these findings supply a foundation to roundly comprehend K54-Kp, and clinicians should strengthen supervision and attention.","Qiu J., Wei D., Ma J., Liu R., Shi J., Ren Q., Wei C., Huo B., Zhu L., Xiang T., Liu Y., Cheng N.",10.3389/fcimb.2023.1194133,Frontiers In Cellular And Infection Microbiology
"Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Chlortetracycline On The Intestinal Barrier, Gut Microbiota, And Antibiotic Resistome Of Muscovy Ducks (Cairina Moschata)","Antibiotics and microplastics (MPs) have become critical concerns worldwide because of their increasing amount and ecological risks to ecosystems. However, how MPs exposure affects the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in waterfowls remains poorly understood. In this study, Muscovy ducks were exposed to single and combined contamination with polystyrene MPs and chlortetracycline (CTC) for 56 days, and the effects of MPs on CTC bioaccumulation and their risks in duck intestines were investigated. MPs exposure reduced the bioaccumulation of CTC in the intestine and liver of ducks and increased their fecal CTC excretion. MPs exposure caused severe oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and intestinal barrier damages. Microbiome analysis showed that MPs exposure induced microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of Streptococcus and Helicobacter, the increase of which may exacerbate intestinal damages. Co-exposure to MPs and CTC alleviated the intestinal damage by regulating the gut microbiome. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the combined exposure to MPs and CTC increased the abundance of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Megamonas and incidence of total antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially tetracycline ARGs subtypes in the gut microbiota. The results obtained herein provide new insights into the potential risks of polystyrene MPs and antibiotics in waterfowls living in aquatic environments.","Liu B., Yu D., Ge C., Luo X., Du L., Zhang X., Hui C.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164050,Science Of The Total Environment
"Reliable And Reusable Whole Polypropylene Plastic Microfluidic Devices For A Rapid, Low-Cost Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test","Using an antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) as an example, this work demonstrates a practical method to fabricate microfluidic chips entirely from polypropylene (PP) and the benefits for potential commercial use. Primarily caused by the misuse and abuse of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to modern medicine. The AST is a promising technique to help with the optimal use of antibiotics for reducing AMR. However, current phenotypic ASTs suffer from long turnaround time, while genotypic ASTs suffer from low reliability, and both are unaffordable for routine use. New microfluidics based AST methods are rapid but still unreliable as well as costly due to the PDMS chip material. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient method to fabricate whole PP microfluidic chips with high resolution and fidelity. Unlike PDMS chips, the whole PP chips showed better reliability due to their inertness; they are solvent-compatible and can be conveniently reused and recycled, which largely decreases the cost, and are environmentally friendly. We specially designed 3D chambers that allow for quick cell loading without valving/liquid exchange; this new hydrodynamic design satisfies the shear stress requirement for on-chip bacterial culture, which, compared to reported designs for similar purposes, allows for a simpler, more rapid, and high-throughput operation. Our system allows for reliable tracking of individual cells and acquisition of AST results within 1-3 hours, which is among the group of fastest phenotypic methods. The PP chips are more reliable and affordable than PDMS chips, providing a practical solution to improve current culture-based AST and benefiting the fight against AMR through helping doctors prescribe effective, narrow-spectrum antibiotics; they will also be broadly useful for other applications wherein a reliable, solvent-resistant, anti-fouling, and affordable microfluidic chip is needed.","Sun H., Chan C.-W., Wang Y., Yao X., Mu X., Lu X., Zhou J., Cai Z., Ren K.",10.1039/c9lc00502a,Lab On A Chip
Ecotoxicological And Health Implications Of Microplastic-Associated Biofilms: A Recent Review And Prospect For Turning The Hazards Into Benefits,"Microplastics (MPs), over the years, have been regarded as a severe environmental nuisance with adverse effects on our ecosystem as well as human health globally. In recent times, microplastics have been reported to support biofouling by genetically diverse organisms resulting in the formation of biofilms. Biofilms, however, could result in changes in the physicochemical properties of microplastics, such as their buoyancy and roughness. Many scholars perceived the microplastic-biofilm association as having more severe consequences, providing evidence of its effects on the environment, aquatic life, and nutrient cycles. Furthermore, other researchers have shown that microplastic-associated biofilms have severe consequences on human health as they serve as vectors of heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite what is already known about their adverse effects, other interesting avenues are yet to be fully explored or developed to turn the perceived negative microplastic-biofilm association to our advantage. The major inclusion criteria for relevant literature were that it must focus on microplastic association biofilms, while we excluded papers solely on biofilms or microplastics. A total of 242 scientific records were obtained. More than 90% focused on explaining the environmental and health impacts of microplastic-biofilm association, whereas only very few studies have reported the possibilities and opportunities in turning the microplastic biofilms association into benefits. In summary, this paper concisely reviews the current knowledge of microplastic-associated biofilms and their adverse consequences and further proposes some approaches that can be developed to turn the negative association into positive.","Okeke E.S., Ezeorba T.P.C., Chen Y., Mao G., Feng W., Wu X.",10.1007/s11356-022-22612-w,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Interaction Of Micro(Nano)Plastics With Extracellular And Intracellular Biomolecules In The Freshwater Environment,"Plastic particles of diameters ranging from 1 nm to 5 mm are known as micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) and are frequently utilized in biomedical and consumer applications. As a result of unregulated disposal, physicochemical and biological degradation of plastic waste, MNPs are inevitably released into the aquatic environment and interact with extracellular biomolecules such as allochthonous and autochthonous natural organic matter (NOM), as well as intercellular biomolecules such as antibiotic resistance elements (AREs). Extracellular biomolecules are either degradation byproducts of NOM (e.g., humic acid-HA and fulvic acid-FA) or are produced by organisms as polymeric substances (e.g., DNA, carbohydrates, and proteins). After entering into the environment, MNPs may undergo encapsulation or coating by biomolecules, resulting in an eco-corona layer or bio-film formation, which alters the fate, bioreactivity, and possible environmental and human health consequences of plastic particles. With that said, this review summarized the research on the interaction of MNPs and biomolecules in the freshwater environment to highlight the sources, formation, and recent occurrence of MNPs in rivers and lakes, their interactions with extracellular and intercellular biomolecules, potential factors influencing those interactions, associated ecological and human health impacts, and last but not least, the current gaps and future research directions for a better understanding of the plastic particle-biomolecule interface and its implications under freshwater conditions.","Junaid M., Wang J.",10.1080/10643389.2021.2002078,Critical Reviews In Environmental Science And Technology
Development Of The Bacterial Spectrum And Antimicrobial Resistance In Surgical Site Infections Of Trauma Patients,"Background: While ubiquitously multi-resistant bacteria are on the rise, peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis in trauma and near-to-bone surgical procedures has only been changed slightly during the last 25 years. Recent clinical studies concerning the bacterial spectrum and efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in infected trauma surgical patients are rare. The aim of the study was analysis of the contemporary bacterial spectrum and its antimicrobial resistance including the assessment of the appropriateness of peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis with cefuroxime. Methods: Patients of a level-I academic trauma center who underwent open or arthroscopic surgery because of a recent trauma necessitating the use of bone-near metal implants were included in the study. All patients in whom a surgical site infection (SSI) had developed during six weeks post-operatively necessitating surgical debridement and had positive microbiologic culture results from an intra-operative surgical site swab were analyzed, retrospectively. In particular, age, gender, date and duration of surgical interventions, and patient's related risk factors were collected, and infecting agents and their minimum inhibitory concentration values for 34 selected antimicrobial agents were evaluated. An SSI occurring later than 6 weeks post-operatively and patients with chronic and septic wounds were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS® (IBM, Armonk, NY). Results: There were 438 pathogens cultured in specimens from 303 enrolled patients (female = 140, male = 163). The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (27.1%), S. epidermidis (20.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (13.6%), Escherichia coli (5.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.7%) accounting for 303 isolates. Of those, 89 (29.4%) were multi-resistant. Of the S. epidermidis isolates, 79.8% (n = 71) were resistant against Oxacillin and thus against most beta-lactam antibiotic agents. Altogether, only 44.1% of the infecting organisms were susceptible to cefuroxime, the antimicrobial agent most often being used for prophylactic purposes. Conclusion: Standardized antimicrobial prophylaxis with cephalosporins has to be reconsidered critically. Multi-resistant species such as S. epidermidis are an increasing challenge in trauma operations.","Eisner R., Lippmann N., Josten C., Rodloff A.C., Behrendt D.",10.1089/sur.2019.158,Surgical Infections
Combating Multidrug Resistance In Bacterial Infection By Targeting Functional Proteome With Natural Products,"Antibiotic resistance has become a major clinical and public health problem within the lifetime of most people living today. Development of new therapeutic approaches to prevent antimicrobial chemotherapy from bacterial multidrug resistance has thus been becoming a primary consideration in the medicinal community. In this study, we describe a protocol that is potential for combating multidrug resistance by rational screening of natural medicines to target the bacterial functional proteome. To achieve this, a pipeline of integrating virtual screening and susceptibility testing has been described to identify antibacterial agents from various natural products with diverse structures and high drug-likeness. A number of promising candidates with potent antibacterial activity were identified, from which six available compounds were assayed to determine their susceptibility to four multidrug-resistant strains. Consequently, while most tested candidates showed moderate (20 < MIC < 50 g/mL) or low (MIC>50 g/mL) antibacterial activities, two natural products, i.e. pseudopterosin A and ciprofloxacin, were measured to possess strong broad-spectrum potency combating different strains (MIC < 20 g/mL).","Xiong M., Guo Z., Han B., Chen M.",10.1080/14786419.2014.991926,Natural Product Research
Microplastic And Antibiotics In Waters: Interactions And Environmental Risks,"Antibiotics (ATs) are ubiquitously detected in natural waters worldwide, and their tendency to co-migrate with microplastics (MPs) post-adsorption leads to heightened environmental risk. Research on the adsorption of ATs on MPs and their subsequent effects on the environmental risks is gaining significant attention globally. This adsorption process predominantly occurs through hydrophobic forces, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions and is influenced by various environmental factors. The interaction between MPs and ATs exhibited varying degrees of efficiency across different pH levels and ionic strengths. Furthermore, this paper outlines the environmental risks associated with the co-presence of MPs and ATs in aquatic environments, emphasizing the potential effect of MPs on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and related environmental risks. The potential hazards posed by MPs and ATs in aquatic systems warrant serious consideration. Future research should concentrate on the adsorption of ATs/ARGs on MPs under real environmental conditions, horizontal gene transfer on MPs, as well as biofilm formation and agglomeration behavior on MPs that needs to be emphasized.","Guo J., Jin X., Zhou Y., Gao B., Li Y., Zhou Y.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123125,Journal Of Environmental Management
Antimicrobial Resistance In Bacterial Pathogens Among Hospitalised Patients With Severe Invasive Infections,"The most severe infections are invasive infections, due to the fact that the germs can accumulate in multiple sites and produce a body-wide infection known as sepsis. Septic shock has the highest mortality rate among non-traumatic medical conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of invasive infections in a hospital environment. Another second objective was to establish the aetiology of invasive infections in our hospital and the antibiotic resistance profile of the germs involved, which are both important for determining the therapeutic approach for the treatment of these infections. The study included 505 hospitalized patients from which we collected a total of 974 blood cultures. For the analysis of the blood cultures, we used an automated incubator. The bottles flagged as positive were subcultured on blood agar, and the grown colonies were identified using an identification system. Invasive infections had a prevalence rate of 27.72% in our hospital. From the 974 blood cultures, we isolated 170 bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 63 strains, 37.06%), Klebsiella spp. (27 strains, 15.88%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 18 strains, 10.59%), Enterococcus spp. (17 strains, 10.00%), Escherichia coli (12 strains, 7.06%), Streptococcus spp. (11 strains, 6.47%) and other bacterial species. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) in our study was 36.51% from the SA strains. The MRSA prevalence differed significantly according to age (37.50% in adults vs. 28.57% in children, P=0.047) and ICU admission (42.42% in ICU patients vs. 30.00% in non-ICU patients, P=0.018). We performed a multivariate analysis of the invasive infection risk which detected as significant predictors the admission into the cardiology ward and plastic surgery ward. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that the high prevalence of Gram-positive cocci in blood cultures, mostly SA, with multidrug resistance has important consequences for the management of invasive infections.","Zlatian O., Balasoiu A.T., Balasoiu M., Cristea O., Docea A.O., Mitrut R., Spandidos D.A., Tsatsakis A.M., Bancescu G., Calina D.",10.3892/etm.2018.6737,Experimental And Therapeutic Medicine
"Antibiotic Sorption Onto Mps In Terrestrial Environment: A Critical Review Of The Transport, Bioaccumulation, Ecotoxicological Effects And Prospects","Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are prevalent contaminants in terrestrial environment. MPs possess the ability to absorb antibiotics, resulting in the formation of complex pollutants. While the accumulation and fate of MPs and antibiotics in marine ecosystems have been extensively studied, their combined pollution behavior in terrestrial environments remains relatively underexplored. This paper describes the sources, migration, and compound pollution of MPs and antibiotics in soil. It reviews the mechanisms of compound toxicity associated with antibiotics and MPs, combining different biological classifications. Moreover, we highlight the factors that influence the effects of MPs as vectors and the critical elements driving the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). These information suggests the potential mitigation measures for MPs contamination from different perspectives to reduce the impact of ARGs-carrying MPs on human health, specifically through transmission via plants, microbes, or terrestrial vertebrates. Finally, we identify gaps in scientific knowledge regarding the interaction between MPs and antibiotics in soil environments, including the need for standardized research methods, multi-dimensional studies on complex ecological effects, and more comprehensive risk assessments of other pollutants on human health. In summary, this paper provides foundational information for assessing their combined toxicity, offers insights into the distribution of these emerging pollutants in soil, and contributes to a better understanding of the environmental impact of these contaminants.","Du J., Zhan L., Zhang G., Zhou Q., Wu W.",10.1080/01480545.2024.2433075,Drug And Chemical Toxicology

"Biofilm Formation, Virulence And Antimicrobial Resistance Of Different Campylobacter Jejuni Isolates From A Poultry Slaughterhouse","The fastidious requirement of the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni contrasts with its ability to overcome harsh conditions. Different strategies might be involved in the survival and persistence of C. jejuni through the poultry food chain. Therefore, the aims of this study were to get insights in the survival strategies in the poultry slaughterhouse environment by (i) characterizing factors such as biofilm formation, virulence and antimicrobial resistance in environmental isolates and (ii) understanding the possible link between the phenotypic and genetic characterization using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results have shown that three STs: ST 443 (PFGE A), ST 904 (PFGE C) and ST 3769 (PFGE G), out of the six studied, formed biofilms with variable intensity according to different conditions (temperatures -37 °C, 30 °C, 25°C- and materials -stainless steel and plastic-). High levels of antimicrobial resistance were found in isolates to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline as well as to two common detergents used in the slaughterhouse. A combination of several changes in the genome of ST 904 (PFGE C) including mutations, insertions in antimicrobial resistance genes, the presence of T6SS and a set of genes related to virulence factors might explain its ability to form biofilm and persist longer in the environment. However, the complexity of the survival strategies adopted by the different strains of C. jejuni suggests that multiple mechanisms may exist that allow these organisms to persist and ultimately cause disease in humans.","García-Sánchez L., Melero B., Jaime I., Rossi M., Ortega I., Rovira J.",10.1016/j.fm.2019.05.016,Food Microbiology
Epidemiology Of Staphylococcus Aureus In A Burn Unit Of A Tertiary Care Center In Ghana,"Background In developing countries, hospitalized burn victims are at high risk of nosocomial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors include poor infection control practices, prolonged hospitalisation and limited capacity for laboratory microbiological analyses. These problems are compounded by widespread use of antibiotics that drives the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria. Methods During the study period (November 2014-June 2015), nasal and invasive S. aureus isolates were collected consecutively from patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) within the burn unit of the Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burn Center of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Antibiotic prescription, antibiotic susceptibility and bacterial typing were used to assess antibiotic pressure, antibiotic resistance, and possible transmission events among patients and HCWs. Results Eighty S. aureus isolates were obtained from 37 of the 62 included burn patients and 13 of the 29 HCWs. At admission, 50% of patients carried or were infected with S. aureus including methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Antibiotic use per 100 days of hospitalization was high (91.2 days), indicating high selective pressure for resistant pathogens. MRSA isolates obtained from 11 patients and one HCW belonged to the same spa-type t928 and multi-locus sequence type 250, implying possible transmission events. A mortality rate of 24% was recorded over the time of admission in the burn unit. Conclusion This study revealed a high potential for MRSA outbreaks and emergence of resistant pathogens amongst burn patients due to lack of patient screening and extended empirical use of antibiotics. Our observations underscore the need to implement a system of antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention where microbiological diagnostics results are made available to physicians for timely and appropriate patient treatment.","Amissah N.A., Van Dam L., Ablordey A., Ampomah O.-W., Prah I., Tetteh C.S., Van Der Werf T.S., Friedrich A.W., Rossen J.W., Van Dijl J.M., Stienstra Y.",10.1371/journal.pone.0181072,Plos One

Comparison Of Methods For Quantitating Salmonella Enterica Typhimurium And Heidelberg Strain Attachment To Reusable Plastic Shipping Container Coupons And Preliminary Assessment Of Sanitizer Efficacy,"Salmonella serovars, one of the leading contributors to foodborne illness and are especially problematic for foods that are not cooked before consumption, such as fresh produce. The shipping containers that are used to transport and store fresh produce may play a role in cross contamination and subsequent illnesses. However, methods for quantitatively attached cells are somewhat variable. The overall goal of this study was to compare conventional plating with molecular methods for quantitating attached representative strains for Salmonella Typhimurium and Heidelberg on reusable plastic containers (RPC) coupons, respectively. We attached Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and serovar Heidelberg SL486 (parent and an antibiotic resistant marker strain) to plastic coupons (2.54 cm(2)) derived from previously used shipping containers by growing for 72 h in tryptic soy broth. The impact of the concentration of sanitizer on log reductions between unsanitized and sanitized coupons was evaluated by exposing attached S. Typhimurium cells to 200 ppm and 200,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Differences in sanitizer effectiveness between serovars were also evaluated with attached S. Typhimurium compared to attached S. Heidelberg populations after being exposed to 200 ppm peracetic acid (PAA). Treatment with NaClO caused an average of 2.73 ± 0.23 log CFU of S. Typhimurium per coupon removed with treatment at 200 ppm while 3.36 ± 0.54 log CFU were removed at 200,000 ppm. Treatment with PAA caused an average of 2.62 ± 0.15 log CFU removed for S. Typhimurium and 1.41 ± 0.17 log CFU for S. Heidelberg (parent) and 1.61 ± 0.08 log CFU (marker). Lastly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize cell attachment and coupon surface topography. SEM images showed that remaining attached cell populations were visible even after sanitizer application. Conventional plating and qPCR yielded similar levels of enumerated bacterial populations indicating a high concordance between the two methods. Therefore, qPCR could be used for the rapid quantification of Salmonella attached on RPC.","Shi Z., Baker C.A., Lee S.I., Park S.H., Kim S.A., Ricke S.C.",10.1080/03601234.2016.1181905,"Journal Of Environmental Science And Health.

"The Acinetobacter Baumannii Two-Component System Aders Regulates Genes Required For Multidrug Efflux, Biofilm Formation, And Virulence In A Strain-Specific Manner","The opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is able to persist in the environment and is often multidrug resistant (MDR), causing difficulties in the treatment of infections. Here, we show that the two-component system AdeRS, which regulates the production of the AdeABC multidrug resistance efflux pump, is required for the formation of a protective biofilm in an ex vivo porcine mucosal model, which mimics a natural infection of the human epithelium. Interestingly, deletion of adeB impacted only on the ability of strain AYE to form a biofilm on plastic and only on the virulence of strain Singapore 1 for Galleria mellonella. RNA-Seq revealed that loss of AdeRS or AdeB significantly altered the transcriptional landscape, resulting in the changed expression of many genes, notably those associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence interactions. For example, A. baumannii lacking AdeRS displayed decreased expression of adeABC, pil genes, com genes, and a pgaC-like gene, whereas loss of AdeB resulted in increased expression of pil and com genes and decreased expression of ferric acinetobactin transport system genes. These data define the scope of AdeRS-mediated regulation, show that changes in the production of AdeABC mediate important phenotypes controlled by AdeRS, and suggest that AdeABC is a viable target for antimicrobial drug and antibiofilm discovery. IMPORTANCE Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen and is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide. This organism is often multidrug resistant, can persist in the environment, and forms a biofilm on environmental surfaces and wounds. Overproduction of efflux pumps can allow specific toxic compounds to be pumped out of the cell and can lead to multidrug resistance. This study demonstrates the role of the A. baumannii efflux pump AdeB, and its regulator AdeRS, in multidrug resistance, epithelial cell killing, and biofilm formation. Deletion of the genes encoding these systems led to increased susceptibility to antibiotics, decreased biofilm formation on biotic and abiotic surfaces, and decreased virulence. Our data suggest that inhibition of AdeB could prevent biofilm formation or colonization in patients by A. baumannii and provides a good target for drug discovery.","Richmond G.E., Evans L.P., Anderson M.J., Wand M.E., Bonney L.C., Ivens A., Chua K.L., Webber M.A., Mark Sutton J., Peterson M.L., Piddock L.J.V.",10.1128/mBio.00430-16,Mbio
Deep-Sea Sediment Metagenome From Bay Of Bengal Reveals Distinct Microbial Diversity And Functional Significance,"Bay of Bengal (BoB) has immense significance with respect to ecological diversity and natural resources. Studies on microbial profiling and their functional significance at sediment level of BoB remain poorly represented. Herein, we describe the microbial diversity and metabolic potentials of BOB deep-sea sediment samples by subjecting the metagenomes to Nanopore sequencing. Taxonomic diversity ascertained at various levels revealed that bacteria belonging to phylum Proteobacteria predominantly represented in sediment samples NIOT_S7 and NIOT_S9. A comparative study with 16S datasets from similar ecological sites revealed depth as a crucial factor in determining taxonomic diversity. KEGG annotation indicated that bacterial communities possess sequence reads corresponding to carbon dioxide fixation, sulfur, nitrogen metabolism, but at varying levels. Additionally, gene sequences related to bioremediation of dyes, plastics, hydrocarbon, antibiotic resistance, secondary metabolite synthesis and metal resistance from both the samples as studied indicate BoB to represent a highly diverse environmental niche for further exploration.","Marimuthu J., Rangamaran V.R., Subramanian S.H.S., Balachandran K.R.S., Thenmozhi Kulasekaran N., Vasudevan D., Lee J.-K., Ramalingam K., Gopal D.",10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110524,Genomics
Mandibular Osteoradionecrosis: Defining The Microbial Milieu And Antimicrobial Resistance At The Time Of Rescue Flap Surgery,"Objective: To report the microorganisms and their antibiotic sensitivity profile from tissue cultures and stains at the time of anterolateral thigh fascia lata (ALTFL) rescue flap for management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent ALTFL rescue flap for native mandibular ORN between 2011 and 2022. Results: Twenty-six cases comprising 24 patients (mean age 65.4 years, 65.4% male) with mandibular ORN from whom tissue cultures and gram stain were obtained at the time of ALTFL rescue flap. 57.7% grew bacterial species, while 34.6% grew fungal species. Multibacterial speciation was noted in 26.9% of cultures. A combination of bacterial and fungal growth was also seen in 15.4% of cases. All gram-positive cocci (GPC) were pansensitive to antibiotics except for one case of Staphylococcus aureus, which was resistant to levofloxacin. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) species were isolated in 50.0% of cases. All fungal growth was due to Candida species. No growth was noted in 23.1% of cases. Multidrug resistance was noted in 53.8% of cases when GNB was isolated. Conclusion: We report 76.9% of our cases of mandibular ORN had microbial growth from tissue cultures obtained at the time of the ALTFL rescue flap. Fungal growth was noted in a substantial number of cases and should be obtained as a specimen when pursuing culture-driven antibiotic therapy. Most GPCs were pansensitive to antibiotics, while GNBs were often the harbinger of multidrug resistant mandibular ORN.

Exposure To Microplastics Reduces The Bioaccumulation Of Sulfamethoxazole But Enhances Its Effects On Gut Microbiota And The Antibiotic Resistome Of Mice,"Microplastics (MPs) have aroused a global health concern and their coexistence with antibiotics is inevitable. However, how MPs would affect the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in humans remains poorly understood. Here a mouse model was used, and through dietary exposure, we observed that while the relative distributions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in tissues were relatively stable, MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues (liver, lung, spleen, heart and kidney). Notably, while SMX and MPs showed a differential effect, MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, with the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes and multidrug genes being significantly increased. We further identified that shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice. Combined, our results demonstrate that MPs reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX, but they enhanced its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice, indicating they might have high risks to humans.","Liu J., Lv M., Sun A., Ding J., Wang Y., Chang X., Chen L.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133810,Chemosphere
A Case Of Leg Cellulitis Caused By Multidrug-Resistant Streptococcus Pseudoporcinus,"A 94-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 5-day history of painful redness in the left lower leg. She was diagnosed with cellulitis and initiated antibiotic therapy with cefazolin. After two days, she presented with an extremely high fever (39.9°C), high C-reactive protein level (256 mg/L; normal, < 3), and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In bacteriological examination, Streptococcus pseudoporcinus was detected from her lower leg wound purulence. An antibiogram revealed multidrug resistance except for cefepime, carbapenems, and vancomycin. We changed the antibiotics to cefepime and vancomycin according to the antibiogram and administered immunoglobulin concurrently. As the result of these therapies, her conditions gradually resolved over two weeks. S. pseudoporcinus, one of the β-hemolytic Streptococcus species recently described, has been isolated from the genitourinary tract of women. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cellulitis caused by S. pseudoporcinus. Typically, most antibiotics indicate adequate drug susceptibilities of S. pseudoporcinus, but in our case, multidrug resistance contributed to the prolonged duration of treatment. Because the colonization of S. pseudoporcinus in healthy individuals is not rare, it could become an important pathogen in elderly people and in those who have underlying medical conditions, as with other β-hemolytic Streptococci.","Sawamura S., Niimori D., Ihn H.",10.5582/irdr.2018.01110,Intractable And Rare Diseases Research
Multidrug Resistant Aeromonas Infection Following Medical Leech Therapy: A Case Report And Development Of A Joint Antimicrobial Stewardship And Infection Prevention Protocol,"Objective: Aeromonas sp. infections are a recognized complication of medical leech therapy (MLT). In patients requiring MLT, ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole are commonly used to prevent such nosocomial infections. After a patient at our institution developed a MLT-associated multi-drug resistant (MDR) Aeromonas infection, we developed and evaluated a joint antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention protocol for MLT at our institution. Methods: We describe a case of a surgical site infection with MDR Aeromonas following MLT that was resistant to typically prescribed prophylactic antimicrobials, and development of a new leech culture protocol to proactively monitor for antimicrobial resistance among our institution's leech supply. We also report the rates of MLT-associated infections prior to and following implementation of this protocol and the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles detected in leech culture at our institution. Results: Between October 2014 and February 2018, 46 patients received MLT at our institution. Other than the case described in this report, no other instances of MLT-related infections were noted during this time period. Culture results from 22 leeches in six batches since February 2018 showed that all were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, TMP-SMX, and ceftriaxone. Since initiation of a leech culture protocol, no further cases of MLT-associated infections have been reported at our institution. Conclusions: In light of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the potentially devastating consequences of MLT-associated infections, institutions offering MLT should be aware of these risks and ensure that protocols are in place to minimize infection risks for patients.","Masters M.C., Gupta A.R., Rhodes N.J., Flaherty J.P., Zembower T.R., Alghoul M., Krueger K.M.",10.1016/j.jgar.2020.10.010,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
"Interaction Of Microplastics With Antibiotics In Aquatic Environment: Distribution, Adsorption, And Toxicity","As two major types of pollutants of emerging concerns, microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics (ATs) coexist in aquatic environments, and their interactions are a source of increasing concern. Therefore, this work examines the interaction mechanisms of MPs and ATs, and the effect of MPs on ATs bioavailability and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) abundance in aquatic environments. First, the mechanisms for ATs adsorption on MPs are summarized, mainly including hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and electrostatic interactions. But other possible mechanisms, such as halogen bonding, CH/π interaction, cation−π interaction, and negative charge-assisted hydrogen bonds, are newly proposed to explain the observed ATs adsorption. Additionally, environmental factors (such as pH, ionic strength, dissolved organic matters, minerals, and aging conditions) affecting ATs adsorption by MPs are specifically discussed. Moreover, MPs could change the bioaccumulation and toxicity of ATs to aquatic organisms, and the related mechanisms on the joint effect are reviewed and analyzed. Furthermore, MPs can enrich ARGs from the surrounding environment, and the effect of MPs on ARGs abundance is evaluated. Finally, research challenges and perspectives for MPs-ATs interactions and related environmental implications are presented. This review will facilitate a better understanding of the environmental fate and risk of both MPs and ATs.","Wang Y., Yang Y., Liu X., Zhao J., Liu R., Xing B.",10.1021/acs.est.1c04509,Environmental Science And Technology
Impact Of Polystyrene Nanoplastics On Primary Sludge Fermentation Under Acidic And Alkaline Conditions: Significance Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"As a part of industrial or commercial discharge, the influx of nanoplastics (NPs) to the wastewater treatment plants is inevitable. Consequently, it has become a must to understand the effects of these NPs on different unit processes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of three different concentrations of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) on the fermentation of primary sludge (PrS), implemented in batch anaerobic bioreactors, at pH 5 and 10, considering the pH-dependent nature of the fermentation process. The results showed that PsNPs stimulated hydrogen gas production at a lower dose (50 μg/L), while a significant gas suppression was denoted at higher concentrations (150 μg/L, 250 μg/L). In both acidic and alkaline conditions, propionic and acetic acid predominated, respectively, followed by n-butyric acid. Under both acidic and alkaline conditions, exposure to PsNPs boosted the propagation of various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including tetracycline, macrolide, β-lactam and sulfonamide resistance genes, and integrons. Notably, under alkaline condition, the abundance of sul2 gene in the 250 μg PsNPs/L batch exhibited a 2.4-fold decrease compared to the control batch. The response of the microbial community to PsNPs exposure exhibited variations at different pH values. Bacteroidetes prevailed at both pH conditions, with their relative abundance increasing after PsNPs exposure, indicating a positive impact of PsNPs on PrS solubilization. Adverse impacts, however, were detected in Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria. The observed variations in the survival rates of various microbes stipulate that they do not have the same tolerance levels under different pH conditions.","Saila R., Zakaria B.S., Mirsoleimani Azizi S.M., Mostafa A., Dhar B.R.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142777,Chemosphere
Single-Use Polyethylene Terephthalate Bottle-Derived Nanoplastics Propagate Antibiotic Resistance In Bacteria Via Transformation And Outer Membrane Vesicle Secretion,"Plastic pollution arising from single-use plastic bottles (SUPBs) and containers leads to the formation of micro/nanoplastics (NPs). These NPs raise concerns due to their potential toxicity and interactions with microorganisms. In various environments, including our digestive system, both microorganisms and plastics coexist. The interactions between these NPs and microorganisms can have far-reaching consequences, potentially affecting the ecosystems and human health. Therefore, understanding these interactions is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by plastic pollution. This study investigated the role of NPs in propagating antibiotic resistance (AR), specifically through outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which is a mechanism that has not been fully explored to date in terms of NPs' effects. To explore this, NPs were synthesized using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) SUPBs, mimicking the natural chemical composition of environmental nanoplastics, unlike previous studies, which used pure PET, polystyrene (PS) or other pure plastic materials. The resulting PET bottle-derived nanoplastics (PBNPs), which exhibited diverse shapes and sizes (50-850 nm), were found to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through transformation and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), enabling the transport of plasmids among bacteria. In transformation, PBNPs physically carried plasmids across the bacterial membrane. In another scenario, PBNPs induced oxidative stress and bacterial surface damage, which led to the upregulation of stress response-associated genes and the escalation of OMV secretion in E. coli. This novel pathway highlights how PBNPs contribute to AR gene dissemination, potentially exacerbating the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Furthermore, PBNPs mediate cross-species gene transfer from E. coli to Lactobacillus acidophilus, underscoring their impact on diverse microorganisms, including those in the human gut. Our findings suggest that nanoplastics may be an unrecognized contributor to the rising tide of antibiotic resistance, with significant consequences for human health and the environment. Molecular analyses revealed the upregulated expression of genes associated with stress response and OMV secretion, offering deeper insights into the biological mechanisms affected by PBNPs. This study offers crucial insights into the interactions of NPs and microorganisms for developing strategies to address the ecological and health implications of nanoplastic contamination.","Sharma P., Kishore A., Singh M.",10.1039/d4nr02613f,Nanoscale
A Combination Of Preoperative Or Intraoperative Mb-Pdt And Surgery In The Treatment Of Giant Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma With Infection,"Background: Giant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) with infection is a major clinical issue, as the infection not only promotes the progress of tumor, but also effects the success of surgery. Traditional antibiotic treatment is not always sufficient to clear the infection, especially for cSCC infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has broad-spectral antibacterial activity and non-selective pressure, which makes it difficult to induce antibiotic resistance. Here, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT, along with photosensitizers MB (Methylene blue) – in the treatment of cSCC infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Methods: In our study, 6 patients with giant csCC accompanied infection were diagnosed by pathological examination and the depth of tumor tissues was examined by X-Ray or MRI. All patients’ tumor wounds were firstly irradiated with MB-PDT (635 nm, 120 J/cm(2), 100 mW/cm(2)) using the red LED to control the infection. After the control of infection was confirmed by the culture of secretion, tumor underwent expanded resection. Multi-point pathological monitoring was performed during the operation to assure that there was no residual tumor tissue on the wound, and the primary or secondary repair was performed according to the condition of the wound. If the wound requires the tissue flaps transplation in secondary stage, the wound was irradiated again with intraoperative MB-PDT to remove the possible residual tumor cells, as well as to prevent wound infection. All patients were followed up for 0.8–3 years after flap transplation. Results: In 6 patients, the cSCC infection was completely controlled by MB-PDT, and the flap survival was 100%. There was no recurrence of cSCC in the follow-up of 1.6 years (range, 0.8–3 years) after the comminated treatment with MB-PDT and surgery. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant bacteria could efficiently be killed by MB-PDT, and the combination of surgery with MB-PDT is a safe and effective approach for treating giant cSCC with infection.","Xu L., Li X., Zhao C., Zhang X., Kou H., Yang Y., Zhu F., Zhang W., Lu Y.",10.1016/j.pdpdt.2021.102545,Photodiagnosis And Photodynamic Therapy
Washer Disinfector And Alkaline Detergent Efficacy Against C. Difficile On Plastic Bedpans,"Background: Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of infectious antibiotic resistant diarrhea. C. difficile spores are shed in patient stool, are hearty and difficult to kill. Bedpans are often used by patients with C. difficile infections and require proper handling and cleaning or disposal to prevent the transmission of C. difficile spores and other infectious microorganisms into the environment. Disposable bedpans are often used for convenience, which has consequences from an environmental sustainability perspective. Aim: This study evaluates the ability for a washer-disinfector device (WD) to efficaciously clean and disinfect C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli from bedpans for sanitary reuse. Methods: A commercially available WD device was evaluated for both efficacy and thermal disinfection against C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli using one disinfection cycle per test. Bedpans were not rinsed or dumped prior to placement in the WD. Bedpans were sampled using swabs. Microorganisms were eluted from the swabs and log-kill was calculated. Findings: The average log-kill for C. difficile spores was 3.99 and >7.69 for E. coli. Thermal disinfection results showed an average log kill of 4.31 for C. difficile and >7.23 for E. coli. Conclusions: The WD was efficacious against both C. difficile spores and E. coli when used according to manufacturer's instructions for use, suggesting a viable alternative to disposable bedpan waste management.","Hatt S., Schindler B., Bach D., Greene C.",10.1016/j.ajic.2019.11.028,American Journal Of Infection Control
Development And Validation Of Apoptosis-Related Signature And Molecular Subtype To Improve Prognosis Prediction In Osteosarcoma Patients,"Background: Previous evidence has shown that apoptosis performs integral functions in the tumorigenesis and development of various tumors. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a molecular subtype and prognostic signature based on apoptosis-related genes (ARGs) to understand the molecular mechanisms and predict prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma. Methods: The GEO and TARGET databases were utilized to obtain the expression levels of ARGs and clinical information of osteosarcoma patients. Consensus clustering analysis was used to explore the different molecular subtypes based on ARGs. GO, KEGG, GSEA, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA analyses were performed to examine the differences in biological functions and immune characteristics between the distinct molecular subtypes. Then, we constructed an ARG signature by LASSO analysis. The prognostic significance of the ARG signature in osteosarcoma was determined by Kaplan–Meier plotter, Cox regression, and nomogram analyses. Results: Two apoptosis-related subtypes were identified. Cluster 1 had a better prognosis, higher immunogenicity, and immune cell infiltration, as well as a better response to immunotherapy than Cluster 2. We discovered that patients in the high-risk cohort had a lower survival rate than those in the low-risk cohort according to the ARG signature. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis confirmed that a high risk score independently acted as an unfavorable prognostic marker. Additionally, the nomogram combining risk scores with clinical characteristics can improve prediction efficiency. Conclusion: We demonstrated that patients suffering from osteosarcoma may be classified into two apoptosis-related subtypes. Moreover, we developed an ARG prognostic signature to predict the prognosis status of osteosarcoma patients.","Hong J., Li Q., Wang X., Li J., Ding W., Hu H., He L.",10.1002/jcla.24501,Journal Of Clinical Laboratory Analysis
Enhanced Bacterial Adhesion Force By Rifampicin Resistance Promotes Microbial Colonization On Pe Plastic Compared To Non-Resistant Biofilm Formation,"The microbial biofilm formed on plastics, is ubiquitous in the environment. However, the effects of antibiotic resistance on the development of the biofilm on plastics, especially with regard to initial cell attachment, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the initial bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth of a rifampin (Rif) resistant E. coli (RRE) and a normal gram-positive B. subtilis on a typical plastic (polyethylene, PE). The experiments were conducted in different antibiotic solutions, including Rif, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and kanamycin (KM), with concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 μg/L to simulate different aquatic environments. The AFM-based single-cell adhesion force determination revealed that Rif resistance strengthened the adhesion force of RRE to PE in the environment rich in Rif rather than SMX and KM. The enhanced adhesion force may be due to the higher secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), particularly proteins, by RRE in the presence of Rif compared to the other two antibiotics. In addition, the higher ATP level of RRE would facilitate the initial adhesion and subsequent biofilm growth. Transcriptome analysis of RRE separately cultured in Rif and SMX environments demonstrated a clear correlation between the expression of Rif resistance and the augmented bacterial adhesion and cellular activity. Biofilm biomass analysis confirmed the promotion effect of Rif resistance on biofilm growth when compared to non-resistant biofilms, establishing a novel association with the augmentation of microbial adhesion force. Our study highlights concerns related to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance during microbial colonization on plastic that may arise from antibiotic resistance.","Wu J., Liu C., Wang R., Yan S., Chen B., Zhu X.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.120319,Water Research
"Effects Of Polyvinylchloride Microplastics On The Toxicity Of Nanoparticles And Antibiotics To Aerobic Granular Sludge: Nitrogen Removal, Microbial Community And Resistance Genes","Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) have ecological risk to humans and ecosystems. Polyvinylchloride microplastics (PVC MPs), as a representative of microplastics, may often coexist with CuO NPs and CIP in wastewater treatment systems due to their widespread application. However, the co-impact of PVC MPs in wastewater systems contained with CuO NPs and CIP on nitrogen removal and ecological risk is not clear. In this work, PVC MPs co-impacts on the toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP to aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems and potential mechanisms were investigated. 10 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition did not significantly affect the nitrogen removal, but it definitely changed the microbial community structure and enhanced the propagation and horizontal transfer of antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). 100 mg/L PVC MPs co-addition resulted in a raise of CuO NP toxicity to the AGS system, but reduced the co-toxicity of CuO NPs and CIP and ARGs expression. The co-impacts with different PVC MPs concentration influenced Cu(2+) concentrations, cell membrane integrity, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) contents and microbial communities in AGS systems, and lead to a change of nitrogen removal.","Li Y.-Q., Zhao B.-H., Zhang Y.-Q., Zhang X.-Y., Chen X.-T., Yang H.-S.",10.1016/j.envres.2023.117151,Environmental Research
Unignorable Environmental Risks: Insight Into Differential Responses Between Biofilm And Plastisphere In Sulfur Autotrophic Denitrification System Upon Exposure To Quaternary Ammonium Compounds,"Concerns of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and microplastics (MPs) as emerging containments accumulating in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have attracted much attention. Plastisphere with distinctive microbial communities might also be the repository for pathogens and resistance genes (RGs). Thus, the effects of three representative QACs with different concentrations on biofilm and plastisphere were studied in sulfur autotrophic denitrification (SAD) system. Over 100 days, 1–5 mg/L QACs exerted few impacts on system stability, whereas 15 mg/L QACs seriously lowered the microbial activity and the inhibitory effects ranked: benzylalkyldimethylethyl ammonium compound > dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound > alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound. Dosing of QACs in SAD system not only altered the microbial community structure and assembly, but also induced higher levels of intracellular RGs and extracellular RGs in plastisphere than in biofilm. Although the free RGs abundances in water slightly lowered, they might also pose great ecological risks. Pathogens identified as the potential hosts of RGs were more prone to colocalizing in plastisphere. Mobile genetic elements directly contributed to the three-fraction RGs transmission in SAD system. This study offered new insights into the differential responses of biofilm and plastisphere under QACs stress and guided for the disinfectants and MPs pollution containment in WWTPs.","Wang Y., Gao J., Wang Z., Zhao Y., Wang H., Guo Y., Yuan Y., Chen H.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.137231,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Transmission In A Ghanaian Burn Unit: The Importance Of Active Surveillance In Resource-Limited Settings,"Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus infections in burn patients can lead to serious complications and death. The frequency of S. aureus infection is high in low- and middle-income countries presumably due to limited resources, misuse of antibiotics and poor infection control. The objective of the present study was to apply population genomics to precisely define, for the first time, the transmission of antibiotic resistant S. aureus in a resource-limited setting in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Staphylococcus aureus surveillance was performed amongst burn patients and healthcare workers during a 7-months survey within the burn unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Results: Sixty-six S. aureus isolates (59 colonizing and 7 clinical) were obtained from 31 patients and 10 healthcare workers. Twenty-one of these isolates were ST250-IV methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Notably, 25 (81%) of the 31 patients carried or were infected with S. aureus within 24 h of admission. Genome comparisons revealed six distinct S. aureus clones circulating in the burn unit, and demonstrated multiple transmission events between patients and healthcare workers. Further, the collected S. aureus isolates exhibited a wide range of genotypic resistances to antibiotics, including trimethoprim (21%), aminoglycosides (33%), oxacillin (33%), chloramphenicol (50%), tetracycline (59%) and fluoroquinolones (100%). Conclusion: Population genomics uncovered multiple transmission events of S. aureus, especially MRSA, within the investigated burn unit.

Genomic Landscape Of Ndm-1 Producing Multidrug-Resistant Providencia Stuartii Causing Burn Wound Infections In Bangladesh,"The increasing antimicrobial resistance in Providencia stuartii (P. stuartii) worldwide, particularly concerning for immunocompromised and burn patients, has raised concern in Bangladesh, where the significance of this infectious opportunistic pathogen had been previously overlooked, prompting a need for investigation. The two strains of P. stuartii (P. stuartii SHNIBPS63 and P. stuartii SHNIBPS71) isolated from wound swab of two critically injured burn patients were found to be multidrug-resistant and P. stuartii SHNIBPS63 showed resistance to all the 22 antibiotics tested as well as revealed the co-existence of blaVEB-6 (Class A), blaNDM-1 (Class B), blaOXA-10 (Class D) beta lactamase genes. Complete resistance to carbapenems through the production of NDM-1, is indicative of an alarming situation as carbapenems are considered to be the last line antibiotic to combat this pathogen. Both isolates displayed strong biofilm-forming abilities and exhibited resistance to copper, zinc, and iron, in addition to carrying multiple genes associated with metal resistance and the formation of biofilms. The study also encompassed a pangenome analysis utilizing a dataset of eighty-six publicly available P. stuartii genomes (n = 86), revealing evidence of an open or expanding pangenome for P. stuartii. Also, an extensive genome-wide analysis of all the P. stuartii genomes revealed a concerning global prevalence of diverse antimicrobial resistance genes, with a particular alarm raised over the abundance of carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM-1.

"Unraveling The Nexus: Microplastics, Antibiotics, And Args Interactions, Threats And Control In Aquaculture – A Review","In recent years, aquaculture has expanded rapidly to address food scarcity and provides high-quality aquatic products. However, this growth has led to the release of significant effluents, containing emerging contaminants like antibiotics, microplastics (MPs), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigated the occurrence and interactions of these pollutants in aquaculture environment. Combined pollutants, such as MPs and coexisting adsorbents, were widespread and could include antibiotics, heavy metals, resistance genes, and pathogens. Elevated levels of chemical pollutants on MPs could lead to the emergence of resistance genes under selective pressure, facilitated by bacterial communities and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). MPs acted as vectors, transferring pollutants into the food web. Various technologies, including membrane technology, coagulation, and advanced oxidation, have been trialed for pollutants removal, each with its benefits and drawbacks. Future research should focus on ecologically friendly treatment technologies for emerging contaminants in aquaculture wastewater. This review provided insights into understanding and addressing newly developing toxins, aiming to develop integrated systems for effective aquaculture wastewater treatment.","Xie S., Hamid N., Zhang T., Zhang Z., Peng L.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134324,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antimicrobial Efficacy Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Biofilm Formation In A Three-Dimensional Lung Epithelial Model And The Influence Of Fetal Bovine Serum,"In vitro models that mimic in vivo host-pathogen interactions are needed to evaluate candidate drugs that inhibit bacterial virulence traits. We established a new approach to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm susceptibility on biotic surfaces, using a three-dimensional (3-D) lung epithelial cell model. P. aeruginosa formed antibiotic resistant biofilms on 3-D cells without affecting cell viability. The biofilm-inhibitory activity of antibiotics and/or the anti-biofilm peptide DJK-5 were evaluated on 3-D cells compared to a plastic surface, in medium with and without fetal bovine serum (FBS). In both media, aminoglycosides were more efficacious in the 3-D cell model. In serum-free medium, most antibiotics (except polymyxins) showed enhanced efficacy when 3-D cells were present. In medium with FBS, colistin was less efficacious in the 3-D cell model. DJK-5 exerted potent inhibition of P. aeruginosa association with both substrates, only in serum-free medium. DJK-5 showed stronger inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa associated with plastic compared to 3-D cells. The combined addition of tobramycin and DJK-5 exhibited more potent ability to inhibit P. aeruginosa association with both substrates. In conclusion, lung epithelial cells influence the efficacy of most antimicrobials against P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, which in turn depends on the presence or absence of FBS.","Crabbé A., Liu Y., Matthijs N., Rigole P., De La Fuente-Nùñez C., Davis R., Ledesma M.A., Sarker S., Van Houdt R., Hancock R.E., Coenye T., Nickerson C.A.",10.1038/srep43321,Scientific Reports
A Review On Mechanistic Understanding Of Microplastic Pollution On The Performance Of Anaerobic Digestion,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) has emerged as a promising technology for diverting the organic waste from the landfills along with the production of clean energy. AD is a microbial-driven biochemical process wherein the plethora of microbial communities participate in converting the putrescible organic matter into biogas. Nevertheless, the AD process is susceptible to the external environmental factors such as presence of physical (microplastics) and chemical (antibiotics, pesticides) pollutants. The microplastics (MPs) pollution has received recent attention due to the increasing plastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. This review was aimed for holistic assessment of impact of MPs pollution on AD process to develop efficient treatment technology. First, the possible pathways of MPs entry into the AD systems were critically evaluated. Further, the recent literature on the experimental studies pertaining to the impact of different types of MPs at different concentrations on the AD process was reviewed. In addition, several mechanisms such as direct exposure of MPs on the microbial cells, indirect impact of MPs through the leaching of toxic chemicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation on AD process were elucidated. Besides, the risk possessed by the increase of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after the AD process due to the MPs stress on microbial communities were discussed. Overall, this review deciphered the severity of MPs pollution on AD process at different levels.","Manu M.K., Luo L., Kumar R., Johnravindar D., Li D., Varjani S., Zhao J., Wong J.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121426,Environmental Pollution

In this study, pristine degradable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and non-degradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs and their UV-aged counterparts were exposed to the Yuhangtang River (Y-River). The results showed that the surface morphology and structure of all MPs markedly changed after exposure. Oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrophilicity of aged MPs were higher compared with their pristine counterparts, and further increased after river exposure. The content of extracellular polymers (EPS) of biofilms on MPs increased with the exposure time, and was higher on aged MPs than on pristine ones. Similar results were obtained for most antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between pristine and aged MPs, and ARGs were positively related to pathogens. Dominant bacteria on all MPs were Proteobacteria (51.3 %–81.1 %), Chloroflexi (5.2 %–20.9 %) and Firmicutes (0.4 %–15.9 %), which markedly differed from the Y-River community. Aged MPs could enrich more microbes but relatively fewer bacterial species than pristine MPs, and higher enrichment and species diversity were observed on PLLA compared with PET. This study demonstrates that MPs are highly effective carriers for microbes, and the results provide valuable insights for evaluating the potential impact of bio-MPs on aquatic ecological environment.","Zhao J., Wang H., Zheng L., Wang Q., Song Y.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.136014,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
The Microbiome And Antibiotic Resistome In Soil Under Biodegradable Composite Carbon Source Amendment,"The decomposition of biodegradable composite carbon sources generates a large amount of biodegradable microplastics, which may not only furnish microbial denitrification, but might also pose potential environmental risks. In the present study, the effects of different dosages of a biodegradable composite carbon source on the microbial communities, the nitrogen metabolic pathways and the antibiotic resistome were explored through Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis and metagenomic analysis. The results of partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) demonstrated that the response of the bacterial community to a biodegradable composite carbon source was more obvious than the fungal community. The application of biodegradable microplastics diminished the complexity of the microbial communities to some extent and obviously stimulated denitrification. Antibiotics resistance gene (ARG) dispersal was not evidently accelerated after the addition of biodegradable composite carbon source. Lysobacter, Methylobacillus, Phyllobacterium, Sinorhizobium, Sphingomonas from Proteobacteria and Actinomadura, Agromyces, Gaiella and Micromonospora from Actinobacteria were the major ARG hosts. Overall, the addition of a biodegradable composite carbon source shaped microbial communities and their antibiotic resistance profiles in this study.","Yang Z., Lou Y., Yan X., Pan H., Wang H., Yang Q., Sun Y., Zhuge Y.",10.3390/jox13030027,Journal Of Xenobiotics
Nano- And Microplastics Drive The Dynamic Equilibrium Of Amoeba-Associated Bacteria And Antibiotic Resistance Genes,"As emerging pollutants, microplastics have become pervasive on a global scale, inflicting significant harm upon ecosystems. However, the impact of these microplastics on the symbiotic relationship between protists and bacteria remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which nano- and microplastics of varying sizes and concentrations influence the amoeba-bacterial symbiotic system. The findings reveal that nano- and microplastics exert deleterious effects on the adaptability of the amoeba host, with the magnitude of these effects contingent upon particle size and concentration. Furthermore, nano- and microplastics disrupt the initial equilibrium in the symbiotic relationship between amoeba and bacteria, with nano-plastics demonstrating a reduced ability to colonize symbiotic bacteria within the amoeba host when compared to their microplastic counterparts. Moreover, nano- and microplastics enhance the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and heavy metal resistance genes in the bacteria residing within the amoeba host, which undoubtedly increases the potential transmission risk of both human pathogens and resistance genes within the environment. In sum, the results presented herein provide a novel perspective and theoretical foundation for the study of interactions between microplastics and microbial symbiotic systems, along with the establishment of risk assessment systems for ecological environments and human health.","Zhou M., Ma L., Wang Z., Li S., Cai Y., Li M., Zhang L., Wang C., Wu B., Yan Q., He Z., Shu L.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134958,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Distribution And Potential Ecological Risks Of Microplastics In Zhushan Bay, China","The interaction between microplastics (MPs) and microorganisms may alter the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water and increase the ecological risk of drinking water sources. To investigate the characteristics of MPs geographical distribution and its potential ecological risk in typical urban water, this study was conducted in Zhushan Bay, and we carried out a combination of tests to analyze the distribution of MPs and the migration changes of their surface microbial community composition and ARGs in different media by 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, non-targeted metabolomics and qPCR genomics in the near-shore (I), middle area (Ⅱ) and near-lake (III) of Zhushan Bay. The results showed that MPs in fibrous form were dominant in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay; Polyurethane (PU) and Silicone were the main MPs types in Zhushan Bay. The abundance of MPs in the water of Zhushan Bay was winter > summer > autumn > spring; and in the sediment was winter > summer > autumn > spring, respectively. The distribution results of MPs in geographical location are as follows: In the water I > Ⅱ > III, sediment exhibited Ⅱ > III > I. The results indicate that physicochemical factors will affect the geographical distribution of MPs and their surface microbial community composition in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay. More cooperative behaviors and increased metabolically important pathways occurred in the microbial network on water-MPs compared to sediment-MPs. However, the microbial community in the sediment-MPs was more stable and had higher abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). A total of 362 differential metabolites were detected, of which 193 were up-regulated and 19 down-regulated differential metabolites. blaTEM, Sul, and inti1 were prevalent in both the water and sediments of Zhushan Bay. Sul1 was most contaminated in ARGs. This study provides the latest field data and insights into MPs pollution in key aquatic environments.","Wang Z., Li Q., Huang H., Liu J., Wang J., Chen Y., Huang S., Luo X., Zheng Z.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139024,Chemosphere
Prevalence And Risk Assessment Of Microplastics In The Nile Delta Estuaries: “The Plastic Nile” Revisited,"Recent research is directed toward studying plastic pollution in rivers, and estuaries due to the importance of freshwater bodies in all aspects of life. The river deltas and estuaries are interesting for studying the flux of plastics into the oceans. The Nile River has been identified as a hot spot of plastic litter flux in the eastern Mediterranean basin. In addition, it was nicknamed “Plastic Nile”, yet this major river is largely unexplored with a lack of field measurements and adequate surveys. The current study was based on bridging this scientific gap. Three trips were conducted, covering 30 km in the Rosetta branch and 23 km in the Damietta branch, during the high water level in summer 2021, and 10 km off the inlet of Lake Burullus, in spring 2021. Microplastics in surface water ranged from 761 ± 319 to 1718 ± 1008 MPs/m(3), and from 167 ± 137 to 1630 ± 1303 MPs/kg of dry sediments. Land use/ land cover mapping using Sentinel-2 images showed several sources of pollution that contribute to plastic contamination in the study area. Thermal analysis indicated seven plastic polymers; including, PE, PP, PET, PEVA, and PTFE, using discarded plastic products as reference materials. Microplastics were composed of colored and glossy fragments of sizes <500 μm, originating from land-based sources. Pollution load, polymer risk assessment, and ecological risk indices were calculated. Based on field observations macro-plastics were retained within the extensive network of infrastructure and dam systems. 80–106 billion MPs/year were estimated to flux from the Nile estuaries into the Mediterranean Sea. The current situation urges the development of binding plans to reduce plastic waste in the Nile Delta, as well as setting environmental monitoring points along the Deltaic coast.","Shabaka S., Moawad M.N., Ibrahim M.I.A., El-Sayed A.A.M., Ghobashy M.M., Hamouda A.Z., El-Alfy M.A., Darwish D.H., Youssef N.A.E.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158446,Science Of The Total Environment
Modulations Of The Skin Microbiome In Skin Disorders: A Narrative Review From A Wound Care Perspective,"The cutaneous microbiome represents a highly dynamic community of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Scientific evidence, particularly from the last two decades, has revealed that these organisms are far from being inconsequential microscopic hitchhikers on the human body, nor are they all opportunistic pathogens waiting for the chance to penetrate the skin barrier and cause infection. In this review, we will describe how dermatological diseases have been found to be associated with disruptions and imbalances in the skin microbiome and how this new evidence had shaped the diagnosis and clinical practice relating to these disorders. We will identify the microbial agents which have been found to directly exacerbate skin diseases, as well as those which can ameliorate many of the symptoms associated with dermatological disorders. Furthermore, we will discuss the studies which suggest that bacteriotherapy, either by topical use of probiotics or by bacteria-derived compounds, can rectify skin microbial imbalances, thereby offering a promising alternative to antibiotic treatment and reducing the risks of antibiotic resistance.","Piazzesi A., Scanu M., Ciprandi G., Putignani L.",10.1111/iwj.70087,International Wound Journal
Management And Prevention Of Drug Resistant Infections In Burn Patients,"Introduction: Despite modern advances, the primary cause of death after burns remains infection and sepsis. A key factor in determining outcomes is colonization with multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms. Infections secondary to MDR organisms are challenging due to lack of adequate antibiotic treatment, subsequently prolonging hospital stay and increasing risk of adverse outcomes. Areas covered: This review highlights the most frequent organisms colonizing burn wounds as well as the most common MDR bacterial infections. Additionally, we discuss different treatment modalities and MDR infection prevention strategies as their appropriate management would minimize morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a search for articles on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and UpToDate with applied search strategies including a combination of: “burns, ‘thermal injury,’ ‘infections,’ ‘sepsis,’ ‘drug resistance,’ and ‘antimicrobials.’ Expert opinion: Management and prevention of MDR infections in burns is an ongoing challenge. We highlight the importance of preventative over therapeutic strategies, which are easy to implement and cost-effective. Additionally, targeted, limited use of antimicrobials can be beneficial in burn patients. A promising future area of investigation within this field is post-trauma microbiome profiling. Currently, the best treatment strategy for MDR in burn patients is prevention.","Vinaik R., Barayan D., Shahrokhi S., Jeschke M.G.",10.1080/14787210.2019.1648208,Expert Review Of Anti-Infective Therapy
Pathogens And Shift Of Resistance In Early Infections After Operative Fracture Fixation,"Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a challenge for the healthcare system. During the last 30 years, the literature has shown an increase of gram-negative bacterial strains in multiple infectious sites and that cephalosporins have replaced penicillin as the gold standard in peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study aims to examine the recent bacterial spectrum in orthopedic early SSIs and to compare it with a historical cohort. Patients and Methods: Patients in a level 1 trauma center with an SSI within six weeks after open fixation of a fracture were analyzed in two adjacent periods from 2007 to 2012 (data pool 1; DP1) and 2013 to 2017 (data pool 2; DP2), retrospectively. The detected microbiologic pathogens and the associated resistograms from both time periods were compared. Results: Six hundred eighty-one smear tests and respective pathogens from the wounds of 463 patients (mean age, 62.6 ± 20 years) with SSIs were analyzed. The following pathogens were found most frequent: Staphylococcus epidermidis (DP1, 20.6%; DP2, 26.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (DP1, 27.1%; DP2, 16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (DP1, 13.7%; DP2, 11.1%), Bacillus sp. (DP1, 3.0%; DP2, 5.3%), Escherichia coli (DP1, 5.1%; DP2, 4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (DP1, 3.7%; DP2, 2.5%). In DP2, there were lower primary early infection rates with Staphylococcus aureus than in DP1 (p = 0.002). In DP2, Staphylococcus epidermidis showed an oxacillin resistance in 90.6% and an increased resistance (79.8%; p = 0.069) to several classes of antibiotic agents compared to DP1. Conclusions: No bacterial shift toward gram-negative species was observed in this investigation. However, Staphylococcus epidermidis showed an increased antibiotic resistance in the more recent patient cohort. The incidence of SSIs with Staphylococcus aureus decreased substantially.","Oberhuber-Kurth L.M., Angeli R., Lippmann N., Notov D., Osterhoff G., Frank K., Langer S., Kohler L.",10.1089/sur.2022.033,Surgical Infections
Identification And Development Of An Age-Related Classification And Signature To Predict Prognosis And Immune Landscape In Osteosarcoma,"Background. In childhood and adolescence, the prevailing bone tumor is osteosarcoma associated with frequent recurrence and lung metastasis. This research focused on predicting the survival and immune landscape of osteosarcoma by developing a prognostic signature and establishing aging-related genes (ARGs) subtypes. Methods. The training group comprised of the transcriptomic and associated clinical data of 84 patients with osteosarcoma accessed at the TARGET database and the validation group consisted of 53 patients from GSE21257. The aging-related subtypes were identified using unsupervised consensus clustering analysis. The ARG signature was developed utilizing multivariate Cox analysis and LASSO regression. The prognostic value was assessed using the univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, Kaplan-Meier plotter, time-dependent ROC curve, and nomogram. The functional enrichment analyses were performed by GSEA, GO, and KEGG analysis, while the ssGSEA, ESTIMATE, and CIBERSORT analyses were conducted to reveal the immune landscape in osteosarcoma. Results. The two clusters of osteosarcoma patients formed based on 543 ARGs, depicted a considerable difference in the tumor microenvironment, and the overall survival and immune cell infiltration rate varied as well. Among these, the selected 23 ARGs were utilized for the construction of an efficient predictive prognostic signature for the overall survival prediction. The testing in the validation group of osteosarcoma patients confirmed the status of the high-risk score as an independent indicator for poor prognosis, which was already identified as such using the univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. Furthermore, the ARG signature could distinguish different immune-related functions, infiltration status of immune cells, and tumor microenvironment, as well as predict the immunotherapy response of osteosarcoma patients. Conclusion. The aging-related subtypes were identified and a prognostic signature was developed in this research, which determined different prognoses and allowed for treatment of osteosarcoma patients to be tailored. Additionally, the immunotherapeutic response of individuals with osteosarcoma could also be predicted by the ARG signature.","Hong J., Wang X., Yu L., Li J., Hu H., Mao W.",10.1155/2022/5040458,Journal Of Oncology
Tire Wear Particles Enhance Horizontal Gene Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Microplastics (MPs) have introduced new surfaces for biofilm development and gene exchange among bacteria. We investigated Tire Wear Particles (TWPs) for their involvement in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), particularly in relation to associated metals in the matrices of TWPs. We employed red-fluorescently tagged E. coli strain as a donor with green-fluorescently tagged, broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5, resistant to trimethoprim. As a recipient, we utilized Pseudomonas sp. and a natural lake microbial community. HGT activity on TWPs was determined and compared with that on polystyrene (PS) (with and without metals), and chitosan, which was used as a natural surface. Exposure to TWPs significantly enhanced HGT frequency of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) from donor to recipient compared to PS and chitosan, and metals of TWPs further promoted HGT. HGT frequency on TWPs with Pseudomonas sp. was found to be 10(−3) at 30 °C. in the lake community, it was similarly high already at 25 °C suggesting a higher permissiveness of the natural microbial community towards ARG at lower temperatures. This study sheds light on the potential impact of TWPs in promoting HGT, forming the basis for health risk assessments of TWPs and more generally of MP pollution in various aquatic ecosystems.","Jaffer Y.D., Abdolahpur Monikh F., Uli K., Grossart H.-P.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.120187,Environmental Research
"Climate Warming, Environmental Degradation And Pollution As Drivers Of Antibiotic Resistance","Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge to public health, but human-caused environmental changes have not been widely recognized as its drivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between environmental degradation and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that the former can potentially fuel the latter with significant public health outcomes. We describe that (i) global warming favors horizontal gene transfer, bacterial infections, the spread of drug-resistant pathogens due to water scarcity, and the release of resistance genes with wastewater; (ii) pesticide and metal pollution act as co-selectors of antibiotic resistance mechanisms; (iii) microplastics create conditions promoting and spreading antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria; (iv) changes in land use, deforestation, and environmental pollution reduce microbial diversity, a natural barrier to antibiotic resistance spread. We argue that management of antibiotic resistance must integrate environmental goals, including mitigation of further increases in the Earth's surface temperature, better qualitative and quantitative protection of water resources, strengthening of sewage infrastructure and improving wastewater treatment, counteracting the microbial diversity loss, reduction of pesticide and metal emissions, and plastic use, and improving waste recycling. These actions should be accompanied by restricting antibiotic use only to clinically justified situations, developing novel treatments, and promoting prophylaxis. It is pivotal for health authorities and the medical community to adopt the protection of environmental quality as a part of public health measures, also in the context of antibiotic resistance management.","Rzymski P., Gwenzi W., Poniedziałek B., Mangul S., Fal A.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123649,Environmental Pollution
Antimicrobial Face Shield: Next Generation Of Facial Protective Equipment Against Sars-Cov-2 And Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Transparent materials used for facial protection equipment provide protection against microbial infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. However, transparent materials used for this type of application are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. They just avoid direct contact between the person and the biological agent. Therefore, healthy people can become infected through contact of the contaminated material surfaces and this equipment constitute an increasing source of infectious biological waste. Furthermore, infected people can transmit microbial infections easily because the protective equipment do not inactivate the microbial load generated while breathing, sneezing or coughing. In this regard, the goal of this work consisted of fabricating a transparent face shield with intrinsic antimicrobial activity that could provide extra-protection against infectious agents and reduce the generation of infectious waste. Thus, a single-use transparent antimicrobial face shield composed of polyethylene terephthalate and an antimicrobial coating of benzalkonium chloride has been developed for the next generation of facial protective equipment. The antimicrobial coating was analyzed by atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy with elemental analysis. This is the first facial transparent protective material capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one minute of contact, and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial infections contribute to severe pneumonia associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing. Our extra protective broad-spectrum antimicrobial composite material could also be applied for the fabrication of other facial protective tools such as such as goggles, helmets, plastic masks and space separation screens used for counters or vehicles. This low-cost technology would be very useful to combat the current pandemic and protect health care workers from multidrug-resistant infections in developed and underdeveloped countries.","Tuñón-Molina A., Martí M., Muramoto Y., Noda T., Takayama K., Serrano-Aroca Á.",10.3390/ijms22179518,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
"Yokenella Regensburgei—Past, Present And Future","Yokenella regensburgei is a Gram-negative rod part of the Enterobacteriaceae family (order Enterobacterales) and a rare cause of human infections. Although improved diagnostic methods have led to an increase in reports of this elusive pathogen, information remains limited. In order to provide a better understanding of this bacterium, we developed the first comprehensive review of its biology, biochemical profile, antimicrobial resistance pattern, virulence factors, natural reservoir and involvement in various veterinary and human infections. Human infections with this bacterium are scarcely reported, most probably due to constraints regarding its identification and biochemical similarities to Hafnia alvei. Multiple systematic searches revealed 23 cases of human infection, with a seemingly worldwide distribution, mostly in middle-aged or elderly male patients, often associated with immunosuppression. To date, Y. regensburgei has been reported in skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and sepsis, osteoarticular infections and in others such as urinary tract and digestive infections. The unique ability of Y. regensburgei to degrade polystyrene presents a novel and promising avenue for addressing plastic pollution in the near future. However, large-scale applications of this bacterium will undoubtedly increase human exposure, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive research into its role in human and veterinary infections, pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance.","Toc D.A., Costache C., Neculicioiu V.S., Rusu I.-M., Roznovan B.-V., Botan A., Toc A.G., Șchiopu P., Panaitescu P.-S., Pană A.G., Colosi I.A.",10.3390/antibiotics13070589,Antibiotics
Analysis Of Pathogen Distribution And Antimicrobial Resistance At Infected Sites In Plastic Surgery,"Objective: By analyzing the distribution and drug resistance of common pathogen in different sites in plastic surgery to provide reference for clinicians to choose the best antibacterial treatment plan. Methods: Pathogens of postoperative infection in plastic surgery from January 2011 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed to determine the species and quantity, and to access the trend of each pathogen's detection rate. The antibiotic sensitivity and distribution characteristics of common pathogens were studied in conjunction with the site of infection. Results: A total of 1709 bacterial strains were detected, including 1244 gram-positive bacterial strains and 465 gram-negative bacterial strains. The main pathogen of perineum was Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the most common pathogen in the other infected sites. The detection rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (MRCNS) was on the rise from 2011 to 2021. No S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) strains were resistant to vancomycin. The sensitive rate of S. aureus from all parts and CoNS from all sites except lower limbs and mandible was higher than 80% to linezolid. The resistance rate of S. aureus and CoNS in all parts to penicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin was high. The susceptibility rate of CoNS in lower mandible was high to gentamicin. Conclusions: Staphylococcus aureus was the primary pathogen of gram-positive bacteria in all site of plastic surgery except perineum, followed by CoNS. The distribution and drug resistance of pathogen in different infection sites were different. We should formulate more accurate and reasonable antibacterial programs according to drug resistance results of various parts to reduce the emergence of resistant strains and effectively prevent and control infection.","Jiang F., Su X., Dai Y., Shen H., Hu J., Wu L., Wu Y., Zhan S.",10.1111/jocd.15600,Journal Of Cosmetic Dermatology
Patterns Of Antibiotic Prescription In Implant Dentistry And Antibiotic Resistance Awareness Among European Dentists: A Questionnaire-Based Study,"OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance is an alarming global public health concern, threatening the effective treatment of common infections. This phenomenon is driven by the improper prescription of antibiotics. This study aimed to elucidate the patterns of antibiotic prescription in implant dentistry among European dentists and their awareness of antibiotic resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online validated questionnaire was distributed via e-mail to 6431 recipients through the European Association for Osseointegration. It comprised of 17 structured questions investigating demographic variables, working environment, clinical experience, attitude towards antibiotic prescription in particular in relation to implant dentistry and COVID-19 pandemic, and awareness of antibiotic resistance. Data were collected from April to May 2023. RESULTS: 281 dentists from 33 European countries completed the survey. Almost 80% affirmed to routinely prescribe antibiotics as prophylaxis as well as after dental implant placement, especially in medically compromised patients or in cases of bone grafting. Amoxicillin, alone (61%) or in combination with clavulanic acid (56%), was the most common antibiotic of choice. Awareness of penicillin resistance among respondents was high. For peri-implantitis treatment, more than half reported the use of systemic antibiotics. The large majority (95%) did not prescribe more antibiotics since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. Less than 40% declared to follow national guidelines for antibiotic prescription. CONCLUSION: This survey revealed a high prescription rate of antibiotics in implant dentistry, despite the awareness about antibiotic resistance among the respondents. The development and adherence to European guidelines has been identified as a potential strategy for improving antimicrobial stewardship.","Becker K., Gurzawska-Comis K., Klinge B., Lund B., Brunello G.",10.1111/clr.14285,Clinical Oral Implants Research
Resistance-Proof Antimicrobial Drug Discovery To Combat Global Antimicrobial Resistance Threat,"Drug resistance is well-defined as a serious problem in our living world. To survive, microbes develop defense strategies against antimicrobial drugs. Drugs exhibit less or no effective results against microbes after the emergence of resistance because they are unable to cross the microbial membrane, in order to alter enzymatic systems, and/or upregulate efflux pumps, etc. Drug resistance issues can be addressed effectively if a “Resistance-Proof” or “Resistance-Resistant” antimicrobial agent is developed. This article discusses first the need for resistance-proof drugs, the imminent properties of resistance-proof drugs, current and future research progress in the discovery of resistance-proof antimicrobials, the inherent challenges, and opportunities. A molecule having imminent resistance-proof properties could target microbes efficiently, increase potency, and rule out the possibility of early resistance. This review triggers the scientific community to think about how an upsurge in drug resistance can be averted and emphasizes the discussion on the development of next-generation antimicrobials that will provide a novel effective solution to combat the global problem of drug resistance. Hence, resistance-proof drug development is not just a requirement but rather a compulsion in the drug discovery field so that resistance can be battled effectively. We discuss several properties of resistance-proof drugs which could initiate new ways of thinking about next-generation antimicrobials to resolve the drug resistance problem. This article sheds light on the issues of drug resistance and discusses solutions in terms of the resistance-proof properties of a molecule. In summary, the article is a foundation to break new ground in the development of resistance-proof therapeutics in the field of infection biology.","Upadhayay A., Ling J., Pal D., Xie Y., Ping F.-F., Kumar A.",10.1016/j.drup.2022.100890,Drug Resistance Updates
Pandrug-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Isolated From Ukrainian War Victims Are Hypervirulent,"Objectives: Carbapenem- and colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from war victims treated in hospitals in Ukraine. The question was whether these pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae are pathogenic and capable of causing disease in a broader context. Methods: Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates (n = 37) were tested for antibiotic resistance and subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In addition, their pathogenicity was tested by serum resistance and two separate animal models. Results: Isolates belonging to the sequence types (ST) 23, 147, 307, 395, and 512 were found to harbor resistance genes against carbapenems and cephalosporins. Nine isolates carried point mutations in pmrB and phoP genes associated with colistin resistance. All bacteria were equipped with multiple virulence genes, and the colistin-resistant isolates each carried 10 different genes. Colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae were more serum-resistant, more virulent against G. mellonella larvae, and displayed an increased survival in mice compared to colistin-susceptible bacteria. The iucA, peg-344, rmpA, rmpC, and rmpD genes were associated with increased virulence in animals. Conclusions: Pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae in Ukraine are hypervirulent and retain their pathogenicity, highlighting the need to prevent disseminated spread.","Ljungquist O., Magda M., Giske C.G., Tellapragada C., Nazarchuk O., Dmytriiev D., Thofte O., Öhnström V., Matuschek E., Blom A.M., Riesbeck K.",10.1016/j.jinf.2024.106312,Journal Of Infection
Distribution Patterns And Antibiotic Resistance Profiles Of Bacterial Pathogens Among Patients With Wound Infections In The Jiaxing Region From 2021 To 2023,"Purpose: To systematically assess the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens in wound infections, and analyze risk factors associated with multidrug resistance (MDR). Patients and Methods: Retrospectively analyzing Jiaxing-region medical records between January 2021 and December 2023, we identified a cohort of 461 wound infection patients. Cultures were grown on various agars, with bacteria identified via Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms were conducted by VITEK 2 system, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and Epsilometer test. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for statistical analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to pinpoint risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections and predict occurrences. Results: From 461 patients, 549 bacterial pathogens were isolated, predominantly consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline maintained their efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated sensitivity to aminoglycosides. Conversely, Escherichia coli exhibited high amoxicillin resistance (85.4%). More than half of the isolates were resistant to levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, and gentamicin, with Acinetobacter baumannii strains showing considerable resistance (65.8–68.4%) to advanced cephalosporins and carbapenems. Within this group, 58 MDROs were detected, primarily originating from Burn Plastic Surgery, Emergency, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) departments. Multivariate logistic regression identified hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgery, extended hospitalization, and exposure to multiple antibiotic classes as independent risk factors for MDRO wound infections. Based on these findings, a predictive model for MDRO occurrence in wounds was constructed, which had a sensitivity of 0.627, specificity of 0.933, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.838. Conclusion: Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in wound infections with differential antibiotic resistance. Independent risk factors included hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgery, extended hospitalization, and polyantibiotic use. We urge prioritizing culture, susceptibility tests, and personalized antibiotic strategies to address MDRO risks and improve wound infection management specificity and efficacy.","Wang C., Niu X., Bao S., Shen W., Jiang C.",10.2147/IDR.S470401,Infection And Drug Resistance
Sunlight-Driven Wearable And Robust Antibacterial Coatings With Water-Soluble Cellulose-Based Photosensitizers,"Herein, a simple, effective, and general strategy is demonstrated to obtain a water-soluble and nontoxic cellulose-based photosensitizer (CPS) with enhanced photodynamic antibacterial activity through introducing protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) groups onto the cellulose backbone. The synergistic effect of the anchoring and diluting effect of the cellulose backbone and the electrostatic repulsion between QAS groups effectively inhibit the π–π stacking of PpIX groups, thus the as-prepared CPS exhibits markedly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield. Meanwhile, the positively charged QAS groups endow the CPS with water-solubility and a strong attractive force to bacteria. As a result, the CPS can rapidly and efficiently kill drug-resistant bacteria strains, including E. coli and S. aureus, with a low light dose (2.4 J cm(−2)) and low concentration of PpIX groups (0.35 × 10(−6)m). Benefiting from the excellent processability and formability, the CPS is readily applied as a sunlight-driven wearable and robust antibacterial coating by a spray coating and later crosslinking procedure.","Jia R., Tian W., Bai H., Zhang J., Wang S., Zhang J.",10.1002/adhm.201801591,Advanced Healthcare Materials

Differentially expressed (DE) ARGs were downloaded from the intersection of SKCM data in GEPIA2 database and ARGs in Human Autophagy Database (HADB) database, and were verified in SKCM datasets GSE46517 and GSE15605. DE ARGs were enriched by Metascape online tools. According to GEPIA2 database, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10) was identified as a closely related factor and prognostic marker of SKCM. Then the correlation analysis of clinicopathological characteristics between TNFSF10 and SKCM was completed by several online tools such as TISCH, HPA, BEST and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we investigated TNFSF10 related functions and signal pathways with LinkedOmics online tool, and immune infiltration using Assistant for Clinical Bioinformatics online tool. Furthermore, correlation analysis between TNFSF10 expression and immunotherapy response was performed by TIDE algorithm and BEST online tool. And Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used to assessing the prognosis of SKCM patients receiving immunotherapy. Finally, the correlation analysis among TNFSF10 methylation, TNFSF10 expression and patient prognosis was completed by the DiseaseMeth version 2.0, UCSC XENA and qRT-PCR. ARGs are DE in SKCM and participate in the ERBB signaling pathway, as well as the processing and presentation of antigens. Moreover, TNFSF10's expression along with methylation expression were significantly associated with the prognosis. Low expression of TNFSF10 was associated with malignant clinicopathological features, lower immune signal activity and lower immunocytes abundance in patients with SKCM. As an ARG, TNFSF10 has a potential capacity in predicting the prognosis of SKCM patients, meanwhile, may be a novel immunotherapy marker for SKCM.","Xue L., Zhang W., Ju Y., Xu X., Bo H., Zhong X., Hu Z., Zheng C., Fang B., Tang S.",10.7150/jca.86735,Journal Of Cancer
Microbiological Findings In Burn Patients Treated In A General Versus A Designated Intensive Care Unit: Effect On Length Of Stay,"Background Infection is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in burn patients. The incidence and frequency of microbiological micro-organisms are known to vary across different models of intensive care units. To date, no study has attempted to describe the different findings in burn patients treated in an open, general intensive care unit (GICU) versus a dedicated burns intensive care unit (BICU). Only limited data is available on the effect of these microbiological micro-organisms on patients’ length of stay. Aim To characterize and compare the microbiological flora and antibiotic resistance patterns encountered in two different models of burn intensive care and to determine the effect of specific microbiological types on length of intensive care unit (ICU) and overall stay. Methods A retrospective case-control study of 209 burn patients treated in two highly specialized, Western burn referral centres between September 2009 and March 2014. Results 9710 culture results were analysed, of which 2590 (26.7%) yielded positive results (1537 in the GICU and 1050 in the BICU). Gram-positive cultures were more frequently found in the GICU, whereas Gram-negative and yeast cultures were more prevalent in the BICU. The most frequently encountered micro-organisms in both units were similar and included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Candida albicans. Significantly more resistant bacteria were detected in the BICU. Testing positive across all types of microbiological isolates, as well as for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria significantly prolonged patient length of stay. This effect was even more pronounced if the micro-organisms were resistant to antimicrobial therapy. Conclusion There are notable differences in the microbiological isolate and antibiotic resistance patterns between burn patients treated in a GICU compared to a designated BICU. In both units, testing positive for resistant microbiological micro-organisms is significantly associated with longer hospital stay.","Issler-Fisher A.C., Fakin R.M., Fisher O.M., Mckew G., Gazzola R., Rauch A.-K., Gottlieb T., Haertsch P., Guggenheim M., Giovanoli P., Maitz P.K.M.",10.1016/j.burns.2016.06.019,Burns
The Evolution Of Bacterial Pathogens In The Anthropocene,"Humankind has become a primary driver of global environmental and climate change. The extent of planetary change is such that it has been proposed to classify the current geological age as the ‘Anthropocene’. Anthropogenic environmental degradation presents numerous threats to human health and wellbeing, including an increased risk of infectious disease. This review focuses on how processes such as pollution, climate change and human-mediated dispersal could affect the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Effects of environmental change on the ‘big five’ of evolution: mutation rate, recombination (horizontal gene transfer), migration, selection and drift are discussed. Microplastic pollution is used as a case study to highlight the combined effects of some of these processes on the evolutionary diversification of human pathogens. Although the evidence is still incomplete, a picture is emerging that environmental pathogens could evolve at increased rates in the Anthropocene, with potential consequences for human infection.",Vos M.,10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104611,"Infection, Genetics And Evolution"
"Identification Of The Ageing-Related Prognostic Gene Signature, And The Associated Regulation Axis In Skin Cutaneous Melanoma","Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) has substantial malignancy and a poor prognosis. The function of ageing-related genes (ARGs) in SKCM is unknown. In this study, a prognostic risk-scoring model for ARG was constructed based on SKCM RNA-seq, mutation, and clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our novel prognostic model, which included four ARGs (IRS2, PDGFRA, TFAP2A, and SOD2), could distinguish between low-risk and high-risk groups. Low-risk patients benefited more from immunotherapy and commonly used targeted and chemotherapy drugs than high-risk patients. There were also considerable differences in immunocyte infiltration and tumour microenvironment between the two groups. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age, pT_stage, pM_stage, body mass index, tumour mutation burden, and risk score were independent factors influencing the prognosis of patients with SKCM; therefore, we devised a prognosis nomogram. Last, a long non-coding (lncRNA) NEAT1/miR-33a-5p/IRS2 regulatory axis of the competing endogenous RNA network was built to investigate the mechanisms of SKCM metastasis progression. Grouping based on the scoring system could predict the prognosis of SKCM and predict the sensitivity of patients to immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy. This could facilitate the formulation of individualised treatment strategies and help drug research and development. These findings highlight the regulatory axis of the lncRNA NEAT1/miR-33a-5p/IRS2, which may play a role in SKCM metastasis.","Tian C., Liu S., Huo R.",10.1038/s41598-022-22259-0,Scientific Reports
Application Of Phagotherapy In The Treatment Of Burn Patients (Review),"Treatment of patients with a burn injury is a complex process involving multicomponent multidirectional intensive therapy of the majority of organs and systems damaged by thermal effects on the skin, alternating with repeated surgical interventions aimed at removing nonviable tissues with subsequent plastic closure of wound defects. After the recovery from the burn shock, local infectious complications are considered to be the leading problem that decelerates the process of recovery and is the main cause of lethal outcomes. Since the skin integrity is broken, microorganisms penetrate readily into the internal environment of the human organism resulting in a septic state with multiple organ failure. A widespread and often uncontrollable use of antibacterial drugs in medical practice has led to the emergence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) in microorganisms. Introduction of drugs made on the basis of bacteriophages into practice is presently becoming increasingly important. This is confirmed by the growing interest in this field of pharmacology, the development of special programs aimed at studying the processes of phage and bacterial cell interaction. This review presents the main types of bacteria pertaining to MDR pathogens, principles of their classification, and the risk factors for infecting patients. The mechanisms of the selective action of phage particles on a bacterial cell and the possibility of using phage therapy in the treatment of burn injury (experimental and clinical data) based on the analysis of foreign literature are demonstrated as well as new positive properties of phages related to the changes in the macroorganism immune status caused by the interaction with bacteriophage particles.","Leontyev А.E., Pavlenko I.V., Kovalishena О.V., Saperkin N.V., Tulupov А.А., Beschastnov V.V.",10.17691/stm2020.12.3.12,Sovremennye Tehnologii V Medicine
How Anammox Responds To The Emerging Contaminants: Status And Mechanisms,"Numerous researches have been carried out to study the effects of emerging contaminants in wastewater, such as antibiotics, nanomaterials, heavy metals, and microplastics, on the anammox process. However, they are fragmented and difficult to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effects on reactor performance and the metabolic mechanisms in anammox bacteria. Therefore, this paper overviews the effects on anammox processes by the introduced emerging contaminants in the past years to fulfill such knowledge gaps that affect our perception of the inhibitory mechanisms and limit the optimization of the anammox process. In detail, their effects on anammox processes from the aspects of reactor performance, microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and functional genes related to anammox and nitrogen transformation in anammox consortia are summarized. Furthermore, the metabolic mechanisms causing the cell death of anammox bacteria, such as induction of reactive oxygen species, limitation of substrates diffusion, and membrane binding are proposed. By offering this review, the remaining research gaps are identified, and the potential metabolic mechanisms in anammox consortia are highlighted.","Wang Y., Ji X.-M., Jin R.-C.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112906,Journal Of Environmental Management
Bpa And Its Analogues (Bps And Bpf) Modify The Expression Of Genes Involved In The Endocrine Pathway And Apoptosis And A Multi Drug Resistance Gene Of The Aquatic Midge Chironomus Riparius (Diptera),"Many countries are limiting the use of bisphenol A (BPA) because evidence shows it is dangerous to human health and wildlife. For the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are proposed as safer alternatives. They have already been released into the aquatic environment without previously available information about their potential adverse effects. In this study, we compared the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF exposure to the expression profile of genes involved in the endocrine pathway (EcR and E74), ecdysone metabolism (Cyp18a1 and Shadow), apoptosis (DRONC) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 gene (MRP1) in the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera). The three toxicants increased Shadow expression, which is involved in ecdysone synthesis, but only BPF significantly altered Cyp18a1, which is implicated in ecdysone degradation. BPS and BPF modified EcR and E74 expression; BPF upregulated the effector caspase DRONC. Furthermore, BPA significantly increased MRP1 expression. This study provides insights into the action of bisphenols at the molecular level and highlights the potential risks of BPS and BPF as BPA alternatives.","Morales M., De La Fuente M., Martín-Folgar R.",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114806,Environmental Pollution
"Evaluation Of The Antimicrobial Activity Of Novel Composite Plastics Containing Two Silver (I) Additives, Acyl Pyrazolonate And Acyl Pyrazolone","Background: Public health systems today face the dual challenges of controlling infections and curbing the increase in antimicrobial resistance manifested in drug-resistant microorganisms in hospitals and elsewhere. In the last ten years, research has been conducted to develop new materials with antimicrobial properties to be used in medical devices, increasingly found to harbour critical nosocomial infections. Methods: Two next-generation composites using the antimicrobial qualities of silver were tested against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans with the purpose of evaluating their antimicrobial and antifungal activity. These tests applied the standardized method according to ISO-2216: Plastics-Measurement of Antibacterial Activity on Plastics Surfaces. Testing was carried out using polyethylene (PE) enriched with AgNO3 as a positive control and PE as a negative control. Results: The antimicrobial activity of the composites proved to be between medium (bacteriostatic) and very good (bactericidal). In particular, PE2 showed the highest scores against all microorganisms, with values ranging from good to very good. Instead, PE1 had lower scores, with a value of medium for Escherichia coli and slight for Candida albicans. Statistical analysis carried out with the t-test for unpaired data showed a statistically significant difference between the positive control and the other polymers (p- 0001). Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that the test, conducted to ISO-2216 standards, could be extended to include fungal strains and that the new composites could be used to produce antimicrobial surfaces for medical devices, for example, intubation tubes, urinary catheters, vascular prostheses, and mechanical heart valves. This would reduce the risk of microbial contamination and biofilm formation, ensuring better health outcomes for patients treated with these devices. Further testing should be done to evaluate potential future applications of these composites and the possibility of adding fungal strains to the IS0-2216 standard.","Scuri S., Petrelli F., Grappasonni I., Idemudia L., Marchetti F., Di Nicola C.",10.23750/abm.v90i3.8561,Acta Biomedica
Fate And Transport Of Biological Microcontaminants Bound To Microplastics In The Soil Environment,"Microplastics, fragmented plastic particles with a maximum dimension <5 mm, are an emerging contaminant of concern that can also serve as a vector of other chemical and biological contaminants. Compared to chemical contaminants, the potential of microplastics to adsorb biological microcontaminants such as antibiotic resistance genes, small interference RNAs, and pathogenic viruses is not well understood. Many current microplastic studies are based in the aquatic environment (freshwater, seawater, and wastewater), even though the terrestrial environment is considered both an important sink and source of microplastics. Microplastics co-occur with biological microcontaminants in many terrestrial environments including agricultural soils, where biosolids containing both contaminants are often applied as a soil amendment. Recent research suggests that microplastics in these environments can increase gene persistence and flow, which could have unintended downstream consequences for environmental microbiome health and resilience. Antibiotic resistance genes and silencing RNAs bound to microplastics, for example, have the potential to increase resistance and alter gene expression in environmental bacteria, respectively. This review evaluates the sources and pathways of microplastics and biological microcontaminants in the terrestrial environment as well as potential sorption mechanisms that can encourage long-range transport and persistence. Novel sources of biological microcontaminants are considered, and the role of microplastics in promoting the persistence and flow of biological microcontaminants evaluated. Finally, future research directions are suggested to increase understanding of the mechanisms that drive the fate and transport of microplastic–biological microcontaminant complexes in the terrestrial environment and better inform risk management.","Maguire L.W., Gardner C.M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164439,Science Of The Total Environment
"Microplastics In Landfill And Leachate: Occurrence, Environmental Behavior And Removal Strategies","Plastic wastes buried in landfill are gradually broken and decomposed into microplastics under physical, chemical and biological effects, bringing environmental risks to the exploitation of waste resources. Landfill leachate as a potential source of environmental microplastics has not good attention. Microplastics in leachate carry toxic and harmful pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes, and these vectors pose greater risks to human and environmental health without systematic treatment. Recently, the main technologies of landfill leachate treatment process include order batch activated sludge process, membrane biological reaction process, flocculation process, combined filtration process, and constructed wetland process. However, there is still little knowledge about microplastic removal of the existing leachate treatment facilities, and some technologies to alleviate the sources of such microplastics should be timely developed. This paper systematically summarizes the occurrence of plastics, microplastics and nanoplastics in leachate and their interactive pollution with other toxic pollutants. Meanwhile, the prospects of their environmental behaviors in landfill and leachate are put forward. The microplastic removal by existing leachate treatment equipment and the limitations and challenges to upgrading process of development and implementation are also discussed. The paper can provide a scientific basis for studying the fate of microplastics in landfill and leachate.","Shen M., Xiong W., Song B., Zhou C., Almatrafi E., Zeng G., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135325,Chemosphere
Phage-Plasmids Spread Antibiotic Resistance Genes Through Infection And Lysogenic Conversion,"Antibiotic resistance is rapidly spreading via the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in mobile genetic elements. While plasmids are key drivers of this process, few integrative phages encode antibiotic resistance genes. Here, we find that phage-plasmids, elements that are both phages and plasmids, often carry antibiotic resistance genes. We found 60 phage-plasmids with 184 antibiotic resistance genes, providing resistance for broad-spectrum-cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin. These genes are in a few hot spots, seem to have been cotranslocated with transposable elements, and are often in class I integrons, which had not been previously found in phages. We tried to induce six phage-plasmids with resistance genes (including four with resistance integrons) and succeeded in five cases. Other phage-plasmids and integrative prophages were coinduced in these experiments. As a proof of concept, we focused on a P1-like element encoding an extended spectrum b-lactamase, bla(CTX-M-55). After induction, we confirmed that it is capable of infecting and converting four other E. coli strains. Its reinduction led to the further conversion of a sensitive strain, confirming that it is a fully functional phage. This study shows that phage-plasmids carry a large diversity of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes that they can transfer across bacteria. As plasmids, these elements seem plastic and capable of acquiring genes from other plasmids. As phages, they may provide novel paths of transfer for resistance genes because they can infect bacteria that are distant in time and space from the original host. As a matter of alarm, they may also mediate transfer to other types of phages.","Pfeifer E., Bonnin R.A., Rocha E.P.C.",10.1128/mbio.01851-22,Mbio
"Multidrug-Resistant Pattern Of Food Borne Illness Associated Bacteria Isolated From Cockroaches In Meal Serving Facilities, Jimma, Ethiopia","Introduction: An increase in the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in recent years is becoming worrisome. Domestic cockroaches can play a significant role in the dissemination of such bacteria between the environment and human beings. This study aimed at determining anti-microbial resistance pattern of food borne illness associated bacteria identified from cockroaches trapped in restaurants and cafeterias. Methods: Trapped cockroaches were picked with surgical gloves, sealed in sterile plastic bags and transported to the Microbiology laboratory. Standard microbiological techniques were used to isolate and identify bacteria. Anti-microbial susceptibility testing was done using Kirby Bauer diffusion technique. Result: A total of five species of food borne illness associated bacteria were detected. Majority (57.1%) of the bacteria were isolated from the gut of cockroaches. More than 89% of the isolates were multi drug resistance (MDR). MDR was higher on gram positive bacteria. S. aureus showed 53.3% resistance against oxacillin(MRSA) and 33.3% against vancomycin. Conclusion: A very high percentage of MDR bacteria was seen in this study. Most of the bacteria tested were isolated from the gut of cockroaches. Potential factors associated with cockroaches that contributed to this high MDR rate of the isolates should be investigated in future.","Solomon F., Kibru G., Ali S.",10.4314/ahs.v18i1.6,African Health Sciences
Phthalates Boost Natural Transformation Of Extracellular Antibiotic Resistance Genes Through Enhancing Bacterial Motility And Dna Environmental Persistence,"The environmental dissemination of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) in wastewater and natural water bodies has aroused growing ecological concerns. The coexisting chemical pollutants in water are known to markedly affect the eARGs transfer behaviors of the environmental microbial community, but the detailed interactions and specific impacts remain elusive so far. Here, we revealed a concentration-dependent impact of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and several other types of phthalate esters (common water pollutants released from plastics) on the natural transformation of eARGs. The DMP exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (10 μg/L) resulted in a 4.8-times raised transformation frequency of Acinetobacter baylyi but severely suppressed the transformation at a high concentration (1000 μg/L). The promotion by low-concentration DMP was attributed to multiple mechanisms, including increased bacterial mobility and membrane permeability to facilitate eARGs uptake and improved resistance of the DMP-bounded eARGs (via noncovalent interaction) to enzymatic degradation (with suppressed DNase activity). Similar promoting effects of DMP on the eARGs transformation were also found in real wastewater and biofilm systems. In contrast, higher-concentration DMP suppressed the eARGs transformation by disrupting the DNA structure. Our findings highlight a potentially underestimated eARGs spreading in aquatic environments due to the impacts of coexisting chemical pollutants and deepen our understanding of the risks of biological-chemical combined pollution in wastewater and environmental water bodies.","Wu J., Lv Y.-H., Sun D., Zhou J.-H., Wu J., He R.-L., Liu D.-F., Song H., Li W.-W.",10.1021/acs.est.4c02751,Environmental Science And Technology
Screening Of Autophagy-Related Prognostic Genes In Metastatic Skin Melanoma,"Cutaneous melanoma refers to a common skin tumor that is dangerous to health with a great risk of metastasis. Previous researches reported that autophagy is associated with the progression of cutaneous melanoma. Nevertheless, the role played by genes with a relation to autophagy (ARG) in the prediction of the course of metastatic cutaneous melanoma is still largely unknown. We observed that thirteen ARGs showed relations to overall survival (OS) in the Cox regression investigation based on a single variate. We developed 2-gene signature, which stratified metastatic cutaneous melanoma cases to groups at great and small risks. Cases suffering from metastatic cutaneous melanoma in the group at great risks had power OS compared with cases at small risks. The risk score, T phase, N phase, and age were proved to be individual factors in terms of the prediction of OS. Besides, the risk scores identified by the two ARGs were significantly correlated with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated accurate predicting performance exhibited by the 2-gene signature. We also found that the immunization and stromal scores achieved by the group based on large risks were higher compared with those achieved by the group based on small risks. The metastatic cutaneous melanoma cases achieving the score based on small risks acquired greater expression of immune checkpoint molecules as compared with the high-risk group. In conclusion, the 2-ARG gene signature indicated a novel prognostic indicator for prognosis prediction of metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which served as an important tool for guiding the clinical treatment of cutaneous melanoma.","Chen C.-J., Kajita H., Aramaki-Hattori N., Sakai S., Kishi K.",10.1155/2022/8556593,Disease Markers
Cutaneous Serratia Marcescens Infections In Korea: A Retrospective Analysis Of 13 Patients,"Serratia marcescens is a Gram-negative bacillus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Because of increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance, this bacterium has received considerable attention and has emerged as an important pathogen. In order to reveal clinical and microbiological characteristics of S. marcescens cutaneous infection and to suggest appropriate antibiotic treatment, we retrospectively analyzed 17 strains isolated from wound swabs of Korean patients between November 2005 and March 2014. A total of 13 patients (five men and eight women) were included in our study, with a mean age of 46.3 years (range, 21-82). Based on medical history, seven patients were classified as immunocompromised. Prior predisposing factors for infections were noted in 12 patients, including pre-existing leg ulcers or dermatitis (5/13), preceding cancer surgeries (2/13), plastic surgeries and filler injection (2/13), traumas (2/13) and medical procedures following cutaneous abscess (1/13). Cutaneous infections showed various clinical presentations, including spontaneous dermal abscess, fingernail change, painful nodules and papular erosions. We found that third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, levofloxacin and meropenem appeared active against all 17 strains in vitro. Clinically, all patients treated with empirical first-generation cephalosporin showed treatment resistance, and oral quinolone monotherapy was the most preferred antibiotic regimen without treatment failure, with an average treatment duration of 25 days (range, 14-42). This study demonstrates the various clinical presentations and treatment responses for cutaneous S. marcescens infection. Moreover, we suggest that initial antibiotic coverage should be broad enough to account for multidrug resistance in this rare pathogen.","Seo J., Shin D., Oh S.H., Lee J.H., Chung K.Y., Lee M.-G., Kim D.S.",10.1111/1346-8138.13059,Journal Of Dermatology
Determination Of The Relationship Between Expression And Functional Activity Of Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 1 Using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy,"Cancer cells can develop multidrug resistance (MDR) after prolonged exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, which is a severe impediment to successful treatment. MDR is typically associated with transmembrane proteins mediating efflux of administered drugs, thereby keeping their intracellular concentration below the threshold required to kill cells. Although expression assays based on flow cytometry and immunostaining have shown that multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) is prevalent in many cancer types, the functional activity of this efflux pump is more difficult to elucidate, especially at the single-cell level. Herein, we report the measurement of MRP1 functional activity in individual cancer cells using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Cells were cultured onto plastic substrates containing selective adhesion sites. Optical microscopy and SECM revealed that cells adapt to the underlying surface, while MRP1 functional activity increases once the dimensions of the adhesive islands become smaller than those of the cell itself. Time-lapse SECM imaging revealed a suitable window of 30 min to complete each measurement before the cell undergoes blebbing, which is associated with a considerable increase in functional activity. Distinct cell populations were produced by performing a doxorubicin drug challenge on two parental cell lines (e.g., wild-type HeLa cells and MRP1-overexpressing HeLa-R cells). Expression and functional activity of MRP1 were determined using flow cytometry and SECM, and our findings show that these parameters do not directly correlate. This suggests that functional activity may represent a powerful indicator of a cancer cell's response to chemotherapeutic treatment and should improve our understanding of efflux mechanisms based on MRP1.","Polcari D., Hernández-Castro J.A., Li K., Geissler M., Mauzeroll J.",10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01601,Analytical Chemistry
Distinct Bacterial Communities And Resistance Genes Enriched By Triclocarban-Contaminated Polyethylene Microplastics In Antibiotics And Heavy Metals Polluted Sewage Environment,"Knowledge gaps still surround the question of what biofilms form on contaminated microplastics (MPs) in the antibiotics and (or) heavy metals polluted sewage. In this work, the clean polyethylene microplastics (PE MPs) and triclocarban (TCC)-contaminated PE MPs were cultured in the sewage containing only ampicillin (AMP), only copper (Cu) and both AMP and Cu for 28 days. The results showed that the TCC on PE MPs (with concentration of 2.48 mg/g PE MPs) did not impede the adhesion of the bacteria and the formation of biofilm. Moreover, many potential pathogenic bacteria (Aquabacterium and Pseudoxanthomonas) and potential resistant bacteria (Stenotrophomonas) were more likely to attach on TCC-contaminated PE MPs compared with clean PE MPs. In addition, biofilms of TCC-contaminated PE MPs had highest potential pathogenic functions. TCC-contaminated PE MPs also caused the increases of various resistance genes in both biofilm and sewage. The co-occurrence of TCC, AMP and Cu might exert a stronger selective pressure on bacterial communities and promote the co-selection of resistance genes. In addition, TCC-contaminated PE MPs resulted in higher abundance of five mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (intI1, intI3, tnpA-04, IS613 and trb-C) in sewage, which might further promote the transmission of resistance genes.","Zhao Y., Gao J., Wang Z., Cui Y., Zhang Y., Dai H., Li D.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156330,Science Of The Total Environment
Overview Of Host Defense Peptides And Their Applications For Plastic And Reconstructive Surgeons,"BACKGROUND: Host defense peptides are a family of endogenous short peptides that are found in all living beings and play a critical role in innate immunity against infection. METHODS: A nonsystematic review of host defense peptides was conducted with specific interest in properties and applications relevant to plastic and reconstructive surgery. RESULTS: In addition to their direct antimicrobial actions against pathogens, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, they also demonstrate important functions in immunomodulation, tumor cell lysis, and tissue regeneration. These properties have made them a topic of clinical interest for plastic surgeons because of their potential applications as novel antibiotics, wound healing medications, and cancer therapies. The rising clinical interest has led to a robust body of literature describing host defense peptides in great depth and breadth. Numerous mechanisms have been observed to explain their diverse functions, which rely on specific structural characteristics. However, these peptides remain mostly experimental, with limited translation to clinical practice because of numerous failures to achieve acceptable results in human trials. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the broad ranging potential of these peptides for use in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, they are rarely discussed in the literature or at scientific meetings. In this review, the authors provide a summary of the background, structure, function, bacterial resistance, and clinical applications of host defense peptides with the goal of stimulating host defense peptide-based innovation within the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery.","Delong M.R., Tandon V.J., Da Lio A.L., Deming T.J., Cederna P.S.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000006910,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Preliminary Study On Resistance Mechanism And Virulence Features In Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae From Burn Patients,"Objective: To investigate resistance mechanism and virulence features of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and to provide theoretical foundation for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections in burn wards as well as clinical therapy of CRKP. Methods: Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples of burn patients hospitalized in our unit from February to December 2016 were collected. The diameters of inhibition zone of imipemen or meropenem susceptibility disk of the above strains were≤22 mm. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and automated instrument were applied to test drug resistance of the strains to 17 antibiotics of cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, quinolones, and carbapenems. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze homology of the strains. Crystal violet staining was applied to assess ability of biofilm formation of the strains. The hypermucoviscosity (HM) phenotype of the strains was determined by string test. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect common carbapenemase genes of bla(KPC), bla(IMP), bla(OXA-48), and bla(NDM), capsular serotype genes of K1, K2, and K57, and virulence-associated gene of rmpA. Results: (1) A total of 29 CRKP strains were isolated. The 29 CRKP strains were with high drug resistance rate to carbapenems antibiotics of imipenen, meropenem, and ertapenem, and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones antibiotics, while the strains were with low drug resistance rate to sulfonamides antibiotics and tegafycline. (2) The 29 CRKP strains had 4 types of A, B, C, and D according to PFGE, with 11 strains of type A, 10 strains of type B, 6 strains of type C, and 2 strains of type D. (3) Among the 29 CRKP strains, 25 strains were positive in biofilm formation, with positive rate of 86.2%. (4) None of the 29 CRKP strains was positive in the string test with HM phenotype. (5) All the 29 CRKP strains carried carbapenemase genes. Among the 29 CRKP strains, 11 strains carried both bla(NDM-1) and bla(OXA-48) genes, 1 strain carried both bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) genes, 12 strains only carried bla(KPC-2) gene, and 5 strains only carried bla(NDM-1) gene. The 79.3% (23/29) strains were completely resistant to 3 kinds of carbapenems antibiotics. (6) Among the 29 CRKP strains, 3 strains carried K2 gene, 2 of which were completely resistant to 3 kinds of carbapenems antibiotics, 1 strain carried rmpA gene, and no strain carried K1 or K57 gene. Conclusions: The detection rate of CRKP isolated from burn patients hospitalized in our unit is high. The strains are mostly extensively drug-resistant bacteria, and the mechanism of drug resistance of which is complicated. There may have clonal spread of CRKP. And appropriate measures should be taken timely and effectively to prevent nosocomial spread of CRKP.","Chen Z., Xiang J.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2018.11.015,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns
Comprehensive Analyses And Experiments Confirmed Igfbp5 As A Prognostic Predictor Based On An Aging-Genomic Landscape Analysis Of Ovarian Cancer,"Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the malignant diseases of the reproductive system in elderly women.

Subtype classification was used to identify the roles of hub ARGs in OC progression, including function enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. LASSO regression was utilized to confirm the prognosis significance for these hub ARGs. MTT, EdU, Transwell, and wounding healing analysis confirmed the effect of IGFBP5 on the proliferation and migration ability of OC cells. Results: ARGs were ectopically expressed in OC tissues compared to normal ovary tissues. Three molecular subtypes were divided by ARGs for OC patients. There were significant differences in ferroptosis, m6A methylation, prognosis, immune infiltration, angiogenesis, differentiation level, and drug sensitivity among the three groups. LASSO regression indicated that 4 signatures, FOXO4, IGFBP5, OGG1 and TYMS, had important prognosis significance. Moreover, IGFBP5 was significantly correlated with immune infiltration. The hub ARG, IGFBP5, expression was significantly decreased in OC patients compared to normal women. IGFBP5 could also reduce the migration and proliferation ability of OC cells compared to vector and NC groups. Conclusion: IGFBP5 was correlated with OC prognosis and associated with OC migration and proliferation. This gene may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OC patients.","Fan T.-Y., Xu L.-L., Zhang H.-F., Peng J., Liu D., Zou W.-D., Feng W.-J., Qin M., Zhang J., Li H., Li Y.-K.",10.2174/0115680096276852231113111412,Current Cancer Drug Targets
"Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella Aerogenes Clinical Isolates From A Teaching Hospital In Southwestern China: Detailed Molecular Epidemiology, Resistance Determinants, Risk Factors And Clinical Outcomes","Purpose: Little is known about the epidemiology and carbapenem-resistance determinants of carbapenem-resistant K. aerogenes (CRKA) isolated from a single medical center. The present study was initiated to characterize the molecular epidemiology and the carbapenem-resistance mechanisms of CRKA isolated during 2012–2018 from a teaching hospital in southwest China, and to investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CRKA infections as well. Methods: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was employed for epidemiological analysis. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing were used to examine the antibiotic-resistance determinants. Plasmids were extracted and characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and conjugation assays. In order to further investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CRKA infections, a retrospective case–control study was also performed. Results: PFGE analysis showed 32 different PFGE patterns among the 36 non-duplicated CRKA strains collected. Most of the isolates harbored multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes, including 2 (5.6%) carrying bla(NDM-1), 1 (2.8%) harboring bla(KPC-2), 13 (36.1%) carrying ESBL genes, 23 (63.9%) carrying ampC genes, 34 (94.4%) carrying quinolone resistance determinants (QRD) genes and 9 (25%) carrying aminoglycoside resistance determinants (ARD) genes. The outer membrane porins, OmpE35 and OmpE36, were, respectively, lost in 4 and 2 isolates. The efflux pump inhibition experiments were positive in 25 (69.4%) of the CRKA strains. Multivariate analysis indicated that hypo-albuminaemia, invasive procedures, and carbapenem exposure were independent risk factors for acquiring CRKA infections. Conclusion: No clonality relationship was identified among most of the 36 CRKA isolates. The over-expression of ESBLs and AmpC coupled with the efflux pumps contributed to carbapenem resistance in K. aerogenes. Additionally, this is the first report of CRKA isolate co-harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(EBC), bla(ACC), acc (6)-Ib, armA, qnrD and loss of OmpE36 in China. Hypo-albuminaemia, invasive procedures and carbapenem exposure were associated with acquisition of CRKA infections.","Ma D.-Y., Huang H.-Y., Zou H., Wu M.-L., Lin Q.-X., Liu B., Huang S.-F.",10.2147/IDR.S235975,Infection And Drug Resistance
"""Old"" And ""New"" Contaminants And Their Management: Learning From The Past, Looking To The Future","Within the 50 year lifetime of the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (SEGH), we have seen a number of contaminants transfer from being the wonder chemical of their day through to becoming current contaminants of concern. This is also true for a variety of emerging contaminants such as plastic microbeads, pharmaceutical residues, and fire retardant chemicals, amongst others.

The Evaluation Of Tumor Microenvironment Infiltration And The Identification Of Angiogenesis-Related Subgroups In Skin Cutaneous Melanoma,"Background: There are limited studies on the association between angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) and the predictive risk of melanoma, even though angiogenic factors, which are essential for tumor growth and metastasis, might be secreted by angiogenesis-related protein in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). To forecast patient outcomes, this study attempts to develop a predictive risk signature linked to angiogenesis in cutaneous melanoma. Methods: In 650 patients with SKCM, the expression and mutation of ARGs were examined, and this information was related to the clinical prognosis. SKCM patients were split into two groups based on how well they performed on the ARG. The link between ARGs, risk genes, and immunological microenvironment was examined using a range of algorithmic analysis techniques. Based on these five risk genes, an angiogenesis risk signature was created. We developed a nomogram and examined the sensitivity of antineoplastic medications to help the proposed risk model's clinical applicability. Results: The risk model developed by ARGs revealed that the prognosis for the two groups was significantly different. The predictive risk score was negatively connected with memory B cells, activated memory CD4 + T cells, M1 macrophages, and CD8 + T cells, and favorably correlated with dendritic cells, mast cells, and neutrophils. Conclusions: Our findings offer fresh perspectives on prognostic evaluation and imply that ARG modulation is implicated in SKCM. Potential medications for the treatment of individuals with various SKCM subtypes were predicted by drug sensitivity analysis.","Li J., Ren H., Huai H., Li J., Xie P., Li X.",10.1007/s00432-023-04680-8,Journal Of Cancer Research And Clinical Oncology
Novel Fusidic Acid Cream Containing Metal Ions And Natural Products Against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Background: Drug design and development to overcome antimicrobial resistance continues to be an area of research due to the evolution of microbial resistance mechanisms and the necessity for new treatments. Natural products have been used since the dawn of medicine to heal skin infections. The antimicrobial properties of fusidic acid, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate have been studied and are well known. Furthermore, these compounds have different mechanisms of action in targeting microorganisms, either by inhibiting protein synthesis or bacterial cell walls. Therefore, their combination is expected to have synergistic activity in killing bacteria. However, the synergistic antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated in a cream formulation. Therefore, the objectives of this in vitro study were to develop and evaluate the synergistic efficacy of fusidic acid in combinations with natural products, including oleuropein, thyme oil, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate, as a cream to eradicate fusidic-acid-resistant microorganisms in skin infections. Methods: Three different cream formulations were developed, compared, and labeled F1, F2, and F3. The compounds were studied for their antibacterial activity. In addition, the stability of the cream was investigated at 25 °C and 40 °C in plastic jars over three months. Results: The F2 formula has adequate physicochemical properties. Furthermore, it displays stable and better results than the marketed trade product and has potential inhibition zones (ZOI). Interestingly, considerable numbers (9.5%) of fusidic-acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FRSA) isolates possessed a high resistance pattern with MIC ≥ 128 μg/mL. In contrast, most tested FRSA isolates (90.5%) had a low resistance pattern with MIC ≤ 8 μg/mL. Conclusion: In conclusion, the F2 cream made with fusidic acid, oleuropein, thyme oil, zinc sulfate, and copper sulfate in the right amounts has stable physical and chemical properties and has potential against FRSA as an antimicrobial agent.","Naseef H., Sahoury Y., Farraj M., Qurt M., Abukhalil A.D., Jaradat N., Sabri I., Rabba A.K., Sbeih M.",10.3390/pharmaceutics14081638,Pharmaceutics
"Metagenomic Insights Into Taxonomic, Functional Diversity And Inhibitors Of Microbial Biofilms","Microbial cells attached to inert or living surfaces adopt biofilm mode with self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix containing polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA, for protection from adverse external stimuli. Biofilms in hospitals and industries serve as a breeding ground for drug-resistant pathogens and ARG enrichment that are linked to pathogenicity and also impede industrial production process. Biofilm formation, including virulence and pathogenicity, is regulated through quorum sensing (QS), a means of bacterial cell to cell communication for cooperative physiological processes. Hence, QS inhibition through quorum quenching (QQ) is a feasible approach to inhibit biofilm formation. In contrast, biofilms have beneficial roles in promoting plant growth, biocontrol, and wastewater treatment. Furthermore, polymicrobial biofilms can harbour novel compounds and species of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. Hence, surveillance of biofilm microbiome structure and functional attributes is crucial to determine the extent of the risk it poses and to harness its bioactive potential. One of the most preferred approaches to delineate the microbiome is culture-independent metagenomics. In this context, this review article explores the biofilm microbiome in built and natural settings such as agriculture, household appliances, wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, microplastics, and dental biofilm. We have also discussed the recent reports on discoveries of novel QS and biofilm inhibitors through conventional, metagenomics, and machine learning approaches. Finally, we present biofilm-derived novel metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), genomes, and taxa of medical and industrial interest.","Imchen M., Anju V.T., Busi S., Mohan M.S., Subhaswaraj P., Dyavaiah M., Kumavath R.",10.1016/j.micres.2022.127207,Microbiological Research
Climate Change And Resilience For Antimicrobial Stewardship And Infection Prevention,"Purpose of reviewThis review covers recent research regarding the challenges posed by climate change within the areas of antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention, and ways to build resiliency in these fields.Recent findingsInfectious disease patterns are changing as microbes adapt to climate change and changing environmental factors. Capacity for testing and treating infectious diseases is challenged by newly emerging diseases, which exacerbate challenges to antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention.Antimicrobial resistance is accelerated due to environmental factors including air pollution, plastic pollution, and chemicals used in food systems, which are all impacted by climate change.Climate change places infection prevention practices at risk in many ways including from major weather events, increased risk of epidemics, and societal disruptions causing conditions that can overwhelm health systems. Researchers are building resilience by advancing rapid diagnostics and disease modeling, and identifying highly reliable versus low efficiency interventions.SummaryClimate change and associated major weather and socioeconomic events will place significant strain on healthcare facilities. Work being done to advance rapid diagnostics, build supply chain resilience, improve predictive disease modeling and surveillance, and identify high reliability versus low yield interventions will help build resiliency in antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention for escalating challenges due to climate change.","Abeles S.R., Kline A., Lee P.",10.1097/QCO.0000000000001032,Current Opinion In Infectious Diseases
"Recent Advances Towards Micro(Nano)Plastics Research In Wetland Ecosystems: A Systematic Review On Sources, Removal, And Ecological Impacts","In recent years, microplastics/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) have received substantial attention worldwide owing to their wide applications, persistence, and potential risks. Wetland systems are considered to be an important “sink” for MPs/NPs, which can have potential ecological and environmental effects on the ecosystem. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the sources and characteristics of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, together with a detailed analysis of MP/NP removal and associated mechanisms in wetland systems. In addition, the eco-toxicological effects of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, including plant, animal, and microbial responses, were reviewed with a focus on changes in the microbial community relevant to pollutant removal. The effects of MPs/NPs exposure on conventional pollutant removal by wetland systems and their greenhouse gas emissions are also discussed. Finally, current knowledge gaps and future recommendations are presented, including the ecological impact of exposure to various MPs/NPs on wetland ecosystems and the ecological risks of MPs/NPs associated with the migration of different contaminants and antibiotic resistance genes. This work will facilitate a better understanding of the sources, characteristics, and environmental and ecological impacts of MPs/NPs in wetland ecosystems, and provide a new perspective to promote development in this field.","Zhong L., Wu T., Sun H.-J., Ding J., Pang J.-W., Zhang L., Ren N.-Q., Yang S.-S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131341,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Adsorptive Removal Of Ciprofloxacin And Sulfamethoxazole From Aqueous Matrices Using Sawdust And Plastic Waste-Derived Biochar: A Sustainable Fight Against Antibiotic Resistance,"We produced carbon-negative biochar from the pyrolysis of sawdust biomass alone (SB) and from the co-pyrolysis of sawdust and plastic waste (SPB). The co-pyrolysis approach in this study was driven by several hypothetical factors, such as increased porosity, surface chemistry, stability, as well as waste management. We applied pyrolyzed and co-pyrolyzed biochars for the removal of ciprofloxacin (CFX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Due to its more alkaline and amorphous nature, SB showed better removal efficiencies compared to SPB. The maximum removals of CFX and SMX with SB were observed as ∼95% and >95%, respectively whereas with SPB were 58.8%, and 34.9%, respectively. The primary mechanisms involved in the adsorption process were H-bonding, electrostatic and π–π electron donor–acceptor interactions. Homogenously and heterogeneously driven adsorption of both antibiotics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, implying electron sharing/transfer (chemisorption) mediated adsorption. The work is highly pertinent in the context of emerging concerns related to drivers that promote antimicrobial resistance.","Silori R., Zang J., Raval N.P., Giri B.S., Mahlknecht J., Mora A., Dueñas-Moreno J., Tauseef S.M., Kumar M.",10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129537,Bioresource Technology
Effects Of Microplastics On Daphnia-Associated Microbiomes In Situ And In Vitro,"Microplastic pollution in aquatic environments is a growing global concern. Microplastics, defined as plastic fragments smaller than five millimetres, accumulate in freshwater reservoirs, especially in urban areas, impacting resident biota. This study examined the effects of microplastics on the performance and microbiome of Daphnia, a keystone organism in freshwater ecosystems, through both in situ sampling of freshwater ponds and a controlled 23-day in vitro exposure experiment. Using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we analyzed the microbiome's composition and functional capacity in relation to microplastic pollution levels. Urban ponds contained higher microplastic concentrations in water and sediment than natural ponds, with distinct differences in plastic composition. Bacterioplankton communities defined as bacterial assemblages in the water column, were more diverse and richer than Daphnia-associated microbiomes. Overall, the in situ study showed that the composition of the Daphnia-associated community was influenced by many factors including microplastic levels but also temperature and redox potential. Functional analysis showed increased relative abundances of polyethylene terephthalate degradation enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes in microbiomes from high-microplastic ponds. In the in vitro experiment, the bacterioplankton inoculum source significantly influenced Daphnia survival and microbiome composition. Network analysis identified specific taxa associated with microplastics within the Daphnia microbiome. Our findings highlight that urbanisation leads to higher microplastic and antibiotic resistance gene burdens, influencing host-associated microbiomes through taxonomic shifts, functional enrichment, and survival outcomes, with potential implications for the resilience of aquatic ecosystems.","Krzynowek A., Van De Moortel B., Pichler N., Vanoverberghe I., Lapere J., Jenisch L.M., Deloof D., Thielemans W., Muylaert K., Dusselier M., Springael D., Faust K., Decaestecker E.",10.1093/ismejo/wrae234,The Isme Journal
Eradication Of Acinetobacter Baumannii/Enterobacter Cloacae Complex In An Open Proximal Tibial Fracture And Closed Drop Foot Correction With A Multidisciplinary Approach Using The Taylor Spatial Frame(®): A Case Report,"Background: Multi-drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum betalactamase or carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae) are emerging in early-onset infections. So far, there is no report describing the eradication of these bacteria in a osseous infection of an open proximal tibial fracture in combination with the hexapod technology to address both osseous consolidation and closed drop foot correction. Case presentation: After sustaining a proximal tibial fracture (Gustilo 3B), a 41-year-old man was primarily treated with open reduction and internal fixation by a locking plate and split-thickness skin graft in the home country. At the time of admission to our hospital there was a significant anterolateral soft tissue defect covered with an already-necrotic split-thickness graft and suspicious secretion. CAT and MRI scans revealed no signs of osseous healing, intramedullary distinctive osteomyelitis, as well as a large abscess zone in the dorsal compartment. Multiple wound smears showed multi-drug-resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem resistant) as well as Enterobacter cloacae complex (AmpC overexpression). After implant removal, excessive osseous and intramedullary debridements using the Reamer Irrigator Aspirator (RIA(®)) as well as initial negative pressure wound therapy were performed. Colistin hand-modelled chains and sticks were applied topically as well as an adjusted systemic antibiotic scheme was applied. After repetitive surgical interventions, the smears showed bacterial eradication and the patient underwent soft tissue reconstruction with a free vascularized latissimus dorsi muscle flap. External fixation was converted to a hexapod fixator (TSF(®)) to correct primary varus displacement, axial assignment and secure osseous healing. A second ring was mounted to address the fixed drop foot in a closed fashion without further intervention. At final follow-up, 12 months after trauma, the patient showed good functional recovery with osseous healing, intact soft tissue with satisfactory cosmetics and no signs of reinfection. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach with orthopaedic surgeons for debridement, planning and establishing osseous and joint correction and consolidation, plastic surgeons for microvascular muscle flaps for soft tissue defect coverage as well as clinical microbiologists for the optimized anti-infective treatment is essential in these challenging rare cases. Level of evidence: Level IV.","Siebenbürger G., Grabein B., Schenck T., Kammerlander C., Böcker W., Zeckey C.",10.1186/s40001-019-0360-2,European Journal Of Medical Research
Rapid Detection Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Lactic Acid Bacteria Using Pmma-Based Microreactor Arrays,"The emergence of lactic acid bacteria (LABs) resistant to existing antimicrobial drugs is a growing health crisis. To decrease the overuse of antibiotics, molecular diagnostic systems that can rapidly determine the presence of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in LABs from yogurt samples are needed. This paper describes a fully integrated, miniaturized plastic chip and closed-tube detection chemistry that performs multiplex nucleic acid amplification. High-throughput identification of AR genes was achieved through this approach, and six AR genes were analyzed simultaneously in < 2 h. This time-to-result included the time required for the extraction of DNA. The detection limit of the chip was 10(3) CFU mL(−1), which was consistent with that of tube LAMP. We detected and identified multiple DNAs, including streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin resistance-associated genes, with complete concordance to the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.Key Points• The device can be integrated with LAMP for rapid detection of antibiotic resistance genes.• The approach had a high throughput of AR gene analysis in lactic acid bacteria.","Jin Z., Ding G., Yang G., Li G., Zhang W., Yang L., Li W.",10.1007/s00253-020-10699-5,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
Unveiling A High-Risk Epidemic Clone (St 357) Of ‘Difficult To Treat Extensively Drug-Resistant’ (Dt-Xdr) Pseudomonas Aeruginosa From A Burn Patient In Bangladesh: A Resilient Beast Revealing Coexistence Of Four Classes Of Beta Lactamases,"Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) stands out as a key culprit in the colonization of burn wounds, instigating grave infections of heightened severity. In this study, we have performed comparative whole genome analysis of a difficult to treat extensively drug resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from a burn patient in order to elucidate genomic diversity, molecular patterns, mechanisms and genes responsible for conferring antimicrobial resistance and virulence. Method: P. aeruginosa SHNIBPS206 was isolated from an infected burn wound of a critically injured burn patient. Whole genome sequencing was carried out and annotated with Prokka. Sequence type, serotype, antimicrobial resistance genes and mechanisms, virulence genes, metal resistance genes and CRISPR/Cas systems were investigated. Later, pangenome analysis was carried out to find out genomic diversity. Result: P. aeruginosa SHNIBPS206 (MLST 357, Serotype O11) was resistant to 14 antibiotics including carbapenems and harboured all four classes of beta lactamase producing genes: Class A (bla(PME-1), bla(VEB-9)), Class B (bla(NDM-1)), Class C (bla(PDC-11)) and Class D (bla(OXA-846)). Mutational analysis of Porin D gave valuable insights. Several efflux pump, virulence and metal resistance genes were also detected. Pangenome analysis revealed high genomic diversity among different strains of P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an extensively drug resistant ST 357 P. aeruginosa from Bangladesh, which is an epidemic high-risk P. aeruginosa clone. Further research and in-depth comprehensive studies are required to investigate the prevalence of such high-risk clone of P. aeruginosa in Bangladesh.","Mondol S.M., Islam M.R., Rakhi N.N., Shakil S.K., Islam I., Mustary J.F., Amiruzzaman, Shahjalal H.M., Gomes D.J., Rahaman M.M.",10.1016/j.jgar.2023.11.014,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
The Microbial Etiology And Resistance Patterns Of Cosmetic Tourism-Related Infections In Ireland,"Background: Cosmetic tourism is an increasingly common phenomenon, both in Ireland and internationally. Complications associated with procedures performed abroad may manifest after the patient has traveled back to their home country with patients often presenting to local health services. Such complications can be infectious in nature requiring either antimicrobial therapy and/or source control in the form of wound debridement or radiologically guided interventional procedures. Methods: Patients who had presented to a regional plastic surgery unit between September 2021 and December 2022 with complications related to aesthetic procedures performed outside Ireland were identified in this retrospective-prospective design. Medical records were reviewed to ascertain what procedures were performed, where the procedure had taken place, the nature of complications, and microbial culture and sensitivity results. Results: Thirty patients were identified during the study timeframe, predominantly female (n = 28) with a mean age of 40.27 years (SD 10.6). Abdominoplasty was the most common procedure (n = 17), and Turkey was the most frequently cited destination (70%). Wound dehiscence accounted for the majority of complications (n = 18). Wound cultures were obtained in 80% (n = 24) of patients and a causative organism was isolated in 85% (n = 34) of cultures. Eighteen species of bacteria were identified and antimicrobial sensitivities were obtained for 16 of these. Antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed empiric antibiotics was noted in several isolates. Conclusion: Post-operative infections related to cosmetic tourism are a growing concern in plastic surgery. The bacterial etiology is varied, and antimicrobial resistance poses significant challenges, highlighting the need for early intervention and wound cultures to guide effective management.","Keane A., Feeley A.A., Chee S.Y., Sheil F., O’Gorman J., O’Neill E., Cahill K.C.",10.1007/s11845-024-03800-8,Irish Journal Of Medical Science
"Genetic Relatedness, Antibiotic Resistance, And Virulence Of Klebsiella Pneumoniae Isolated From Health Care And Food Sources In Wuhan, China","Background: To investigate genetic relatedness and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae from retail meat samples, clinical source samples, and hospital environmental samples in Wuhan, China. Methods: Hypermucoviscosity and biofilm formation of K. pneumoniae were assessed by string test and crystal violet staining. MICs of 18 antimicrobials were determined by broth microdilution. PCR detected 14 antibiotic resistance genes. Genetic relatedness and clonal dissemination were analyzed by PFGE. Results: Among 5,730 samples, 46 were tested positive for K pneumoniae, with higher rates observed in meat (23.4%) than in clinical samples (0.6%) and hospital environmental samples (8.0%). Meat-derived isolates showed high resistance to tetracycline (36.4%, 4/11), sulfonamide (27.3%, 3/11), and gentamicin (27.3%, 3/11), whereas clinical isolates exhibited significant resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam (32.3%, 10/31). Multidrug resistance was observed in 17.4% (8/46) of the isolates, particularly in hospital environmental samples (3/4). Biofilm production was observed in 88.1% (37/42) of K pneumoniae. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed patient-to-patient K pneumoniae transmission, transmission between patients and hospital environment, as well as cross-contamination between markets. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive surveillance, infection control, and judicious antibiotic use in mitigating the impact of K pneumoniae on public health, especially in the food chain and health care settings.","Tang F., Chen Z., Zhu H., Xi L., Li C., Luo W.",10.1016/j.ajic.2024.05.011,American Journal Of Infection Control
Antimicrobial Activity Of Metal Oxide Microspheres: An Innovative Process For Homogeneous Incorporation Into Materials,"Aims: To investigate the potent control of microbial surface contamination of an innovative process which consists in incorporating metal oxide microspheres homogeneously into materials. Methods and Results: Spherical microspheres containing zinc and magnesium oxides synthesized via a one-step manufacturing process (Pyrolyse Pulvérisée(®)) and incorporated into different plastic matrices were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity according to JIS Z 2801 standard. A significant activity was observed for microsphere-added polyethylene coupons with a reduction of all tested bacteria populations, including Gram negative and Gram positive even expressing acquired antibiotic resistance (Escherichia coli ESBL, Staphylococcus aureus metiR). An antiviral activity higher than 2 log of reduction was also observed on H1N1 and HSV-1 viruses. This antimicrobial effect was dose-dependent and time-dependent for both polyethylene and polypropylene matrices. Antimicrobial activity was maintained after exposition to disinfectants and totally preserved 50 months after the preparation of the coupons. Conclusions: Incorporated into plastic matrices, metal oxide microspheres showed significant antibacterial and antiviral activities. Significance and Impact of Study: This is, to our knowledge, the first report on an original process incorporating metal oxide microspheres, which have specific physico-chemical and antimicrobial properties, into materials that could be used for surface contamination prevention.","Feuillolay C., Haddioui L., Verelst M., Furiga A., Marchin L., Roques C.",10.1111/jam.13752,Journal Of Applied Microbiology
Edna Adsorption Onto Microplastics: Impacts Of Water Chemistry And Polymer Physiochemical Properties,"Adsorption of biomacromolecules onto polymer surfaces, including microplastics (MPs), occurs in multiple environmental compartments, forming an ecocorona. Environmental DNA (eDNA), genetic material shed from organisms, can adsorb onto MPs which can potentially either (1) promote long-range transport of antibiotic resistant genes or (2) serve to gain insights into the transport pathways and origins of MPs by analyzing DNA sequences on MPs. However, little is known about the capacity of MPs to adsorb eDNA or the factors that influence sorption, such as polymer and water chemistries. Here we investigated the adsorption of extracellular linear DNA onto a variety of model MP fragments composed of three of the most environmentally prevalent polymers (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene) in their pristine and photochemically weathered states. Batch adsorption experiments in a variety of water chemistries were complemented with nonlinear modeling to quantify the rate and extent of eDNA sorption. Ionic strength was shown to strongly impact DNA adsorption by reducing or inhibiting electrostatic repulsion. Polyethylene terephthalate exhibited the highest adsorption capacity when normalizing for MP specific surface area, likely due to the presence of ester groups. Kinetics experiments showed fast adsorption (majority adsorbed under 30 min) before eventually reaching equilibrium after 1-2 h. Overall, we demonstrated that DNA quickly binds to MPs, with pseudo-first- and -second-order models describing adsorption kinetics and the Freundlich model describing adsorption isotherms most accurately. These insights into DNA sorption onto MPs show that there is potential for MPs to act as vectors for genetic material of interest, especially considering that particle-bound DNA typically persists longer in the environment than dissolved DNA.","MüLler N.D., Kirtane A., Schefer R.B., Mitrano D.M.",10.1021/acs.est.3c10825,Environmental Science And Technology
Continuous Generation And Release Of Microplastics And Nanoplastics From Polystyrene By Plastic-Degrading Marine Bacteria,"Plastic waste released into the environments breaks down into microplastics due to weathering, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mechanical abrasion, and animal grazing. However, little is known about the plastic fragmentation mediated by microbial degradation. Marine plastic-degrading bacteria may have a double-edged effect in removing plastics. In this study, two ubiquitous marine bacteria, Alcanivorax xenomutans and Halomonas titanicae, were confirmed to degrade polystyrene (PS) and lead to microplastic and nanoplastic generation. Biodegradation occurred during bacterial growth with PS as the sole energy source, and the formation of carboxyl and carboxylic acid groups, decreased heat resistance, generation of PS metabolic intermediates in cultures, and plastic weight loss were observed. The generation of microplastics was dynamic alongside PS biodegradation. The size of the released microplastics gradually changed from microsized plastics on the first day (1344 nm and 1480 nm, respectively) to nanoplastics on the 30th day (614 nm and 496 nm, respectively) by the two tested strains. The peak release from PS films reached 6.29 × 10(6) particles/L and 7.64 × 10(6) particles/L from degradation by A. xenomutans (Day 10) and H. titanicae (Day 5), respectively. Quantification revealed that 1.3% and 1.9% of PS was retained in the form of micro- and nanoplastics, while 4.5% and 1.9% were mineralized by A. xenomutans and H. titanicae at the end of incubation, respectively. This highlights the negative effects of microbial degradation, which results in the continuous release of numerous microplastics, especially nanoplastics, as a notable secondary pollution into marine ecosystems. Their fates in the vast aquatic system and their impact on marine lives are noted for further study.","Lv S., Cui K., Zhao S., Li Y., Liu R., Hu R., Zhi B., Gu L., Wang L., Wang Q., Shao Z.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133339,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Microplastics As Emergent Contaminants In Landfill Leachate: Source, Potential Impact And Remediation Technologies","A significant amount of plastic waste is generated each year on a global scale, in which the maximum quantity of plastic waste is typically dumped in landfills in various parts of the world. Moreover, dumping plastic waste in landfills cannot address the issue of proper disposal; it simply delays the process. Exploiting waste resources entails environmental hazards because plastic wastes buried in landfills gradually break down into Microplastics (MPs) due to physical, chemical, and biological effects. The possibility of landfill leachate as a source of MPs in the environment has not received much attention. Without systematic treatment, MPs in leachate increase the risk to human health and environmental health since they contain dangerous and toxic pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes transmitted by leachate vectors. Due to their severe environmental risks, MPs are now widely recognized as emerging pollutants. Therefore, the composition of MPs in landfill leachate and the interaction of MPs with other hazardous contaminants are summarised in this review. The available potential mitigation or treatment methods of MPs in landfill leachate as of now, along with the drawbacks and challenges of the present leachate treatment for eliminating MPs, are described in this review. Since it is unclear how MPs will be removed from the current leachate facilities, it is crucial to develop innovative treatment facilities as quickly as possible. Finally, the areas that require more research to provide complete solutions to the persistent problem of plastic debris are discussed.","V G., Shanmugavel S.P., Tyagi V.K., Rajesh Banu J.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118240,Journal Of Environmental Management

We analyzed the distribution of pathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing plastic surgery, reviewed the drug resistance of Gram negative (G-) bacteria and Gram positive (G+) bacteria, and analyzed the effects of surgical duration, prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, length of stay (LOS), and preoperative hair removal on infection after plastic surgery.RESULTS: G+ bacteria (mainly Staphylococcus aureus) accounted for 45.6%, while G- bacteria (mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) accounted for 54.4% of total pathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing plastic surgery. The most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefotaxime; the most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Klebsiella pneumoniae were sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. The most commonly resistant antibacterial agents of Staphylococcus aureus were penicillin G, ampicillin, and sulfamethoxazole; for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, the most commonly resistant antibacterial agents were also penicillin G, ampicillin, and sulfamethoxazole. Both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Multi-factor logistic regression analysis showed that surgical duration >3 hours, no prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, and LOS>7 days were independent risk factors for postoperative infection.CONCLUSIONS: G- bacteria were more prevalent in infections after plastic surgery, and most bacteria were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Strict control of surgical duration, short LOS, intraoperative prophylactic use of antibacterial agents, and no preoperative hair removal were important for reducing postoperative infection.","Wang G., Zhang S.",10.23736/S0026-4733.17.07295-9,Minerva Chirurgica
Emerging Prevalence And Clinical Features Of Elizabethkingia Meningoseptica Infection In Southwest China: A 9-Year Retrospective Study And Systematic Review,"Background: Elizabethkingia meningoseptica infections have gradually emerged as life-threatening nosocomial infections world-wide, accompanied by increasing incidence, multidrug resistance and poor outcomes. However, the epidemiology and clinical features of E. meningoseptica infection are still limited in mainland China. Methods: Patients with E. meningoseptica infections from 2011 to 2019 in southwestern China were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, infection patterns and outcomes were extracted from medical records and analyzed. A comprehensive systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from conception to August 23, 2021. Results: Ninety-two patients were ultimately included, with the prevalence rapidly rising from 0 in 2011 to 0.19 per 1000 inpatients in 2019. A total of 93.48% of E. meningoseptica isolates were multidrug resistant, including 100% resistance to carbapenem. Furthermore, 75% of E. meningoseptica infections were concomitant with other pathogens. The mortality of our cohort was 36.96%, with risk factors for mechanical ventilation (OR=9.51, P=0.004), male sex (OR=0.27, P=0.031) and more concomitant pathogens. After propensity score matching, central venous catheters, exposure to carbapenem and antifungal drugs, and underlying tumors were associated with E. meningoseptica infection. Sixteen articles were also summarized, with reported mortality rates ranging from 11.0% to 66.6%. Blood and respiratory tract were the common sources. Piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolone and minocycline were the most sensitive antibiotics. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment was the most commonly reported risk factor for mortality. Conclusion: Nosocomial infection with E. meningoseptica has become an emerging problem with high mortality in southwestern China. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and central venous catheters are risk factors for infection and death and should receive adequate attention.","Ma S., Gong Y., Luo X., Peng Y., Zhang C., Zhang X., Hu X., Tang P., Yuan Z., Luo G., Li H.",10.2147/IDR.S397051,Infection And Drug Resistance
"Carriage Rate Of Neisseria Meningitidis, Antibiotic Susceptibility Pattern And Associated Risk Factors Among Primary School Children In Gondar Town, Northwest Ethiopia","Background: Globally, in 2012, about 1.2 million estimated cases were reported with ~ 135,000 deaths annually. In Ethiopia, specifically in our study area, limited information is found on the oropharyngeal carriage, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and associated risk factors for N. meningitidis among school children. So, the aim of this study was to assess oropharyngeal carriage rate of N. meningitidis, antibiotic susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors among primary school children in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from January to April, 2019 in Gondar town. Multi stage simple random sampling technique was used. A total of 524 oropharyngeal swabs were collected using sterile plastic cotton swabs. Modified Thayer Martin media was used for primary isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was done based on Kirby-Bauer method on Muller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance of an isolate to two or more antimicrobial classes tested. Logistic regression model was used to see the association between dependent variables (Carriage rate of Neisseria meningitidis, Serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis and Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns) and independent variables (Socio-demographic data and risk factors). Variables with a P-value ≤0.2 during bivariable analysis was taken to multivariable analysis to check significant association of meningococcal carriage with risk factors. Finally, a P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data was summarized using numbers, percentages and tables. Results: A total of 53(10.1%) (CI: 7.6-12.8) N. meningitidis isolates were identified. Serogroup A 13 (24.5%) was the most prevalent followed by Y/W135 11(20.7%) whereas serogroup B 4(7.6%) was the least identified serotype. Meningococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (45.3%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.6%). Overall, most of meningococcal isolates showed about 32(60.4%) multidrug resistance. Meningococcal carriage rate was significantly associated with family size, tonsillectomy, passive smoking, number of students per class, sharing utensils, history of visiting healthcare institutions, and indoor kitchen. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for reinforcement of case-based, laboratory confirmed surveillance of N. meningitidis carriage in Ethiopian elementary school students to enable mapping of distribution of serotypes of the causative organisms across the country and determine the current potential necessity of vaccination.","Tefera Z., Mekonnen F., Tiruneh M., Belachew T.",10.1186/s12879-020-05080-w,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Antibiotic Therapy In Reconstructive Surgery Of Deep Sternal Wound Infections,"The choice of antibiotics and length of administration in the treatment of deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) is unclear. The reason for this is the lack of studies and local differences in resistance. An increase in resistance can be observed in gram-positive cocci, which are the most frequently detected in deep sternal infections. The duration of administration is often 2- 6 weeks or longer, although the benefit of prolonged antibiotic administration has not been confirmed by studies. We evaluated the antibiotic treatment during surgical treatment, consisting of surgical wound debridement and plastic chest reconstruction. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients (n = 260) who underwent reconstructive surgery in the Department of Plastic Surgery at Leipzig University Hospital from 01.05.2012 - 31.12.2020. The duration of intake, results of microbiological swabs and resistance were investigated. RESULTS: At the time of discharge, closed wound conditions were noted in 177 of 260 cases (68.1%). The largest proportion of patients (n = 238) was treated with a latissimus dorsi flap (91.5%). Antibiotic treatment was conducted in 206 of 260 cases (79.2%). The mean duration of antibiotic administration was 21.4 days (±17.6). Prolonged treatment over 14 days did not alter outcome (p = 0.226), in contrast, the number of multidrug resistances (p < 0.001). There was no prove of resistance against linezolid which is effective against the most common found infectious agents Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 93; 24.0 %) Staphylococcus aureus (n = 47; 12.1 %). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotic therapy over 14 days, whereas multidrug resistance increases with prolonged antibiotic use. In the absence of infectious agents or clinical signs of inflammation, surgical treatment without additional antibiotic treatment is effective. Linezolid is a suitable antibiotic in the treatment of gram-positive infections which are the most frequent in DSWI.","Unbehaun P., Prantl L., Langer S., Spindler N.",10.3233/CH-238121,Clinical Hemorheology And Microcirculation
"Olmutinib (Bi1482694/Hm61713), A Novel Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Reverses Abcg2-Mediated Multidrug Resistance In Cancer Cells","The main characteristic of tumor cell resistance is multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR is the principle cause of the decline in clinical efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. There are several mechanisms that could cause MDR. Among these, one of the most important mechanisms underlying MDR is the overexpression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) super-family of transporters, which effectively pump out cytotoxic agents and targeted anticancer drugs across the cell membrane. In recent years, studies found that ABC transporters and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) interact with each other. TKIs may behave as substrates or inhibitors depending on the expression of specific pumps, drug concentration, their affinity for the transporters and types of co-administered agents. Therefore, we performed in vitro experiments to observe whether olmutinib could reverse MDR in cancer cells overexpressing ABCB1, ABCG2, or ABCC1 transporters. The results showed that olmutinib at 3 μM significantly reversed drug resistance mediated by ABCG2, but not by ABCB1 and ABCC1, by antagonizing the drug efflux function in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. In addition, olmutinib at reversal concentration affected neither the protein expression level nor the localization of ABCG2. The results observed from the accumulation/efflux study of olmutinib showed that olmutinib reversed ABCG2-mediated MDR with an increasing intracellular drug accumulation due to inhibited drug efflux. We also had consistent results with the ATPase assay that olmutinib stimulated ATPase activity of ABCG2 up to 3.5-fold. Additionally, the molecular interaction between olmutinib and ABCG2 was identified by docking simulation. Olmutinib not only interacts directly with ABCG2 but also works as a competitive inhibitor of the transport protein. In conclusion, olmutinib could reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR. The reversal effect of olmutinib on ABCG2-mediated MDR cells is not due to ABCG2 expression or intracellular localization, but rather related to its interaction with ABCG2 protein resulting in drug efflux inhibition and ATPase stimulation.","Zhang W., Fan Y.-F., Cai C.-Y., Wang J.-Q., Teng Q.-X., Lei Z.-N., Zeng L., Gupta P., Chen Z.-S.",10.3389/fphar.2018.01097,Frontiers In Pharmacology
Visible-Light-Driven Photoreforming Of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Plastics Via Carbon Nitride Porous Microtubes,"It is highly desirable but challenging to realize efficient photoreforming of plastic waste over metal-free semiconductors. Here, we synthesized metal-free carbon nitride porous microtube (CN(x)PM) photocatalysts by carrying out a pyrolysis of the supramolecular assembly formed by the self-assembly of l-arginine (l-Arg) and melamine, the modification of l-Arg rationally engineering the microstructure and electronic structure of the CN(x)PM system for efficient visible-light-driven photoreforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to hydrogen (H(2)) and high-value chemicals. In particular, the amount of formate converted from PET substrate under visible light was highest in metal-free semiconductors without any co-catalyst reported so far, presenting the first example of visible-light-driven photoreforming of PET over a completely metal-free single-component semiconductor without any co-catalyst.","Guo S., Huang Y., Li D., Xie Z., Jia Y., Wu X., Xu D., Shi W.",10.1039/d3cc02012f,Chemical Communications
Connecting The Dots: Livestock Animals As Missing Links In The Chain Of Microplastic Contamination And Human Health,"Plastic pollution is a global diffuse threat, especially considering its fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). Since the contamination of the aquatic environment is already well studied, most studies have now focused on the soil. Moreover, the number of studies on the exposure routes and toxic effects of MNPs in humans is continuously increasing. Although MNPs can cause inflammation, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and immune toxicity in livestock animals, which can accumulate ingested/inhaled plastic particles and transfer them to humans through the food chain, research on this topic is still lacking. In considering farm animals as the missing link between soil/plant contamination and human health effects, this paper aims to describe their importance as carriers and vectors of MNP contamination. As research on this topic is in its early stages, there is no standard method to quantify the amount and the characteristics of MNPs in different matrices. Therefore, the creation of a common database where researchers can report data on MNP characteristics and quantification methods could be helpful for both method standardization and the future training of an AI tool for predicting the most abundant/dangerous polymer(s), thus supporting policy decisions to reduce plastic pollution and perfectly fitting with One Health principles.","Corte Pause F., Urli S., Crociati M., Stradaioli G., Baufeld A.",10.3390/ani14020350,Animals
Microbiology And Risk Factors Associated With War-Related Wound Infections In The Middle East,"The Middle East region is plagued with repeated armed conflicts that affect both civilians and soldiers. Injuries sustained during war are common and frequently associated with multiple life-threatening complications. Wound infections are major consequences of these war injuries. The microbiology of war-related wound infections is variable with predominance of Gram-negative bacteria in later stages. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates affecting war-related wound injuries is a serious problem with major regional and global implications. Factors responsible for the increase in multidrug-resistant pathogens include timing and type of surgical management, wide use of antimicrobial drugs, and the presence of metallic or organic fragments in the wound. Nosocomial transmission is the most important factor in the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Wound management of war-related injuries merits a multidisciplinary approach. This review aims to describe the microbiology of war-related wound infections and factors affecting their incidence from conflict areas in Iraq, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon.","Sahli Z.T., Bizri A.R., Abu-Sittah G.S.",10.1017/S0950268816000431,Epidemiology And Infection
"Survival, Persistence, And Isolation Of The Emerging Multidrug-Resistant Pathogenic Yeast Candida Auris On A Plastic Health Care Surface","The emerging multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast Candida auris represents a serious threat to global health. Unlike most other Candida species, this organism appears to be commonly transmitted within health care facilities and causes health care-associated outbreaks. To better understand the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen, we investigated the ability of C. auris to persist on plastic surfaces common in health care settings compared with that of Candida parapsilosis, a species known to colonize the skin and plastics. Specifically, we compiled comparative and quantitative data essential to understanding the vehicles of spread and the ability of both species to survive and persist on plastic surfaces under controlled conditions (25°C and 57% relative humidity), such as those found in health care settings. When a test suspension of 104 cells was applied and dried on plastic surfaces, C. auris remained viable for at least 14 days and C. parapsilosis for at least 28 days, as measured by CFU. However, survival measured by esterase activity was higher for C. auris than C. parapsilosis throughout the 28-day study. Given the notable length of time Candida species survive and persist outside their host, we developed methods to more effectively culture C. auris from patients and their environment. Using our enrichment protocol, public health laboratories and researchers can now readily isolate C. auris from complex microbial communities (such as patient skin, nasopharynx, and stool) as well as environmental biofilms, in order to better understand and prevent C. auris colonization and transmission.","Welsh R.M., Bentz M.L., Shams A., Houston H., Lyons A., Rose L.J., Litvintseva A.P.",10.1128/JCM.00921-17,Journal Of Clinical Microbiology
First Identification Of A Patient With Prosthesis-Related Infection Caused By An Mcr-1.1-Producing St131 Escherichia Coli After Rhinoplasty,"Background: The most common procedure of rhinoplasty is the implantation of a synthetic prosthesis. However, the complications, especially postoperative infection, could lead the suboptimal aesthetic outcome, economic losses and health threats. There is currently little literature providing an incidence of rhinoplasty infection and microbiological and antimicrobial resistance situations. Methods: Therefore, we performed a retrospective observational study which included 173 patients who received a rhinoplasty from 1 January 2015, to 31 December 2019, in the department of plastic surgery of a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China. The samples from the infection site were collected and performed the bacterial culture. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by VITEK and minimum inhibition concentration testing. The whole-genome sequencing was performed by Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. Results: We found that eight (4.6%) patients were infected by S. aureus (6), E. raffinosus (1) and E. coli (1), of which are susceptible to most antimicrobials. Remarkably, E. coli RS1231 was resistant to colistin and polymyxin B which conferred by mcr-1.1 locating on an IncI2 plasmid with 59,170-bp sequence length. Through sequence comparison, we speculate that the pRS1231S-MCR-1 was derived from animal sources. Besides, E. coli RS1231 belongs to ST131 O25:H4-fimH22 pandemic subclone and phylogroup B2, which can induce a broad variety of infections. Conclusion: Our study provided a rhinoplasty infection incidence, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance prevalence data, and revealed, to our knowledge, the first case of postoperative infection of rhinoplasty by mcr-1.1-positive, highly susceptible, and remarkably virulent E. coli isolate.","Li Z., Shi R., Wu H., Yan P.",10.2147/IDR.S295801,Infection And Drug Resistance
Making Medical Devices Safer: Impact Of Plastic And Silicone Oil On Microbial Biofilm Formation,"Background: Medical devices face the challenge of microbial biofilm attached to the surface. Ultimately, this may jeopardize the function of the device and increase the patient's risk of infection. However, reliable methods to prevent biofilm are lacking. Aim: To investigate the effect of silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic, used in a new automatic urinometer, on biofilm formation; furthermore, to explore the impact of silicone oil viscosity and compare polypropylene with polystyrene, another common medical plastic. Methods: Common pathogens, including extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) -producing and multi-drug-resistant bacteria, as well as Candida albicans, were investigated. Isogenic Escherichia coli strains deficient in the important biofilm forming factors curli, cellulose and type 1 fimbriae (fim D) were used to determine the possible mode of action by silicone oil. Clear flat-bottomed polypropylene or polystyrene wells were pretreated with either low- or medium-viscosity silicone oil and microbes were added. After 72 h, biofilm formation was quantified using crystal violet assay. Findings: Silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic surfaces, regardless of the oil viscosity, significantly inhibited biofilm formation of all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including ESBL-producing and multi-drug resistant strains, as well as C. albicans. Silicone oil did not affect bacterial or candida growth and curli fimbriae were found to be the main target of silicone oil. Polypropylene plastic itself without oil had a better effect in preventing biofilm formation than polystyrene. Conclusion: These findings suggest a new strategy to decrease microbial biofilm formation, which may reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent dysfunction of medical devices.","Slettengren M., Mohanty S., Kamolvit W., Van Der Linden J., Brauner A.",10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.011,Journal Of Hospital Infection
"Klebsiella Pneumoniae St147 Harboring Bla(Ndm-1), Multidrug Resistance And Hypervirulence Plasmids","The spread of hypervirulent (hv) and carbapenem-/multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging problem in healthcare settings. The New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (bla(NDM-1)) is found in Enterobacteriaceae including K. pneumoniae. The bla(NDM-1) is capable of hydrolyzing β-lactam antibiotics which are used for treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This is associated with the unacceptably high mortality rate in immunocompromised burn injury patients. This study reports on the characterization of bla(NDM-1) gene and virulence factors in hv carbapenem-/multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae ST147 in the burns unit of a tertiary teaching hospital during routine surveillance. Two K. pneumoniae strains were obtained from wounds of burn-infected patients from May 2020 to July 2021. The hypervirulence genes and genetic context of the bla(NDM-1) gene and mobile genetic elements potentially involved in the transposition of the gene were analyzed. We identified a conserved genetic background and an IS26 and open reading frame flanking the bla(NDM-1) gene that could suggest its involvement in the mobilization of the gene. The plasmid harbored additional antibiotic resistance predicted regions that were responsible for resistance to almost all the routinely used antibiotics. To ensure the identification of potential outbreak strains during routine surveillance, investigations on resistance genes and their environment in relation to evolution are necessary for molecular epidemiology. IMPORTANCE Data obtained from this study will aid in the prompt identification of disease outbreaks including evolving resistance and virulence of the outbreak bacteria. This will help establish and implement antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection prevention protocols in fragile health systems in countries with limited resources. Integration of molecular surveillance and translation of whole-genome sequencing in routine diagnosis will provide valuable data for control of infection. This study reports for the first time a high-risk clone K. pneumoniae ST147 with hypervirulence and multidrug-resistance features in Ghana.","Ofosu-Appiah F., Acquah E.E., Mohammed J., Addo C.S., Agbodzi B., Ofosu D.A.S., Myers C.J., Mohktar Q., Ampomah O.-W., Ablordey A., Amissah N.A.",10.1128/spectrum.03017-23,Microbiology Spectrum
The Applications Of Animal Models In Phage Therapy: An Update,"The rapid increase in antibiotic resistance presents a dire situation necessitating the need for alternative therapeutic agents.

Establishment And Characterization Of Triple Drug Resistant Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines,"Resistance to chemotherapy leading to poor outcome and survival remains a challenge for developing strategies for therapeutic interventions in all types of cancer, including head and neck cancer. In vitro chemoresistant cell line models are an indispensable resource towards delineating the mechanisms involved in drug resistance/response and for the development of novel drugs. Current treatment for head and neck cancer includes chemotherapy with cisplatin, docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the response rates to these drugs in patients is 60-80%. The present study aimed to generate head and neck cancer triple drug-resistant cell lines in an effort towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance and providing a resourceful tool for drug design. Using two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, Hep-2 (larynx) and CAL-27 (oral cavity), the present study sequentially exposed these cells to increasing concentrations of the combination of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU (TPF) to generate triple drug-resistant cells, termed Hep-2 TPF resistant (TPFR) and CAL-27 TPFR. The effect of the drug treatments on the cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle and the expression of genes associated with multidrug resistance were analyzed in the parental cells and drug-resistant counterparts.","Govindan S.V., Kulsum S., Pandian R.S., Das D., Seshadri M., Hicks W., Kuriakose M.A., Suresh A.",10.3892/mmr.2015.3768,Molecular Medicine Reports
Management Of Biofilm With Breast Implant Surgery,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand how bacteria negatively impact aesthetic and reconstructive breast implants. 2. Understand how bacteria infect breast implants. 3. Understand the evidence associated with common implant infection-prevention strategies, and their limitations. 4. Understand why implementation of bacteria-mitigation strategies such as antibiotic administration or ""no-touch"" techniques may not indefinitely prevent breast implant infection. SUMMARY: Bacterial infection of aesthetic and reconstructive breast implants is a common and expensive problem. Subacute infections or chronic capsular contractures leading to device explantation are the most commonly documented sequelae. Although bench and translational research underscores the complexities of implant-associated infection, high-quality studies with adequate power, control groups, and duration of follow-up are lacking. Common strategies to minimize infections use antibiotics-administered systemically, in the breast implant pocket, or by directly bathing the implant before insertion-to limit bacterial contamination. Limiting contact between the implant and skin or breast parenchyma represents an additional common strategy. The clinical prevention of breast implant infection is challenged by the clean-contaminated nature of breast parenchyma, and the variable behavior of not only specific bacterial species but also their strains. These factors impact bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance.","Myckatyn T.M., Duran Ramirez J.M., Walker J.N., Hanson B.M.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000010791,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Successful Treatment With Hla-Matched Peripheral Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation For Very Severe Hepatitis-Associated Aplastic Anemia Complicated With Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial And Fungal Infections: A Case Report,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a life-threatening hematologic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the first-line treatment for HAAA. Severe infection and complications in patients with very severe aplastic anemia are the challenges to the efficacy of HSCT. We report a rare case of successful transplantation with HLA-matched peripheral hematopoietic stem cells for a 15-year-old girl suffering from HAAA with multidrug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections. Through effectively controlling infection and optimal timing of transplantation by adjusting the conditioning regimen, the allo-HSCT was successfully performed for the patient.

Tetrandrine Interaction With Abcb1 Reverses Multidrug Resistance In Cancer Cells Through Competition With Anti-Cancer Drugs Followed By Downregulation Of Abcb1 Expression,"The overexpression of ABC transporters induced by anticancer drugs has been found to be the main cause of multidrug resistance. It is actually also a strategy by which cancer cells escape being killed. Tetrandrine is a natural product extracted from the stem of Tinospora crispa. In this study, tetrandrine showed synergistic cytotoxic activity in combinational use with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Paclitaxel, in both drug-induced and MDR1 gene-transfected cancer cells that over-expressed ABCB1/P-glycoprotein. Tetrandrine stimulated P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, decreased the efflux of [3H]-Paclitaxel and increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-Paclitaxel in KB-C2 cells. Furthermore, SW620/Ad300 and KB-C2 cells pretreated with 1 μM tetrandrine for 72 h decreased P-glycoprotein expression without changing its cellular localization. This was demonstrated through Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Interestingly, down-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression was not correlated with gene transcription, as the MDR1 mRNA level exhibited a slight fluctuation in SW620/Ad300 and KB-C2 cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h treatment time points. In addition, molecular docking analysis predicted that tetrandrine had inhibitory potential with the ABCB1 transporter. Our results suggested that tetrandrine can antagonize MDR in both drug-selected and MDR1 gene-transfected cancer cells by down regulating the expression of the ABCB1 transporter, followed by increasing the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic agents. The combinational therapy using tetrandrine and other anticancer drugs could promote the treatment efficiency of drugs that are substrates of ABCB1.","Liao D., Zhang W., Gupta P., Lei Z.-N., Wang J.-Q., Cai C.-Y., Vera A.A., Zhang L., Chen Z.-S., Yang D.-H.",10.3390/molecules24234383,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)"
Microbiology And Antibiotic Sensitivity Of Head And Neck Space Infections Of Odontogenic Origin. Differences In Inpatient And Outpatient Management,"Introduction The microbial flora of infections of the orofacial region of odontogenic origin is typically polymicrobial. Shortly after mass production of the first antibiotics, antibiotic resistant microorganisms were observed. Methods A 28-months retrospective study evaluated hospital records of 107 patients that were treated for head and neck infections of odontogenic origin. All patients underwent surgical incision and drainage. Results There were 65 male (61%) and 42 female (39%) patients ranging in age from 5 to 91 years, with a mean age of 48 years (SD = 21). 52 patients underwent outpatient management and 55 patients inpatient management. A total of 92 bacterial strains were isolated from 107 patients, accounting for 0.86 isolates per patient. Overall 46 bacterial strains were isolated from patients that underwent outpatient and 34 bacterial strains that underwent inpatient treatment. 32.6% of the strains, isolated from outpatient treated individuals showed resistances against one or more of the tested antibiotics. Isolated strains of inpatient treated individuals showed resistances in 52.9%. Discussion According to this study's data, penicillin continues to be a highly effective antibiotic to be used against viridans streptococci, group C Streptococci and prevotella, whereas clindamycin was not shown to be effective as an empirical drug of choice for most odontogenic infections. Conclusion Microorganisms that show low susceptibility to one or more of the standard antibiotic therapy regimes have a significantly higher chance of causing serious health problems, a tendency of spreading and are more likely to require an inpatient management with admission of IV antibiotics. Penicillin continues to be a highly effective antibiotic to be used against viridans streptococci, group C Streptococci and prevotella, whereas clindamycin could not be shown to be effective as an empirical drug of choice for a high number of odontogenic infections.","Heim N., Faron A., Wiedemeyer V., Reich R., Martini M.",10.1016/j.jcms.2017.07.013,Journal Of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery
"The Dissemination Of Antibiotics And Their Corresponding Resistance Genes In Treated Effluent-Soil-Crops Continuum, And The Effect Of Barriers","Irrigation with treated effluent is expanding as freshwater sources diminish, but hampered by growing concerns of pharmaceuticals contamination, specifically antibiotics and resistance determinants. To evaluate this concern, freshwater and effluent were applied to an open field that was treated with soil barriers including plastic mulch together with surface and subsurface drip irrigation, cultivating freshly eaten crops (cucumbers or melons) for two consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that the effluent carries antibiotics and resistance determinants to the drip-irrigated soil and crops regardless of the treatment. To test our hypothesis, we monitored for antibiotics abundance (erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, and ofloxacin) and their corresponding resistance genes (ermB, ermF, sul1, tetW, tetO, bla(TEM) and qnrB), together with class 1 integron (intl1), and bacterial 16S rRNA, in water, soil, and crop samples taken over two years of cultivation. The results showed that an array of antibiotics and their corresponding resistance genes were detected in the effluent but not the freshwater. Yet, there were no significant differences in the distribution or abundance of antibiotics and resistance genes, regardless of the irrigation water quality, or crop type (p > 0.05), but plastic-covered soil irrigated with effluent retained the antibiotics oxytetracycline and ofloxacin (p < 0.05). However, we could not detect significant correlations between the detected antibiotics and the corresponding resistance genes. Overall, our findings disproved our hypothesis suggesting that treated effluent may not carry antibiotics resistance genes to the irrigated soil and crops yet, plastic mulch covered soil retain some antibiotics that may inflict long term contamination.","Seyoum M.M., Obayomi O., Bernstein N., Williams C.F., Gillor O.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151525,Science Of The Total Environment
"Microplastic Pollution Interaction With Disinfectant Resistance Genes: Research Progress, Environmental Impacts, And Potential Threats","The consumption of disposable plastic products and disinfectants has surged during the global COVID-19 pandemic, as they play a vital role in effectively preventing and controlling the spread of the virus. However, microplastic pollution and the excessive or improper use of disinfectants contribute to the increased environmental tolerance of microorganisms. Microplastics play a crucial role as vectors for microorganisms and plankton, facilitating energy transfer and horizontal gene exchange. The increase in the use of disinfectants has become a driving force for the growth of disinfectant resistant bacteria (DRB). A large number of microorganisms can have intense gene exchange, such as plasmid loss and capture, phage transduction, and cell fusion. The reproduction and diffusion rate of DRB in the environment is significantly higher than that of ordinary microorganisms, which will greatly increase the environmental tolerance of DRB. Unfortunately, there is still a huge knowledge gap in the interaction between microplastics and disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs). Accordingly, it is critical to comprehensively summarize the formation and transmission routes of DRGs on microplastics to address the problem. This paper systematically analyzed the process and mechanisms of DRGs formed by microbes. The interaction between microplastics and DRGs and the contribution of microplastic on the diffusion and spread of DRGs were expounded. The potential threats to the ecological environment and human health were also discussed. Additionally, some challenges and future priorities were also proposed with a view to providing useful basis for further research.","Zhang J., Li T., Tao S., Shen M.",10.1007/s11356-024-32225-0,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
"Shining Light On Multi-Drug Resistant Candida Auris: Ultraviolet-C Disinfection, Wavelength Sensitivity, And Prevention Of Biofilm Formation Of An Emerging Yeast Pathogen","Candida auris is an emerging fungal superbug of worldwide interest. It is associated with high mortality rates and exhibits increased resistance to antifungals. Ultraviolet subtype C (UVC) light can be used to disinfect surfaces to mitigate its spread. The objectives of this study were (1) To investigate UVC disinfection performances and wavelength sensitivity of C. auris. (2) To evaluate the UVC dose required for the prevention of biofilm formation on stainless-steel, plastic (polystyrene), and poly-cotton fabric surfaces. C. auris was grown following standard procedures. The study utilized six different UVC LED arrays with wavelengths between 252 and 280 nm. Arrays were set at similar intensities, to obtain doses of 5–40 mJ cm(−2) and similar irradiation time. Disinfection performance for each array was determined using log reduction value (LRV) and percentage reduction by comparing the controls against the irradiated treatments. Evaluation of the ability of 267 nm UVC LEDs to prevent C. auris biofilm formation was investigated using stainless-steel, plastic coupons, and poly-cotton fabric. Peak sensitivity to UVC disinfection was between 267 and 270 nm. With 20 mJ cm(−2), the study obtained ≥LRV3. On stainless-steel coupons, 30 mJ cm(−2) was sufficient to prevent biofilm formation, while on plastic, this required 10 mJ cm(−2). A dose of 60 mJ cm(−2) reduced biofilms on poly-cotton fabric significantly (R(2) = 0.9750, p = 0.0002). The study may allow for the design and implementation of disinfection systems.","Mariita R.M., Davis J.H., Lottridge M.M., Randive R.V.",10.1002/mbo3.1261,Microbiologyopen
Changing Bacterial Etiology And Antimicrobial Resistance Profiles As Prognostic Determinants Of Diabetic Foot Infections: A Ten-Year Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background: In this single-center study, we analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) between 2011 and 2020. Patients and Methods: The first and second five-year periods were compared. A poor prognosis was defined as a primary composite end point including re-infection, major amputation, or mortality at six months. Results: A total of 484 patients were enrolled. Overall, 269 patients had the primary composite end point. A substantial decrease was detected in the second five-year period in terms of re-infection (n = 132, 66.0% vs. n = 68, 23.9%; p < 0.001) and mortality (n = 22, 11.0% vs. n = 7, 2.5%; p < 0.001). A total of 798 micro-organisms were isolated from 484 patients. A substantial increase was detected in polymicrobial infections (48.5% vs. 65.1%; p = 0.001) as well as Streptococcus spp. (2.5% vs. 9.2%; p = 0.003), Corynebacterium spp. (9.5% vs. 22.9%; p < 0.001), and extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (3.0% vs. 12.7%; p < 0.001) in the second five-year period, whereas the prevalence of multi-drug-resistanct (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.0% vs. 10.2%; p = 0.029) and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (7.5% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.017) decreased. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (odds ratio [OR], 1.917; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.074-3.420; p = 0.028) and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (OR, 3.069; 95% CI, 1.114-8.453; p = 0.030) were independent predictors for poor prognosis.

"Detection, Survival, And Persistence Of Staphylococcus Capitis Nrcs-A In Neonatal Units In England","Background: The multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus capitis clone, NRCS-A, is increasingly associated with late-onset sepsis in low birthweight newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in England and globally. Understanding where this bacterium survives and persists within the NICU environment is key to developing and implementing effective control measures. Aim: To investigate the potential for S. capitis to colonize surfaces within NICUs. Methods: Surface swabs were collected from four NICUs with and without known NRCS-A colonizations/infections present at the time of sampling. Samples were cultured and S. capitis isolates analysed via whole-genome sequencing. Survival of NRCS-A on plastic surfaces was assessed over time and compared to that of non-NRCS-A isolates. The bactericidal activity of commonly used chemical disinfectants against S. capitis was assessed. Findings: Of 173 surfaces sampled, 40 (21.1%) harboured S. capitis with 30 isolates (75%) being NRCS-A. Whereas S. capitis was recovered from surfaces across the NICU, the NRCS-A clone was rarely recovered from outside the immediate neonatal bedspace. Incubators and other bedside equipment were contaminated with NRCS-A regardless of clinical case detection. In the absence of cleaning, S. capitis was able to survive for three days with minimal losses in viability (<0.5 log(10) reduction). Sodium troclosene and a QAC-based detergent/disinfectant reduced S. capitis to below detectable levels. Conclusion: S. capitis NRCS-A can be readily recovered from the NICU environment, even in units with no recent reported clinical cases of S. capitis infection, highlighting a need for appropriate national guidance on cleaning within the neonatal care environment.","Moore G., Barry A., Carter J., Ready J., Wan Y., Elsayed M., Haill C., Khashu M., Williams O.M., Brown C.S., Demirjian A., Ready D.",10.1016/j.jhin.2023.06.030,Journal Of Hospital Infection
Black Phosphorus Nanosheets-Based Hydrogel For Efficient Bacterial Inhibition And Accelerating Wound Healing,"With the swift evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria resulting from the intense and inappropriate use of antibiotics, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions. In this study, a thermosensitive hydrogel was developed for efficient bacterial inhibition and promotion of wound healing. The antibacterial chitosan (CS) thermosensitive hydrogel, cross-linked with two-dimensional photothermal nanomaterial black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets through electrostatic interactions, effectively encapsulates and sustains the release of angiogenic drug deferoxamine mesylate (DFO). This facilitates the acceleration of re-epithelialization and neovascularization by enhancing cell migration and proliferation. Following near-infrared (NIR) treatment, this hydrogel demonstrates rapid eradication of the most common multidrug-resistant bacteria encountered in clinical settings, achieved through physical disruption of bacterial membranes and photothermal therapies. Noteworthy is the significant upregulation of IL-19 expression via STAT3 signaling pathways by the BP/CS-DFO hydrogel in a full-thickness wound model. This results in the polarization of the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype, altering the microenvironment to a pro-healing state and enhancing extracellular matrix deposition and blood vessel formation. In conclusion, the BP/CS-DFO hydrogel shows immense promise as a potential clinical candidate for wound healing and antimicrobial therapy. Its innovative design and multifunctional capabilities position it as a valuable asset in combating antibiotic resistance and enhancing efficiency in wound healing.","Su X., Chi Y., Liu T., Xun H., Wu Y., Liu X., Zheng J., Hu F., Han S., Duan H., Chai J.",10.1021/acsami.4c06075,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Establishment And Characterization Of A Topotecan Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Nci-H460/Tpt10 Cell Line,"While topotecan (TPT) is a first- and second-line chemotherapeutic drug in treating lung cancer, the development of drug resistance in tumors still reserves as a major obstacle to chemotherapeutic success. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms of topotecan resistance is critical. In this study, the first topotecan-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, termed NCI-H460/TPT10, was established from the parental NCI-H460 cell line. NCI-H460/TPT10 cells exhibited a 394.7-fold resistance to TPT, and cross-resistance to SN-38, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin, compared to parental NCI-H460 cells. Overexpression of ABCG2 localized on the cell membrane, but not ABCB1 or ABCC1, was found in NCI-H460/TPT10 cells, indicating that ABCG2 was likely to be involved in topotecan-resistance. This was confirmed by the abolishment of drug resistance in NCI-H460/TPT10 cells after ABCG2 knockout. Moreover, the involvement of functional ABCG2 as a drug efflux pump conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) was indicated by low intracellular accumulation of TPT in NCI-H460/TPT10 cells, and the reversal effects by ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. The NCI-H460/TPT10 cell line and its parental cell line can be useful for drug screening and developing targeted strategies to overcome ABCG2-mediated MDR in NSCLC.","Lei Z.-N., Teng Q.-X., Zhang W., Fan Y.-F., Wang J.-Q., Cai C.-Y., Lu K.W., Yang D.-H., Wurpel J.N.D., Chen Z.-S.",10.3389/fcell.2020.607275,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology

In this review, we have summarized current knowledge on the relationship between tumor drug resistance and exosomes, and have discussed the potential applications of exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Zhong Y., Li H., Li P., Chen Y., Zhang M., Yuan Z., Zhang Y., Xu Z., Luo G., Fang Y., Li X.",10.3389/fonc.2021.743556,Frontiers In Oncology
Drug Resistance And Evolvability In An Emerging Human Fungal Pathogen,"Over the past decade, Candida auris has emerged as a highly transmissible human fungal pathogen. Because of its ability to transmit between patients in hospitals and its ability to rapidly develop drug resistance, C. auris presents unique challenges. However, at a genetic and genomic level we still understand relatively little about how drug resistance develops in this pathogen. Burrack et al. use experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations correlated with fluconazole resistance in C. auris. They identify interesting genomic features, including highly plastic subtelomeric regions and whole chromosomal and segmental aneuploidies. Excitingly, they also identify the first example of a hypermutator strain in C. auris. In comparison with the model human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, C. auris is more likely to undergo mutation and less likely to undergo copy number variation in response to drug selection, which may be linked to differences in base ploidy level.",Billmyre R.B.,10.1128/mbio.01876-22,Mbio
Dacomitinib Antagonizes Multidrug Resistance (Mdr) In Cancer Cells By Inhibiting The Efflux Activity Of Abcb1 And Abcg2 Transporters,"The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy remains a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. Numerous mechanisms have been recognized that cause MDR, but one of the most important mechanisms is overexpression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, through which the efflux of various anticancer drugs against their concentration gradients is powered by ATP. In recent years, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed for treatment in various human cancers overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). At the same time, some TKIs have been shown to be capable of inhibiting ABC transporter-mediated MDR. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a second generation, irreversible TKI, which has shown positive anticancer activities in some preclinical and clinical trials. As many TKIs are substrates or inhibitors of ABC transporters, this study investigates whether dacomitinib could interact with ABC subfamily members that mediate MDR, including ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCC1 (MRP1). The results showed that dacomitinib at 1.0 μM significantly reversed drug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2, but not ABCC1, doing so by antagonizing the drug efflux function in ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines. The reversal effect on ABCB1-overexpressing cells is more potent than that on ABCG2-overexpressing cells. In addition, dacomitinib at reversal concentration affected neither the protein expression level nor the localization of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Therefore, the mechanisms of this modulating effect are likely to be the following: first, as an inhibitor of ABCB1 or ABCG2 transporters, dacomitinib binds to drug-substrate site in transmembrane domains (TMD) stably in a noncompetitive manner; or second, dacomitinib inhibits ATPase activity and maintains the stability of TMD conformation in a concentration-dependent manner thereby inhibiting the drug efflux function of ABCB1 or ABCG2 transporter. This study provides a useful combinational therapeutic strategy with dacomitinib and substrates of ABCB1 and/or ABCG2 transporters in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cancers.","Fan Y.-F., Zhang W., Zeng L., Lei Z.-N., Cai C.-Y., Gupta P., Yang D.-H., Cui Q., Qin Z.-D., Chen Z.-S., Trombetta L.D.",10.1016/j.canlet.2018.01.021,Cancer Letters
Identifying The Pattern Characteristics Of Anoikis-Related Genes In Keloid,"Objective: Anoikis is a kind of programmed cell death that is triggered when cells lose contact with each other or with the matrix. However, the potential value of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in keloid (KD) has not been investigated. Approach: We downloaded three keloid fibroblast (KF) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and obtained 338 ARGs from a search of the GeneCards database and PubMed articles. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to construct the coexpression network and obtain the KF-related ARGs. The LASSO–Cox method was used to screen the hub ARGs and construct the best prediction model. Then, GEO single-cell sequencing datasets were used to verify the expression of hub genes. We used whole RNA-seq for gene-level validation and the correlation between KD immune infiltration and anoikis. Results: Our study comprehensively analyzed the role of ARGs in KD for the first time. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis identified six hub ARGs (HIF1A, SEMA7A, SESN1, CASP3, LAMA3, and SIK2). A large number of miRNAs participate in the regulation of hub ARGs. In addition, correlation analysis revealed that ARGs were significantly correlated with the infiltration levels of multiple immune cells in patients with KD. Innovation: We explored the expression characteristics of ARGs in KD, which is extremely important for determining the molecular pathways and mechanisms underlying KD. Conclusions: This study provides a useful reference for revealing the characteristics of ARGs in the pathogenesis of KD. The identified hub genes may provide potential therapeutic targets for patients. This study provides new ideas for individualized therapy and immunotherapy.","Xie R., Li C., Yun J., Zhang S., Zhong A., Cen Y., Li Z., Chen J.",10.1089/wound.2024.0027,Advances In Wound Care
Blue Light Potentiates Safety And Bactericidal Activity Of P-Toluquinone,"Fewer antibiotics are available for effective management of bacterial infections to date owing to increasing multiple-drug resistance (MDR). Here, we expand our early success in combination of 405 nm blue light irradiation with phenolic compounds to sufficiently kill blue light-refractory MDR Escherichia coli (E. coli). p-Toluquinone (p-TQ) alongside blue light inactivated 7.3 log(10) E. coli within 6 min, whereas either alone was totally ineffective. A similar killing efficacy was attained with four other pathogens commonly seen in hospital-acquired infections and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) that don't produce porphyrins-like molecules. The combinatory therapy prevented recurrence of E. coli infection in skin scratch wounds of murine. The bactericidal activity was ascribed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation triggered by blue light-mediated excitation of p-TQ, which is less likely to induce resistance because of multi-targeted and non-specific nature of ROS. Remarkably, toxic p-TQ became harmless to mammalian cells after brief exposure to blue light while retaining its bactericidal activity. The opposite effect of blue light on p-TQ activity unravels a novel, simple strategy to detoxify p-TQ and its combination with blue light as a safe and efficacious bactericidal modality for managing MDR bacterial infections.","Wang S., Wong K.I., Li Y., Ishii M., Li X., Wei L., Lu M., Wu M.X.",10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2022.112427,Journal Of Photochemistry And Photobiology B: Biology

Synthetic And Natural Rubber Associated Chemicals Drive Functional And Structural Changes As Well As Adaptations To Antibiotics In In Vitro Marine Microbiomes,"The leaching of additives from plastics and elastomers (rubbers) has raised concerns due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemicals extracted from two types of rubber on microbiomes derived from a benthic sea urchin and two pelagic fish species. Additionally, we examined whether bacterial communities preconditioned with rubber-associated chemicals displayed adaptations to antibiotics. At the highest tested concentrations of chemicals, we observed reduced maximum growth rates and yields, prolonged lag phases, and increased alpha diversity. While the effects on alpha and beta diversity were not always conclusive, several bacterial genera were significantly influenced by chemicals from the two rubber sources. Subsequent exposure of sea urchin microbiomes preconditioned with rubber chemicals to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin resulted in decreased maximum growth rates. This indicates a more sensitive microbiome to ciprofloxacin when preconditioned with rubber chemicals. Although no significant interaction effects between rubber chemicals and ciprofloxacin exposure were observed in bacterial alpha and beta diversity, we observed log-fold changes in two bacterial genera in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings highlight the structural and functional alterations in microbiomes originating from various marine species when exposed to rubber-associated chemicals and underscore the potential risks posed to marine life.","Carlsen E.C.L., Hjelset S., Gomes T., Igartua A., Sørensen L., Booth A.M., Hylland K., Eiler A.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116134,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety

Pilot Investigation On Biostability Of Drinking Water Distribution Systems Under Water Source Switching,"Abstract: Water quality deterioration of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) caused by water source switching has been reported previously. However, systematic investigation of the biostability of DWDS under water source switching is limited. Aged pipes, including three commonly used pipe materials dug out from a practical DWDS, were used to systematically investigate the biofilm stability mechanism of DWDS under water source switching to quality-improved water. An increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in the bulk water during the initial stage of the switching period was observed, indicating the risk of biofilm release through aged pipe surfaces after water source switching. Sloughing of biofilms might contribute to temporary instability. From day 35, the ATP concentration in the polyethylene (PE) and plastic stainless steel composite (PS) pipes were maintained at approximately 2.40 and 2.56 ng/L, respectively. In contrast, the ATP concentration in the ductile iron (DI) pipes was higher, at approximately 3.43 ng/L from day 42. The water quality variation could cause areas of the biofilm to slough and reduce the biomass of biofilm, causing partial alteration of the microbial community. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing–based functional prediction revealed that the biofilm could increase the abundance of chlorine-resistant bacteria attributed to the increase in Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium after switching to quality-improved water. Moreover, the profiles of specific pathways linked to human diseases, antibiotic resistance, and antibiotic biosynthesis revealed that the safety of the biofilm could improve after switching to quality-improved water. Key points: • The PE and PS biofilm showed improved resistance to water quality perturbation. • Greater number of Methylobacterium was found in the biofilm after water source switching. • 3.16S gene–based metagenomics prediction revealed that the safety of the biofilm under water source switching.

"Biofilm Of Petroleum-Based And Bio-Based Microplastics In Seawater In Response To Zn(Ii): Biofilm Formation, Community Structure, And Microbial Function","Microplastic biofilms are novel vectors for the transport and spread of pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria. With the increasing use of bio-based plastics, there is an urgent need to investigate the microbial colonization characteristics of these materials in seawater, particularly in comparison with conventional petroleum-based plastics. Furthermore, the effect of co-occurring contaminants, such as heavy metals, on the formation of microplastic biofilms and bacterial communities remains unclear. In this study, we compared the biofilm bacterial community structure of petroleum-based polyethylene (PE) and bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) in seawater under the influence of zinc ions (Zn(2+)). Our findings indicate that the biofilm on PLA microplastics in the late stage was impeded by the formation of a mildly acidic microenvironment resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester group on PLA. The PE surface had higher bacterial abundance and diversity, with a more intricate symbiotic pattern. The bacterial structures on the two types of microplastics were different; PE was more conducive to the colonization of anaerobic bacteria, whereas PLA was more favorable for the colonization of aerobic and acid-tolerant species. Furthermore, Zn increased the proportion of the dominant genera that could utilize microplastics as a carbon source, such as Alcanivorax and Nitratireductor. PLA had a greater propensity to harbor and disseminate pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria, and Zn promoted the enrichment and spread of harmful bacteria such as, Pseudomonas and Clostridioides. Therefore, further research is essential to fully understand the potential environmental effects of bio-based microplastics and the role of heavy metals in the dynamics of bacterial colonization.","Chu W.-C., Gao Y.-Y., Wu Y.-X., Liu F.-F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172397,Science Of The Total Environment
Towards Quantifying Plasmid Similarity,"Plasmids are extrachromosomal replicons which can quickly spread resistance and virulence genes between clinical pathogens. From the tens of thousands of currently available plasmid sequences we know that overall plasmid diversity is structured, with related plasmids sharing a largely conserved ‘backbone’ of genes while being able to carry very different genetic cargo. Moreover, plasmid genomes can be structurally plastic and undergo frequent rearrangements. So, how can we quantify plasmid similarity? Answering this question requires practical efforts to sample natural variation as well as theoretical considerations of what defines a group of related plasmids. Here we consider the challenges of analysing and rationalising the current plasmid data deluge to define appropriate similarity thresholds.","Matlock W., Shaw L.P., Sheppard S.K., Feil E.",10.1099/mgen.0.001290,Microbial Genomics
Platinum Sensitivity Of Ovarian Cancer Cells Does Not Influence Their Ability To Induce M2-Type Macrophage Polarization,"Problem: Development of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer is mediated by both cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition program in cancer cells may lead to enrichment for resistant clones. These processes can be affected by tumor-associated macrophages, a highly plastic population of cells that participate in tumor progression and response to treatment by shaping the microenvironment. We aimed to study how platinum resistance influences the crosstalk between macrophages and ovarian cancer cells. Method of study: Using cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line A2780, we developed and characterized cisplatin-resistant A2780Cis and cisplatin and doxorubicin co-resistant A2780Dox cell lines. Next, we set up an indirect coculture system with THP-1 cell line-derived M0-type-, M1-type- and M2-type-like polarized macrophages. We monitored the expression of genes associated with cellular stemness, multidrug resistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, and expression profile of M1/M2 markers in macrophages. Results: Development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines was accompanied by increased migration, clonogenicity, and upregulated expression of transcription factors, associated with cellular stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Upon coculture, we noted that the most relevant changes in gene expression profile occurred in A2780 cells. Moreover, M0- and M1-type macrophages, but not M2-type macrophages, showed significant transcriptional alterations. Conclusion: Our results provide the evidence for bidirectional interplay between cancer cells and macrophages. Independent of platinum resistance status, ovarian cancer cells polarize macrophages toward M2-like type, whereas macrophages induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness-related gene expression profile in cisplatin-sensitive, but not cisplatin-resistant cancer cells.","Mlynska A., Povilaityte E., Zemleckaite I., Zilionyte K., Strioga M., Krasko J., Dobrovolskiene N., Peng M.-W., Intaite B., Pasukoniene V.",10.1111/aji.12996,American Journal Of Reproductive Immunology
Redox Active Zn@Mofs As Spontaneous Reactive Oxygen Species Releasing Antimicrobials,"The rapid development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among infectious pathogens has become a major threat and challenge in healthcare systems globally. A strategy distinct from minimizing the overuse of antimicrobials involves the development of novel antimicrobials with a mode of action that prevents the development of AMR microbial strains. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed as a natural byproduct of the cellular aerobic metabolism. However, it becomes pathological when ROS is produced at excessive levels. Exploiting this phenomenon, research on redox-active bactericides has been demonstrated to be beneficial. Materials that release ROS via photodynamic, thermodynamic, and photocatalytic interventions have been developed as nanomedicines and are used in various applications. However, these materials require external stimuli for ROS release to be effective as biocides. In this paper, we report novel zinc-based metal organic framework (Zn@MOF) particles that promote the spontaneous release of active ROS species. The synthesized Zn@MOF spontaneously releases superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, exhibiting a potent antimicrobial efficacy against various microbes. Zn@MOF-incorporated plastic films and coatings show excellent, long-lasting antimicrobial potency even under continuous microbial challenge and an aging process. These disinfecting surfaces maintain their antimicrobial properties even after 500× surface wipes. Zn@MOF is also biocompatible and safe on the skin, illustrating its broad potential applications in medical technology and consumer care applications.","Wang J., Teong S.P., Riduan S.N., Armugam A., Lu H., Gao S., Yean Y.K., Ying J.Y., Zhang Y.",10.1021/jacs.3c10411,Journal Of The American Chemical Society

Effects Of Microplastics On Dissipation Of Oxytetracycline And Its Relevant Resistance Genes In Soil Without And With Serratia Marcescens: Comparison Between Biodegradable And Conventional Microplastics,"The biodegradable (polybutylene adipate terephthalate: PBAT) and conventional (polyethylene: PE) microplastics (MPs) at 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % dosages (w/w) were added into soils with and without Serratia marcescens ZY01 (ZY01, a tet-host strain) to understand their different effects on the dissipation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and tet. The results showed that the dosages of PBAT MP exhibited different inhibition degrees of OTC biodegradation in soils regardless of ZY01, while the dosages of PE MP did not change the enhancement degree of OTC biodegradation in soils without ZY01. These differences were due to the higher adsorption capacity of OTC on PBAT MP and the stronger toxicity of PBAT MP to microorganisms. Besides soil organic matter, pH and total phosphorus were important factors regulating specific tet-host bacteria in soils with MPs (e.g., the nitrogen-cycling bacteria Steroidobacter and Nitrospira) and MPs + ZY01 (e.g., the phosphorus-cycling bacteria Saccharimonadales and Haliangium), respectively. Regardless of ZY01, a stronger selective harboring of tet-host bacteria in PE MP treatments than PBAT MP treatments was observed at the MP dosage of 1 % (w/w), while the opposite trend was true at the MP dosages of 0.5 % and 2 % (w/w). Some specific genera belonging to Actinobacteriota strongly associated with the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), playing a critical role in the horizontal gene transfer of tet in soils especially for the co-existence of MPs and ZY01. This study will be helpful for understanding on how biodegradable and conventional MPs as hotspots affect the environmental behavior of antibiotics and ARGs in soil.","Zhang G., Ren R., Yan X., Zhang H., Zhu Y.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117235,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
"Contamination Sources, Biofilm-Forming Ability And Biocide Resistance Of Staphylococcus Aureus In Tilapia-Processing Facilities","The major contamination sources, biofilm-forming ability and biocide resistance of Staphylococcus aureus in tilapia-processing plants were evaluated. Twenty-five processing control points were analysed twice in two factories, including whole tilapias, frozen fillets, water and food-contact surfaces. No final product was contaminated with S. aureus. However, high concentrations of S. aureus carrying enterotoxin ( se) genes were found in several processing points of both factories due to the application of inadequate hygienic and handling procedures, which generate a high risk of cross-contamination of the tilapia fillets with staphylococcal enterotoxins. Nine S. aureus strains were characterized by RAPD-PCR using primers AP-7, ERIC-2 and S. A wide diversity of se gene profiles was detected, most strains being multi- se-carriers. All S. aureus strains showed high biofilm-forming ability on stainless steel and polystyrene. Biofilm-forming ability was correlated with the presence of fliC H7 and the type of origin surface (metallic or plastic). A marked resistance of S. aureus to peracetic acid and sodium hypochlorite was also observed, required doses being higher than those recommended by manufacturers to be eradicated. Case-by-case approaches are thus recommended to determine the sources and degree of contamination present in each factory, which would allow applying precise responses that avoid, or at least reduce, the presence of bacterial pathogens and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.","Vázquez-Sánchez D., Galvão J.A., Oetterer M.",10.1177/1082013217742753,Food Science And Technology International = Ciencia Y Tecnologia De Los Alimentos Internacional
Herbal Products-Powered Thermosensitive Hydrogel With Phototherapy And Microenvironment Reconstruction For Accelerating Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria-Infected Wound Healing,"Wound healing and infection remain significant challenges due to the ineffectiveness against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and the complex oxidative wound microenvironments. To address these issues, thymoquinone-reinforced injectable and thermosensitive TQ@PEG-PAF-Cur hydrogels with dual functions of microenvironment reshaping and photodynamic therapy are developed. The hydrogel comprises natural compound thymoquinone (TQ) and poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (alanine-co-phenyl alanine) copolymers (PEG-PAF) conjugated with natural photosensitizer curcumin (Cur). The incorporation of TQ and Cur reduces the sol-to-gel transition temperature of TQ@PEG-PAF-Cur to 30°C, compared to PEG-PAF hydrogel (37°C), due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonding, matching the wound microenvironment temperature. Under blue light excitation, TQ@PEG-PAF-Cur generates significant amounts of reactive oxygen species such as H(2)O(2), 1O(2), and ·OH, exhibiting rapid and efficient bactericidal capacities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and broad spectrum β-lactamases Escherichia coli via photodynamic therapy (PDT). Additionally, Cur effectively inhibits the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines in skin tissue-forming cells. As a result, the composite hydrogel can rapidly transform into a gel to cover the wound, reshape the wound microenvironment, and accelerate wound healing in vivo. This collaborative antibacterial strategy provides valuable insights to guide the development of multifunctional materials for efficient wound healing.","Zhao G., Lu G., Fan H., Wei L., Yu Q., Li M., Li H., Yu N., Wang S., Lu M.",10.1002/adhm.202400049,Advanced Healthcare Materials
Bacteriological Investigation And Drug Resistance Analysis Of Chronic Refractory Wound Secretions,"BACKGROUND: Chronic refractory wounds were common and the treatments were complicated for burn and plastic surgeons. This study was to investigate the bacterial distribution characteristics and bacterial drug resistance of chronic refractory wound secretions. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 425 patients with chronic refractory wound infection. The results of bacterial culture of wound secretions and drug sensitivity test were retrospectively analyzed. Further, the location area of the wound was divided into 4 regions, and the difference of the bacterial culture results between different regions was analyzed. RESULTS: The wound secretions were cultured into 401 bacterial strains, including 206 gram-positive bacteria strains, accounting for 51.4%, with the highest detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus at 26.2% (105/401). There were 195 gram-negative bacteria strains, accounting for 48.6%, with the highest detection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 14.2% (57/401). There were 6 fungal strains. The proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the III region of the wound zone was significantly greater than that in the other 3 regions. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria of chronic refractory wound secretions is not much different. However, in the area close to the perineum (III region), gram-negative bacteria is significantly higher, which has a certain reference value for the use of antibiotics in clinical practice.Level 4.","Dong X.-M., Pei L.-L., Lu P.-S., Ni P., Yu B.-F., Fan Z.-Q.",10.1097/SCS.0000000000008473,The Journal Of Craniofacial Surgery
Metagenomic Analysis Explores The Interaction Of Aged Microplastics And Roxithromycin On Gut Microbiota And Antibiotic Resistance Genes Of Carassius Auratus,"The aging process changes the physicochemical structure of microplastics and affects environmental behaviors and toxicological effects of coexisting pollutants, thereby posing ecological risks. In this study, the effects of aged polystyrene microplastics alone or in combination with the 100 μg/L roxithromycin (ROX) on intestines of Carassius auratus were investigated. The carrier effect of microplastics was enhanced by aging due to changes in functional groups and surface area, which led to an increase in the bioaccumulation of ROX. The combined exposure of aged microplastics (APS) and ROX caused more inflammatory cell infiltration and cilia defects, and significantly inhibited the activity of amylase and lipase. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the combined exposure of microplastics and ROX increased the abundance of Gemmobacter, Bosea, Rhizobium, and Shinella and decreased the abundance of Cetobacterium and Akkermansia (p < 0.05). The presence of APS enhanced the selective enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes. What's more, the influence of microplastics and antibiotics on gut microbiota was closely related to carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism activities, as well as the abundance of baca and sul1 resistance genes. These results expand our understanding of the interaction mechanism between APS and antibiotics in real aquatic environment.","Zhang P., Lu G., Sun Y., Yan Z., Dang T., Liu J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127773,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Overexpression Of Abcc1 And Abcg2 Confers Resistance To Talazoparib, A Poly (Adp-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor","Aims: The overexpression of ABC transporters on cancer cell membranes is one of the most common causes of multidrug resistance (MDR). This study investigates the impact of ABCC1 and ABCG2 on the resistance to talazoparib (BMN-673), a potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in ovarian cancer treatment. Methods: The cell viability test was used to indicate the effect of talazoparib in different cell lines. Computational molecular docking analysis was conducted to simulate the interaction between talazoparib and ABCC1 or ABCG2. The mechanism of talazoparib resistance was investigated by constructing talazoparib-resistant subline A2780/T4 from A2780 through drug selection with gradually increasing talazoparib concentration. Results: Talazoparib cytotoxicity decreased in drug-selected or gene-transfected cell lines overexpressing ABCC1 or ABCG2 but can be restored by ABCC1 or ABCG2 inhibitors. Talazoparib competitively inhibited substrate drug efflux activity of ABCC1 or ABCG2. Upregulated ABCC1 and ABCG2 protein expression on the plasma membrane of A2780/T4 cells enhances resistance to other substrate drugs, which could be overcome by the knockout of either gene. In vivo experiments confirmed the retention of drug-resistant characteristics in tumor xenograft mouse models. Conclusions: The therapeutic efficacy of talazoparib in cancer may be compromised by its susceptibility to MDR, which is attributed to its interactions with the ABCC1 or ABCG2 transporters. The overexpression of these transporters can potentially diminish the therapeutic impact of talazoparib in cancer treatment.","Teng Q.-X., Lei Z.-N., Wang J.-Q., Yang Y., Wu Z.-X., Acharekar N.D., Zhang W., Yoganathan S., Pan Y., Wurpel J., Chen Z.-S., Fang S.",10.1016/j.drup.2023.101028,Drug Resistance Updates
Original Article Integrative Analysis Of Autophagy-Related Genes Reveals That Capns1 Is A Novel Prognostic Biomarker And Promotes The Malignancy Of Melanoma Via Notch Signaling Pathway,"Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly fatal form of skin cancer that develops from the malignant transformation of epidermal melanocytes. There is substantial evidence linking autophagy to cancer etiology and immunotherapy efficacy. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) using TCGA datasets and further explore the potential function of critical ARGs in SKCM progression. We performed comprehensive bioinformatics analysis uses the TCGA dataset. RT-PCR was applied to examine the expression of CAPNS1 in SKCM cells. Lost-of-function experiments were performed to detect the expression of the related proteins. In this search, we screed 70 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DE-ARGs), including 33 up-DE-ARGs and 37 down-DE-ARGs. Enrichment assays revealed that these 70 DE-ARGs may exert influence on critical cellular processes such as autophagy, protein kinase activity, and signaling pathways, impacting cell growth, differentiation, survival, and tumor development. Then, we further explore the prognostic value of 70 DE-ARGs and confirmed 18 survival-related DE-ARGs in SKCM patients. Nearly all the 18 DE-ARGs’ methylation was negatively correlated with their corresponding expression in SKCM. The 12 survival-related DE-ARGs were used to develop a unique predictive model that effectively classified SKCM patients into high- and low-risk groups with regard to overall survival. Furthermore, tumor environment analysis indicated that the risk score was associated with several immune cells. Among the 12 survival-related DE-ARGs, our attention focused on CAPNS1 which was highly expressed in SKCM patients and predicted a poor prognosis. In addition, we confirmed that knockdown of CAPNS1 distinctly suppressed the proliferation, metastasis and EMT of SKCM cells, and promoted autophagy via regulating Notch signaling pathway. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the intricate molecular landscape of SKCM progression and presents promising avenues for future research and clinical applications.","Gao M., Liu J., Yang M., Zhang X., Zhang Y., Zhou Z., Deng J.",10.62347/ECDF2762,American Journal Of Cancer Research
Increased Drug Resistance Of Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Biofilms Formed On A Mouse Dermal Chip Model,"Purpose. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm formation in humans is of serious clinical concern. Previous in vitro studies have been performed with biofilms grown only on inorganic substrates; therefore, we investigated the vancomycin (VCM) resistance of MRSA biofilms grown on skin tissue. Methodology. We established a novel tissue substrate model, namely MRSA grown on segments of mouse skin tissue (dermal chips, DCs), and compared its resistance capacity against VCM with that of MRSA biofilms grown on plastic chips (PCs). Results/Key findings. For one MRSA isolate, we found that the VCM MIC was identical (1.56 μg ml(-1)) for planktonic cultures and for biofilms-formed on PCs (PC-BF), although the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) increased to 6.25 μg ml(-1) in PC-BF. On the contrary, the MIC and MBC for biofilms formed on DCs (DC-BF) significantly increased (25 and 50 μg ml(-1), respectively). Furthermore, the minimum biofilm-eradicating concentration was higher for DC-BF (100 μg ml(-1)) than for PCBF (25 μg ml(-1)). Using six MRSA strains, we found that in PC-BF, the c.f.u. number decreased with increasing VCM concentration, whereas in DC-BF, it greatly increased until the MIC was reached, accompanied by the formation of large colonies, thicker bacterial walls and the presence of many mitotic cells. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the VCM resistance of MRSA was greater in DC-BF. We conclude that DCs may provide a specific environment for MRSA that enhances bacterial growth under cytotoxic VCM concentrations, and might be useful for the study of skin wound infections and the effects of antimicrobial drugs.","Jimi S., Miyazaki M., Takata T., Ohjimi H., Akita S., Hara S.",10.1099/jmm.0.000461,Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecule-2 (Corm-2) Inhibits Growth Of Multidrug-Resistant Uropathogenic Escherichia Coli In Biofilm And Following Host Cell Colonization,"Background: Increased resistance to antimicrobial agents is a characteristic of many bacteria growing in biofilms on for example indwelling urinary catheters or in intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Biofilm-related infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are a major challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate if a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-2) has antibacterial effects against ESBL-producing uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in the biofilm mode of growth and following colonization of host bladder epithelial cells. Results: The effect of CORM-2 was examined on bacteria grown within an established biofilm (biofilm formed for 24 h on plastic surface) by a live/dead viability staining assay. CORM-2 (500 μM) exposure for 24 h killed approximately 60 % of the ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. A non-ESBL-producing UPEC isolate and the E. coli K-12 strain TG1 were also sensitive to CORM-2 exposure when grown in biofilms. The antibacterial effect of CORM-2 on planktonic bacteria was reduced and delayed in the stationary growth phase compared to the exponential growth phase. In human bladder epithelial cell colonization experiments, CORM-2 exposure for 4 h significantly reduced the bacterial counts of an ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. Conclusion: This study shows that CORM-2 has antibacterial properties against multidrug-resistant UPEC under biofilm-like conditions and following host cell colonization, which motivate further studies of its therapeutic potential.","Sahlberg Bang C., Kruse R., Johansson K., Persson K.",10.1186/s12866-016-0678-7,Bmc Microbiology
Selective Covid-19 Coinfections In Diabetic Patients With Concomitant Cardiovascular Comorbidities Are Associated With Increased Mortality,"Coinfections and comorbidities add additional layers of difficulties into the challenges of COVID-19 patient management strategies. However, studies examining these clinical conditions are limited. We have independently investigated the significance of associations of specific bacterial species and different comorbidities in the outcome and case fatality rates among 129 hospitalized comorbid COVID-19 patients. For the first time, to best of our knowledge, we report on the predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii in COVID-19 non-survival diabetic patients The two species were significantly associated to COVID-19 case fatality rates (p-value = 0.02186). Coinfection rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii in non-survivors were 93% and 73%, respectively. Based on standard definitions for antimicrobial resistance, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii were classified as multidrug resistant and extremely drug resistant, respectively. All patients died at ICU with similar clinical characterisitics. Of the 28 major coinfections, 24 (85.7%) were in non-survivor diabetic patients, implying aggravating and worsening the course of COVID-19. The rates of other comorbidities varied: asthma (47%), hypertension (79.4%), ischemic heart disease (71%), chronic kidney disease (35%), and chronic liver disease (32%); however, the rates were higher in K. pneumoniae and were all concomitantly associated to diabetes. Other bacterial species and comorbidities did not have significant correlation to the outcomes. These findings have highly significant clinical implications in the treatment strategies of COVID-19 patients. Future vertical genomic studies would reveal more insights into the molecular and immunological mechanisms of these frequent bacterial species. Future large cohort multicenter studies would reveal more insights into the mechanisms of infection in COVID-19.","Said K.B., Alsolami A., Alshammari F., Alreshidi F.S., Fathuldeen A., Alrashid F., Bashir A.I., Osman S., Aboras R., Alshammari A., Alshammari T., Alharbi S.F.",10.3390/pathogens11050508,Pathogens
Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing For The Identification Of Infections Caused By Gram-Negative Pathogens And The Prediction Of Antimicrobial Resistance,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the identification of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) infections and the prediction of antimicrobial resistance. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 182 patients with diagnosis of GNB infections who underwent mNGS and conventional microbiological tests (CMTs). Results: The detection rate of mNGS was 96.15%, higher than CMTs (45.05%) with a significant difference (χ(2) = 114.46, P < .01). The pathogen spectrum identified by mNGS was significantly wider than CMTs. Interestingly, the detection rate of mNGS was substantially higher than that of CMTs (70.33% vs 23.08%, P < .01) in patients with but not without antibiotic exposure. There was a significant positive correlation between mapped reads and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and interleukin-8). However, mNGS failed to predict antimicrobial resistance in 5 of 12 patients compared to phenotype antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Conclusions: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has a higher detection rate, a wider pathogen spectrum, and is less affected by prior antibiotic exposure than CMTs in identifying Gram-negative pathogens. The mapped reads may reflect a pro-inflammatory state in GNB-infected patients. Inferring actual resistance phenotypes from metagenomic data remains a great challenge.","Xiao Y.-H., Luo Z.-X., Wu H.-W., Xu D.-R., Zhao R.",10.1093/labmed/lmad039,Lab Medicine
Nanoemulsion As An Effective Inhibitor Of Biofilm-Forming Bacterial Associated Drug Resistance: An Insight Into Covid Based Nosocomial Infections,"Antibiotic overuse has resulted in the microevolution of drug-tolerant bacteria. Understandably it has become one of the most significant obstacles of the current century for scientists and researchers to overcome. Bacteria have a tendency to form biofilm as a survival mechanism. Biofilm producing microorganism become far more resistant to antimicrobial agents and their tolerance to drugs also increases. Prevention of biofilm development and curbing the virulency factors of these multi drug resistant or tolerant bacterial pathogens is a newly recognised tactic for overcoming the challenges associated with such bacterial infections and has become a niche to be addressed. In order to inhibit virulence and biofilm from planktonic bacteria such as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and others, stable nanoemulsions (NEs) of essential oils (EOs) and their bioactive compounds prove to be an interesting solution. These NEs demonstrated significantly greater anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activity than commercial antibiotics. The EO reduces disease-causing gene expression, which is required for pathogenicity, biofilm formation and attachment to the surfaces. Essential NE and NE-loaded hydrogel surface coatings demonstrates superior antibiofilm activity which can be employed in healthcare-related equipments like glass, plastic, and metal chairs, hospital beds, ventilators, catheters, and tools used in intensive care units. Thus, anti-virulence and anti-biofilm forming strategies based on NEs-loaded hydrogel may be used as coatings to combat biofilm-mediated infection on solid surfaces.","Raj D.S., Dhamodharan D., Thanigaivel S., Vickram A.S., Byun H.-S.",10.1007/s12257-022-0055-3,Biotechnology And Bioprocess Engineering

Plastic litter in the sea contains an autochthonous microbiota that is different from that of the surrounding seawater and sediment. Vibrio abundance was higher on plastic litter than in surrounding seawater and sediment.

Efficacy Of 24 Hours Versus 5 Days Of Prophylactic Antibiotics For The Prevention Of Surgical Site Infection In Outpatient Elective Facial Plastic Surgery,"Background: The discovery of penicillin marked a paradigm shift in medicine with the ability to treat previously life-threatening infections. Increasing antibiotic resistance as well as the risk of adverse reactions to antibiotics, however, creates pressures for judicious use. There continues to be debate about the role of prophylactic antibiotics in facial plastic surgery. This study explores the role of prophylactic antibiotic administration in elective outpatient facial plastic surgery by comparing 5 days versus 24 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis. Method: A retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing cosmetic procedures at an outpatient facial plastic surgical center who received either 5 days or 24 hours of prophylactic antibiotics was performed. The primary outcome was the need for postoperative antibiotics within 6 weeks of surgery. Results: 204 patients met the inclusion criteria: 104 in the 5-day group and 100 in the 24-hour prophylaxis group. The overall infection rate was 3.4%: 3% in the 24-hour group and 3.8% in the 5-day group (p = 0.77). Subgroup analysis of clean-contaminated cases (n = 85) showed the rate of postoperative infections was 4.3%, all within the 5-day group. In clean cases (n = 119), the rate of postoperative infections was 4.2% (n = 5): 4.8% (n = 3) in the 24-hour group versus 3.5% (n = 2) in the 5-day group. Conclusions: The results show that decreasing the duration of antibiotics was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection. Given that antibiotics are an increasingly precious commodity with rising rates of resistance, this study supports the use of decreasing postoperative antibiotics to 24 hours.","Toman J., Zachary Porterfield J., Randall M.W., Kumar A., Farrior E.H.",10.1016/j.jpra.2024.01.016,Jpras Open
Gauze Impregnated With Quaternary Ammonium Salt Reduces Bacterial Colonization Of Surgical Drains After Breast Reconstruction,"Surgical site infection after breast reconstruction is associated with increased length of hospital stay, readmission rates, cost, morbidity, and mortality. Identifying methods to reduce surgical site infection without the use of antibiotics may be beneficial at reducing antimicrobial resistance, reserving the use of antibiotics for more severe cases. Quaternary ammonium salts have previously been shown to be a safe and effective antimicrobial agent in the setting of in vitro and in vivo animal experiments. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial properties of a quaternary ammonium salt, 3-trimethoxysilyl propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (QAS-3PAC; Bio-spear), at reducing surgical drain site colonization and infection after breast reconstruction (deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstruction or tissue expander placement). Twenty patients were enrolled, with 14 surgical drains covered with nonimpregnated gauze and 17 surgical drains covered with QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze, for the purposes of investigating bacterial colonization. Antibiotic sensitivity analysis was also conducted when bacterial cultures were positive. The overall incidence of bacterial colonization of surgical drains was lower in the treatment group compared with the control group (17.6% vs 64.3%, respectively; P = 0.008). QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze reduced the incidence of bacterial colonization of surgical drains during the first (0.0% vs 33.3%) and second (33.3% vs 87.5%; P = 0.04) postoperative week. Furthermore, no enhanced antibiotic resistance was noted on drains treated with QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze. The results of this study suggest that QAS-3PAC impregnated gauze applied over surgical drains may be an effective method for reducing the incidence of bacterial colonization.","Strong A.L., Wolfe E.T., Shank N., Chaffin A.E., Jansen D.A.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000001420,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
"Review Of Emerging Contaminants In Green Stormwater Infrastructure: Antibiotic Resistance Genes, Microplastics, Tire Wear Particles, Pfas, And Temperature","Green stormwater infrastructure is a growing management approach to capturing, infiltrating, and treating runoff at the source. However, there are several emerging contaminants for which green stormwater infrastructure has not been explicitly designed to mitigate and for which removal mechanisms are not yet well defined. This is an issue, as there is a growing understanding of the impact of emerging contaminants on human and environmental health. This paper presents a review of five emerging contaminants – antibiotic resistance genes, microplastics, tire wear particles, PFAS, and temperature – and seeks to improve our understanding of how green stormwater infrastructure is impacted by and can be designed to mitigate these emerging contaminants. To do so, we present a review of the source and transport of these contaminants to green stormwater infrastructure, specific treatment mechanisms within green infrastructure, and design considerations of green stormwater infrastructure that could lead to their removal. In addition, common removal mechanisms across these contaminants and limitations of green infrastructure for contaminant mitigation are discussed. Finally, we present future research directions that can help to advance the use of green infrastructure as a first line of defense for downstream water bodies against emerging contaminants of concern.","Bodus B., O'Malley K., Dieter G., Gunawardana C., Mcdonald W.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167195,Science Of The Total Environment
"Use Of Perioperative Prophylactic Antibiotics Following Excision Of Ulcerated Skin Lesions In The Uk: A National, Multispeciality Survey Of Clinicians","Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the UK, and up to a third of lesions are ulcerated at the time of excision. Ulceration has been shown to increase the risk of developing surgical site infection following excision, with some studies finding infection rates of 33%. However, no specific guidelines for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in such cases exist. We surveyed 129 clinicians (covering Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery, and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery) who all excise skin lesions on a regular basis. There was significant variability in their practice with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, with 9% always prescribing them and 19% never prescribing them. Variation exists both among and between specialities. This variation increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and shows a paucity of good clinical evidence, indicating that a well-designed clinical trial is needed to guide future practice.","Totty J.P., Matin R.N., Wernham A., Ray R., Thomas-Jones E., Abbott R.A.",10.1111/ced.15075,Clinical And Experimental Dermatology
Infection Of A Venous Port-Beware Of The Mycobacterium,"An 84-year-old female with metastatic left breast cancer underwent a venous port insertion for chemotherapy. The port was inserted using standard techniques with image guidance under local anesthesia. She presented after 36 days with evidence of infection. A limited bedside ultrasound demonstrated free fluid surrounding the port. The port was subsequently removed the same day, at which time pus was expressed from the subcutaneous pocket. The culture from the pus grew Mycobacterium abscessus. She required removal of the port and wound debridement, wound dressings and a prolonged course of antibiotics. Mycobacterium abscessus is a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant, non-tuberculous mycobacteria that are also relatively resistant to standard skin disinfectants. In recent years, this organism has been increasingly reported as the culprit in post-operative or post-procedural infections. Treatment is challenging due to multidrug resistance, and requires an extensive course of intravenous antimicrobial and macrolide-based combination therapy followed by oral antimicrobial therapy. Early treatment is essential as progression may result in disseminated infection. We discuss the peri-operative and post-operative care required in preventing and treating infection with this organism.","Heng T.H., Loh M.H.Y., Chua Y.Y., Tan B.K., Tan B.S.",10.3941/jrcr.v16i9.4587,Journal Of Radiology Case Reports
Transcriptional Activity Of Detoxification Genes Is Altered By Ultraviolet Filters In Chironomus Riparius,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters are compounds used to prevent the damage produced by UV radiation in personal care products, plastics, etc. They have been associated with endocrine disruption, showing anti-estrogen activity in vertebrates and altering the ecdysone pathway in invertebrates. Although they have attracted the attention of multiple research teams there is a lack of data about how animals activate detoxification systems, especially in invertebrates. Here, analysis of the effects of two UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), on the transcriptional activity of nine genes covering the three steps of the detoxification process has been performed. Four cytochrome P450 genes belonging to different members of this family, five GST genes, and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) gene were studied by RT-PCR to analyze their transcriptional activity in fourth instar larvae exposed to the UV filters for 8 and 24 h. The obtained results show a differential response with downregulation of the different Cyp450s tested by 4MBC while BP3 seems not to modify their expression. On the other hand, some of the GST genes were affected by one or other of the filters, showing a less homogenous response. Finally, MRP1 was activated by both filters but at different times. These results demonstrate for first time that UV filters alter the expression of genes involved in the different steps of the detoxification process and that they can be processed by phase I enzymes other than Cyp450s. They also suggest that UV filters affect biotransformation processes, compromising the ability of the individual to respond to chemical stress, so further research is needed to know the extent of the damage that they can produce in the resistance of the cell to chemicals.",Martínez-Guitarte J.-L.,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.11.017,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
"What Should Be The Antibiotic Prescription Protocol For Burn Patients Admitted In The Department Of Burns, Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery","This is a prospective study with the aim to determine specific patterns of burn wound bacterial colonisation and antimicrobial resistance profiles. There is a high incidence of infections and septicaemia in post-burn patients, which, in turn, are associated with high morbidity and mortality, a fact that compelled us to undertake this study. The study was conducted over a period 11 months, from 1 August 2014 to 30 June 2015, in 50 burn patients admitted in our burn unit. Wound cultures were taken after 72 hours of admission from all the patients, and then, empirical systemic antibiotics were administered. For wound cultures; 1 cubic cm tissue was taken and placed in aerobic and anaerobic culture vials and transported to the microbiology lab under all aseptic precautions as soon as possible. At the time of fever any time after 72 hours of admission, 16 ml of blood was drawn under all aseptic precautions. Both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vials were filled with 8 ml of blood each and transported to the microbiology lab. The results of culture and sensitivity reports of 50 patients were recorded. The data obtained was analysed using appropriate statistical analytical tests. The most common organism responsible for bacteraemia is Pseudomonas (43%). Most of the strains of organisms isolated were resistant to commonly used antibiotics in the hospital; Pseudomonas was found 100% resistant to a combination of ampicillin + sulbactum, ceftriaxone and was most often sensitive to imipenem, amikacin and vancomycin. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was also found resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ceftriaxone, ampicillin + sulbactum and ceftazidime + calvulanic acid. Linzolid and vancomycin were effective in 83% and 100% cases, respectively. We conclude that similar institution-specific studies should be conducted, and such studies will be helpful in providing useful guidelines for choosing effective empirical therapy that will have a great impact on the prevention of infection and its complications in burn patients because of bacteraemia.","Mir M.A., Khurram M.F., Khan A.H.",10.1111/iwj.12588,International Wound Journal
"Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Prevalence, Antibiotic Resistance And Antimicrobial Use In Chinese Burn Wards From 2007 To 2014","Objective: To assess the application of antibacterial agents, alongside pathogen prevalence and Pseudomonas aeruginosa drug resistance, with the aim of understanding the impact of inappropriate antibacterial use. Methods: This retrospective study assessed bacteria from wounds, catheters, blood, faeces, urine and sputum of hospitalized patients in burn wards between 2007 and 2014. The intensity of use of antibacterial agents and resistance of P. aeruginosa to common anti-Gram-negative antibiotics were measured. Results: Annual detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus were significantly decreased, whereas annual detection rates of P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were significantly increased. Multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were increased. The intensity of use of some anti-Gramnegative antibiotics positively correlated with resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to similar antimicrobials. Conclusion: In burn wards, more attention should be paid to P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. The use of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam should be limited to counter the related increase in resistance levels.","Dou Y., Huan J., Guo F., Zhou Z., Shi Y.",10.1177/0300060517703573,Journal Of International Medical Research
Using Colistin As A Trojan Horse: Inactivation Of Gram-Negative Bacteria With Chlorophyllin,"Colistin (polymyxin E) is a membrane-destabilizing antibiotic used against Gram-negative bacteria. We have recently reported that the outer membrane prevents the uptake of antibacterial chlorophyllin into Gram-negative cells. In this study, we used sub-toxic concentrations of colistin to weaken this barrier for a combination treatment of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with chlorophyllin. In the presence of 0.25 µg/mL colistin, chlorophyllin was able to inactivate both bacteria strains at concentrations of 5-10 mg/L for E. coli and 0.5-1 mg/L for S. Typhimurium, which showed a higher overall susceptibility to chlorophyllin treatment. In accordance with a previous study, chlorophyllin has proven antibacterial activity both as a photosensitizer, illuminated with 12 mW/cm(2), and in darkness. Our data clearly confirmed the relevance of the outer membrane in protection against xenobiotics. Combination treatment with colistin broadens chlorophyllin’s application spectrum against Gram-negatives and gives rise to the assumption that chlorophyllin together with cell membrane-destabilizing substances may become a promising approach in bacteria control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that colistin acts as a door opener even for the photodynamic inactivation of colistin-resistant (mcr-1-positive) E. coli cells by chlorophyllin, which could help us to overcome this antimicrobial resistance.","Richter P., Krüger M., Prasad B., Gastiger S., Bodenschatz M., Wieder F., Burkovski A., Geißdörfer W., Lebert M., Strauch S.M.",10.3390/antibiotics8040158,Antibiotics
Infections Following Stingray Attacks: A Case Series And Literature Review Of Antimicrobial Resistance And Treatment,"Background: Injuries sustained following stingray attacks are at high risk of infection and can progress to serious, debilitating consequences for the patient if not appropriately addressed. Antibiotic treatment of such infections is important to minimise the morbidity experienced by patients. However, antibiotic guidelines relating specific to this patient group are not well established. This study aims to report the experience of a single institution at treating stingray associated wound infections and to review the literature for reported cases. Additionally, we review the microbiological risk in these patients and summarise the literature surrounding antibiotic choice. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients presenting with injuries sustained following stingray attacks was conducted at a single institution. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify cases of infected stingray associated trauma and review the causative micro-organisms and antibiotics used to treat such infections. Results: 22 cases of stingray injuries were identified from a single institution. Of these, eight infections were reported. One case grew a highly resistant Vibrio species. Among the literature, 18 cases of infections were identified many of which led to significant complications for patients. The micro-organisms identified were diverse and there was little consistency among the antibiotic regimens utilised. Conclusion: Based on the antibiotic susceptibilities of causative bacteria along with extrapolation from recommendations and guidelines identified in the literature, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appear to be the most appropriate antibiotics choices for prophylaxis or treatment of localised infection. Antibiotic choices for the empiric treatment of systemic infection requires further research and clarification.","Cevik J., Hunter-Smith D.J., Rozen W.M.",10.1016/j.tmaid.2022.102312,Travel Medicine And Infectious Disease
Effect Of Prolonged Exposure To Disinfectants In The Antimicrobial Resistance Profile Of Relevant Micro-Organisms: A Systematic Review,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitutes a major global health threat, to a very large extent due to the inadequate use of antibiotics. Additionally, the misuse of disinfectants can also trigger the selection of resistant clones, where micro-organisms develop an adaptative response and progress to resistance mechanisms. Cross-resistance may occur when a biocide's selective pressure induces antimicrobial resistance. Aim: To acknowledge the potential relationship between repeated and/or prolonged exposure to disinfectants and antimicrobial resistance profile adjustment. Methods: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published until December 2023 that were related to the interaction between disinfectants and antimicrobials were included. Further selection was based on the methodology of exposure. Findings: Selected studies included testing about ‘exposure to sublethal concentrations’ for seventeen disinfectants. The mechanism of action for the majority of the disinfectants involved interactions with the cell membrane. Chlorhexidine was the most studied disinfectant. Conclusion: Adaptation phenomena related to disinfectant exposure were documented and development of cross-resistance to antimicrobials was verified for several species, including Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. Changes associated with disinfectant exposure also influenced biofilm formation, colony morphology, and efflux pump activity – three relevant determinants of loss of antibiotic efficacy.","Fernandes Â.R., Rodrigues A.G., Cobrado L.",10.1016/j.jhin.2024.04.017,Journal Of Hospital Infection
Cabozantinib Reverses Topotecan Resistance In Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Nci-H460/Tpt10 Cell Line And Tumor Xenograft Model,"Cabozantinib (CBZ) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, which could also inhibit the ABCG2 transporter function. Therefore, CBZ could re-sensitize cancer cells that are resistant to ABCG2 substrate drugs including topotecan (TPT). However, its reversal effect against TPT resistance has not been tested in a TPT-induced resistant cancer model. In this study, a new TPT selected human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-resistant cell model NCI-H460/TPT10 with ABCG2 overexpression and its parental NCI-H460 cells were utilized to investigate the role of CBZ in drug resistance. The in vitro study showed that CBZ, at a non-toxic concentration, could re-sensitize NCI-H460/TPT10 cells to TPT by restoring intracellular TPT accumulation via inhibiting ABCG2 function. In addition, the increased cytotoxicity by co-administration of CBZ and TPT may be contributed by the synergistic effect on downregulating ABCG2 expression in NCI-H460/TPT10 cells. To further verify the applicability of the NCI-H460/TPT10 cell line to test multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal agents in vivo and to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of CBZ on reversing TPT resistance, a tumor xenograft mouse model was established by implanting NCI-H460 and NCI-H460/TPT10 into nude mice. The NCI-H460/TPT10 xenograft tumors treated with the combination of TPT and CBZ dramatically reduced in size compared to tumors treated with TPT or CBZ alone. The TPT-resistant phenotype of NCI-H460/TPT10 cell line and the reversal capability of CBZ in NCI-H460/TPT10 cells could be extended from in vitro cell model to in vivo xenograft model. Collectively, CBZ is considered to be a potential approach in overcoming ABCG2-mediated MDR in NSCLC. The established NCI-H460/TPT10 xenograft model could be a sound clinically relevant resource for future drug screening to eradicate ABCG2-mediated MDR in NSCLC.","Lei Z.-N., Teng Q.-X., Gupta P., Zhang W., Narayanan S., Yang D.-H., Wurpel J.N.D., Fan Y.-F., Chen Z.-S.",10.3389/fcell.2021.640957,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Antibiotic Susceptibility Of Plant-Derived Lactic Acid Bacteria Conferring Health Benefits To Human,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) confer health benefits to human when administered orally. We have recently isolated several species of LAB strains from plant sources, such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, and medicinal plants. Since antibiotics used to treat bacterial infection diseases induce the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in intestinal microflora, it is important to evaluate the susceptibility of LAB strains to antibiotics to ensure the safety and security of processed foods. The aim of the present study is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against several plant-derived LAB strains. When aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin (SM), kanamycin (KM), and gentamicin (GM), were evaluated using LAB susceptibility test medium (LSM), the MIC was higher than when using Mueller–Hinton (MH) medium. Etest, which is an antibiotic susceptibility assay method consisting of a predefined gradient of antibiotic concentrations on a plastic strip, is used to determine the MIC of antibiotics world-wide. In the present study, we demonstrated that Etest was particularly valuable while testing LAB strains. We also show that the low susceptibility of the plant-derived LAB strains against each antibiotic tested is due to intrinsic resistance and not acquired resistance. This finding is based on the whole-genome sequence information reflecting the horizontal spread of the drug-resistance genes in the LAB strains.","Noda M., Danshiitsoodol N., Inoue Y., Okamoto T., Sultana N., Sugiyama M.",10.1038/s41429-019-0218-4,Journal Of Antibiotics

Early Detection Of Metallo-Β-Lactamase Ndm-1- And Oxa-23 Carbapenemase-Producing Acinetobacter Baumannii In Libyan Hospitals,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen causing various nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to characterise the molecular support of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii clinical isolates recovered from two Libyan hospitals. Bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods, and carbapenem resistance determinants were studied by PCR amplification and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for typing of the isolates. All 36 imipenem-resistant isolates tested were identified as A. baumannii. The bla(OXA-23) gene was detected in 29 strains (80.6%). The metallo-β-lactamase bla(NDM-1) gene was detected in eight isolates (22.2%), showing dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in Tripoli Medical Center and Burn and Plastic Surgery Hospital in Libya, including one isolate that co-expressed the bla(OXA-23) gene. MLST revealed several sequence types (STs). Imipenem-resistant A. baumannii ST2 was the predominant clone (16/36; 44.4%). This study shows that NDM-1 and OXA-23 contribute to antibiotic resistance in Libyan hospitals and represents the first incidence of the association of these two carbapenemases in an autochthonous MDR A. baumannii isolated from patients in Libya, indicating that there is a longstanding infection control problem in these hospitals.","Mathlouthi N., El Salabi A.A., Ben Jomàa-Jemili M., Bakour S., Al-Bayssari C., Zorgani A.A., Kraiema A., Elahmer O., Okdah L., Rolain J.-M., Chouchani C.",10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.03.007,International Journal Of Antimicrobial Agents
Detection Of Eskape Bacterial Pathogens At The Point Of Care Using Isothermal Dna-Based Assays In A Portable Degas-Actuated Microfluidic Diagnostic Assay Platform,"IMPORTANCE: This paper describes a portable system for rapidly identifying bacteria in resource-limited environments; we highlight the capabilities of the technology by detecting different pathogens within the ESKAPE collection, which cause nosocomial infections. The system is designed around isothermal DNA-based assays housed within an autonomous plastic cartridge that are designed with the end user in mind, who may have limited technological training. Displaying excellent sensitivity and specificity, the assay systems that we demonstrate may enable future diagnoses of bacterial infection to guide the development of effective chemotherapies and may have a role in areas beyond health where rapid detection is valuable, including in industrial processing and manufacturing, food security, agriculture, and water quality testing.An estimated 1.5 billion microbial infections occur globally each year and result in ∼4.6 million deaths. A technology gap associated with commercially available diagnostic tests in remote and underdeveloped regions prevents timely pathogen identification for effective antibiotic chemotherapies for infected patients. The result is a trial-and-error approach that is limited in effectiveness, increases risk for patients while contributing to antimicrobial drug resistance, and reduces the lifetime of antibiotics. This paper addresses this important diagnostic technology gap by describing a low-cost, portable, rapid, and easy-to-use microfluidic cartridge-based system for detecting the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) bacterial pathogens that are most commonly associated with antibiotic resistance. The point-of-care molecular diagnostic system consists of a vacuum-degassed microfluidic cartridge preloaded with lyophilized recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays and a small portable battery-powered electronic incubator/reader. The isothermal RPA assays detect the targeted ESKAPE pathogens with high sensitivity (e.g., a limit of detection of ∼10 nucleic acid molecules) that is comparable to that of current PCR-based assays, and they offer advantages in power consumption, engineering, and robustness, which are three critical elements required for the point-of-care setting.","Renner L.D., Zan J., Hu L.I., Martinez M., Resto P.J., Siegel A.C., Torres C., Hall S.B., Slezak T.R., Nguyen T.H., Weibel D.B.",10.1128/AEM.02449-16,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Epidemiology And Resistance Patterns Of Bacterial And Fungal Colonization Of Biliary Plastic Stents: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Background: Plastic stents used for the treatment of biliary obstruction will become occluded over time due to microbial colonization and formation of biofilms. Treatment of stent-associated cholangitis is often not effective because of inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents or antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to assess the current bacterial and fungal etiology of stent-associated biofilms, with particular emphasis on antimicrobial resistance. Methods: Patients with biliary strictures requiring endoscopic stent placement were prospectively enrolled. After the retrieval of stents, biofilms were disrupted by sonication, microorganisms were cultured, and isolates were identified by matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and/or biochemical typing. Finally, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for various antimicrobial agents. Selected stents were further analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Among 120 patients (62.5% males, median age 64 years) with biliary strictures (35% malignant, 65% benign), 113 double pigtail polyurethane and 100 straight polyethylene stents were analyzed after a median indwelling time of 63 days (range, 1-1274 days). The stent occlusion rate was 11.5% and 13%, respectively, being associated with a significantly increased risk of cholangitis (38.5% vs. 9.1%, P<0.001). Ninety-five different bacterial and 13 fungal species were detected; polymicrobial colonization predominated (95.8% vs. 4.2%, P<0.001). Enterococci (79.3%), Enterobacteriaceae (73.7%), and Candida spp. (55.9%) were the leading pathogens. Candida species were more frequent in patients previously receiving prolonged antibiotic therapy (63% vs. 46.7%, P = 0.023). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci accounted for 13.7%, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae with co-resistance to ciprofloxacin accounted for 13.9%, and azole-resistant Candida spp. accounted for 32.9% of the respective isolates.","Lübbert C., Wendt K., Feisthammel J., Moter A., Lippmann N., Busch T., Mössner J., Hoffmeister A., Rodloff A.C.",10.1371/journal.pone.0155479,Plos One
Empiric Systemic Antibiotics For Hospitalized Patients With Severe Odontogenic Infections,"Introduction Odontogenic infections may lead to severe head and neck infections with potentially great health risk. Age, location of purulent affected sites and beta-lactam allergy are some mentionable factors regarding patients’ in-hospital stay and course of disease. Are there new challenges regarding bacteria’ antibiotic resistance for empiric treatment and what influences do they have on patients’ clinical course? Methods We analyzed in a 4-year retrospective study the medical records of 294 in-hospital patients with severe odontogenic infections. On a routine base bacteria were identified and susceptibility testing was performed. Length of stay in-hospital was evaluated regarding patients’ age, beta-lactam allergy profile, affected sites and bacteria susceptibility to empiric antibiotics. Results Length of stay in-hospital was detected to be associated with affected space and penicillin allergy as well (p < 0.05). Isolates presented large amounts of aerobic gram-positive bacteria (64.2%), followed by facultative anaerobic bacteria (gram+/15.8%, gram−/12.7%). Tested ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (or without) and cephalosporins displayed high susceptibility rates, revealing distinguished results regarding clindamycin (p < 0.05). Co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin showed high overall susceptibility rates (MOX: 94.7%, COTRIM: 92.6%). Discussion This study demonstrates ampicillin/sulbactam in addition to surgical intervention is a good standard in treatment of severe odontogenic neck infections. Cephalosporins seem to be a considerable option as well. If beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin represent relevant alternatives. Conclusion Age, allergic profile and bacteria’ resistance patterns for empiric antibiotics have an influence on patients in-hospital stay. Ampicillin/sulbactam proves itself to be good for empiric antibiosis in severe odontogenic infections. Furthermore cephalosporins could be considered as another option in treatment. However moxifloxacin and co-trimoxazol deserves further investigation as empiric antibiosis in odontogenic infections if beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed.","Zirk M., Buller J., Goeddertz P., Rothamel D., Dreiseidler T., Zöller J.E., Kreppel M.",10.1016/j.jcms.2016.05.019,Journal Of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery
Spontaneous Mutation Rate Is A Plastic Trait Associated With Population Density Across Domains Of Life,"Rates of random, spontaneous mutation can vary plastically, dependent upon the environment. Such plasticity affects evolutionary trajectories and may be adaptive. We recently identified an inverse plastic association between mutation rate and population density at 1 locus in 1 species of bacterium. It is unknown how widespread this association is, whether it varies among organisms, and what molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis or repair are required for this mutation-rate plasticity. Here, we address all 3 questions. We identify a strong negative association between mutation rate and population density across 70 years of published literature, comprising hundreds of mutation rates estimated using phenotypic markers of mutation (fluctuation tests) from all domains of life and viruses. We test this relationship experimentally, determining that there is indeed density-associated mutation-rate plasticity (DAMP) at multiple loci in both eukaryotes and bacteria, with up to 23-fold lower mutation rates at higher population densities. We find that the degree of plasticity varies, even among closely related organisms. Nonetheless, in each domain tested, DAMP requires proteins scavenging the mutagenic oxidised nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP. This implies that phenotypic markers give a more precise view of mutation rate than previously believed: having accounted for other known factors affecting mutation rate, controlling for population density can reduce variation in mutation-rate estimates by 93%. Widespread DAMP, which we manipulate genetically in disparate organisms, also provides a novel trait to use in the fight against the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Such a prevalent environmental association and conserved mechanism suggest that mutation has varied plastically with population density since the early origins of life.","Krašovec R., Richards H., Gifford D.R., Hatcher C., Faulkner K.J., Belavkin R.V., Channon A., Aston E., Mcbain A.J., Knight C.G.",10.1371/journal.pbio.2002731,Plos Biology
Telavancin Activity When Tested By A Revised Susceptibility Testing Method Against Uncommonly Isolated Gram-Positive Pathogens Responsible For Documented Infections In Hospitals Worldwide (2011-2013),"The broth microdilution method for telavancin susceptibility testing was revised and now utilises DMSO as solvent for stock solution preparation and diluent for stock solution dilution, following CLSI guidelines for water-insoluble agents. The revised method also incorporates polysorbate 80 in the test medium to mitigate drug binding to plastics. This revised methodology provides more accurate and reproducible MIC determinations, which results in values lower than the previously established method. This study was conducted to re-establish telavancin potencies and susceptibility profiles (using updated interpretive criteria) against a collection of uncommon clinical pathogens (3821 isolates). Telavancin showed MIC(50) values of 0.06 mg/L against tested staphylococcal species (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 98.1-100.0% susceptible), with lower results for Staphylococcus hominis (MIC(50), ≤0.015 mg/L), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (MIC;bsubesub&, ≤0.015 mg/L) and Staphylococcus simulans (MIC(50), 0.03 mg/L). Vancomycin (MIC(50), 1 mg/L), daptomycin (MIC(50), 0.12-1 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC(50), 0.25-1 mg/L) had MIC(50) results at least four-fold higher than telavancin against CoNS. Streptococci (99.2-100.0% susceptible) displayed telavancin MIC(50) values of 0.015-0.03 mg/L. Vancomycin (MIC;bsubesub&, 0.25-0.5 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC;bsubesub&, 0.5-1 mg/L) had higher MIC;bsubesub& results against streptococci, whilst daptomycin MIC;bsubesub & values varied from ≤0.06 mg/L to 0.5 mg/L. Micrococcus, Listeria and Corynebacterium spp. were inhibited by telavancin at ≤0.015, ≤0.03 and ≤0.06 mg/L, respectively. Telavancin exhibited potent in vitro activity against this collection, greater than comparators (daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin). This study provides new baseline MIC results for telavancin and confirms the spectrum and potency of telavancin against less commonly encountered Gram-positive species. ;copy; 2015 The Authors.

"Microbiology And Antibiotic Resistance Profiles Of Orbital Subperiosteal Abscesses: A Comparison Of Pediatric, Adolescent, And Adult Populations","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the microbiology and antibiotic resistance profiles of orbital subperiosteal abscesses (SPA) among 3 age cohorts. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care center through a medical record search to identify patients with orbital cellulitis and SPA on imaging from January 1, 2000 to September 10, 2022. Patients were categorized into pediatric (<9 years old), adolescent (9-18 years old), and adult (>18 years old) cohorts. Primary outcomes included culture and antibiotic susceptibility results. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention. Results: Of the 153 SPA patients included, 62 (40.5%) were in the pediatric cohort (4 months-8 years, mean 5.0 ± 2.7), 51 (33.3%) were adolescent (9-18 years, 12.7 ± 2.8), and 40 (26.1%) were adult (19-95, 51.8 ± 19.3). Viridians group Streptococci were the most frequent organisms isolated across groups. The anaerobic infection rate was higher in the adult compared to the pediatric group (23.0% vs, 4.0%, p = 0.017), while that of the adolescent did not differ significantly from either. Pediatric patients carried a lower rate of clindamycin resistance than adolescent and adult cohorts, who shared similar rates (0 vs. 27.0% and 28.0%, respectively; p = 0.016). There were progressive increases in duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy (p < 0.195) and rate of surgical intervention (p < 0.001) going from younger to older cohorts. Conclusion: Organisms isolated from orbital SPA from the past 2 decades demonstrate a predominance of Streptococcal species. Older age may be associated with anaerobic infection, clindamycin resistance, and more aggressive management. Adolescent infections are more similar to adult rather than pediatric counterparts but may require less aggressive management than the former.","Gibbons A.B., Niknahad A., Bacorn C., Li E.",10.1097/IOP.0000000000002408,Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
"The Pi3K Subunits, P110Α And P110Β Are Potential Targets For Overcoming P-Gp And Bcrp-Mediated Mdr In Cancer","Background: PI3K/AKT is a vital signaling pathway in humans. Recently, several PI3K/AKT inhibitors were reported to have the ability to reverse cancer multidrug resistance (MDR); however, specific targets in the PI3K/AKT pathways and the mechanisms associated with MDR have not been found because many of the inhibitors have multiple targets within a large candidate protein pool. AKT activation is one presumed mechanism by which MDR develops during cancer treatment. Methods: The effects of inhibiting PI3K 110α and 110β by BAY-1082439 treatment and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout were examined to determine the possible functions of BAY-1082439 and the roles of PI3K 110α and 110β in the reversal of MDR that is mediated by the downregulation of P-gp and BCRP. Inhibition of AKT with GSK-2110183 showed that the downregulation of P-gp and BCRP is independent of generalized AKT inactivation. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, MTT, flow cytometry and JC-1 staining analyses were conducted to study the reversal of MDR that is mediated by P-gp and BCRP in cancer cells. An ATPase assay and a structural analysis were also used to analyze the potential mechanisms by which BAY-1082439 specifically targets PI3K 110α and 110β and nonspecifically influences P-gp and BCRP. Results: By inhibiting the activation of the PI3K 110α and 110β catalytic subunits through both the administration of BAY-1082439 and the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of Pik3ca and Pik3cb, the ATP-binding cassette transporters P-gp/ABCB1 and BCRP/ABCG2 were downregulated, thereby reestablishing the drug sensitivity of human epidermoid carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) MDR cells. Inhibition of AKT did not reverse the MDR mediated by P-gp or BCRP. The ABC family proteins and AKT may play MDR-enhancing roles independently. Conclusions: The reversal of the dual functions of ABC-transporter-mediated and AKT-activation-enhanced MDR through the inhibition or knockout of PI3K 110α or 110β promises to improve current strategies based on combined drug treatments to overcome MDR challenges.","Zhang L., Li Y., Wang Q., Chen Z., Li X., Wu Z., Hu C., Liao D., Zhang W., Chen Z.-S.",10.1186/s12943-019-1112-1,Molecular Cancer
Prevalence And Resistance Profile Of Bacteria Isolated From Wound Infections Among A Group Of Patients In Upper Egypt: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study,"AIM: This cross-sectional survey aimed to identify aerobic bacteria, antimicrobial resistance, and multi-drug resistance profiles of bacteria isolated from different wound infections among a group of Egyptian patients. RESULTS: Of 120 positive samples, 170 isolates were identified. Polymicrobial infections were determined in 55% of samples. The dominant Gram-positive isolated strains were Staphylococcus aureus, especially from wound infections because of accidents (71.8%). Piperacillin, methicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were all highly resistant to S. aureus and Coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in wound infections was 89.9%. S. aureus showed superior sensitivity to vancomycin (85.3%) and linezolid (81.3%). The highest prevalence of Gram-negative isolates was for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%), which was highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin (79.2%) and highly resistant to levofloxacin (83.3%). Several isolates revealed a multi-drug resistance profile (52.4%). The overall MDR rate of Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates were 50% and 54.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MRSA isolated from various wound infections and MDR is a warning issue in Upper Egypt. It should implement a health education strategy and hygiene measures to prevent the spread of wound infection-causing organisms in the community.","Ahmed E.F., Rasmi A.H., Darwish A.M.A., Gad G.F.M.",10.1186/s13104-023-06379-y,Bmc Research Notes
Comparison Of Long-Read Sequencing Technologies In The Hybrid Assembly Of Complex Bacterial Genomes,"Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (<300 bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long-read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods affect hybrid assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures, and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies, as well as comparing to long-read-only assembly with Flye followed by short-read polishing with Pilon. Hybrid assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction, and was superior to the longread assembly and polishing approach evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.","De Maio N., Shaw L.P., Hubbard A., George S., Sanderson N.D., Swann J., Wick R., Oun M.A., Stubberfield E., Hoosdally S.J., Crook D.W., Peto T.E.A., Sheppard A.E., Bailey M.J., Read D.S., Anjum M.F., Sarah Walker A., Stoesser N.",10.1099/mgen.0.000294,Microbial Genomics
Contribution Of Protein Synthesis Depression To Poly-Β-Hydroxybutyrate Accumulation In Synechocystis Sp. Pcc 6803 Under Nutrient-Starved Conditions,"Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in cyanobacteria, which accumulates as energy and carbon sources through the action of photosynthesis, is expected to substitute for petroleum-based plastics. This study first demonstrated that PHB accumulation was induced, with the appearance of lipid droplets, in sulfur (S)-starved cells of a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, however, to a lower level than in nitrogen (N)- or phosphorus (P)-starved cells. Concomitantly found was repression of the accumulation of total cellular proteins in the S-starved cells to a similar level to that in N-starved cells, and a severer level than in P-starved cells. Intriguingly, PHB accumulation was induced in Synechocystis even under nutrient-replete conditions, upon repression of the accumulation of total cellular proteins through treatment of the wild type cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, chloramphenicol, or through disruption of the argD gene for Arg synthesis. Meanwhile, the expression of the genes for PHB synthesis was hardly induced in S-starved cells, in contrast to their definite up-regulation in N- or P-starved cells. It therefore seemed that PHB accumulation in S-starved cells is achieved through severe repression of protein synthesis, but is smaller than in N- or P-starved cells, owing to little induction of the expression of PHB synthesis genes.","Hirai K., Nojo M., Sato Y., Tsuzuki M., Sato N.",10.1038/s41598-019-56520-w,Scientific Reports
Analysis Of Ceftazidime/Avibactam Use For Treating Carbapenem-Resistant Infections In Critically Ill Patients With Thermal Or Inhalation Injuries,"Rising antimicrobial resistance is a pressing public health concern. An increase in carbapenem-resistant organisms has led to increased use of novel antibiotics, such as ceftazidime/avibactam (CZ/AV). However, recent studies have shown increasing treatment failures and resistance rates associated with ceftazidime/avibactam use. The efficacy of CZ/AV has not been studied in patients with thermal or inhalation injuries, where pharmacokinetic derangements are common and patients are often subject to longer lengths of stay and several antimicrobial courses that may lead to higher resistance rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients with thermal and inhalation injuries including clinical success, the frequency of adverse effects, and emergence of resistance. In the 17 courses of CZ/AV evaluated, clinical success occurred in 71% (12/17) of courses. Enterobacter cloacae was the most commonly treated pathogen. Resistance developed in 18% (3/17) of courses, but follow-up sensitivities were not evaluable for every case. Although lower than desired, clinical success rates in this sample were similar to other reported populations treated with CZ/AV. However, the emergence of resistance occurred more frequently and was likely underreported in this sample. Although limited by its small sample size, this study emphasizes the concern of growing antimicrobial resistance among even novel antibiotics. Resistance can develop during the initial course, stressing the importance of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. Furthermore, attention and resources should be given to proper pharmacokinetic analysis of medications given in severely ill, hypermetabolic populations.","Martin K., Arif F., Sultan-Ali I., Velamuri S.R., Hill D.M.",10.1093/jbcr/irac038,Journal Of Burn Care And Research
Synergistic Toxic Mechanisms Of Microplastics And Triclosan Via Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Inhibition–Mediated Autophagy In The Freshwater Water Flea Daphnia Magna,"Since a mixed state of environmental contaminants, including microplastics (MPs), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs), exists in aquatic ecosystems, it is necessary to evaluate not only the adverse effects of exposure to a single stressor but to combined stressors. In this study, we exposed the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna to 2 μm MPs and triclosan (TCS), one of PPCPs, for 48 h to investigate the synergistic toxic consequences of simultaneous exposure to both pollutants. We measured in vivo endpoints, antioxidant responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and autophagy-related protein expression via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. While MPs single exposure did not show toxic effects in water fleas, simultaneous exposure to TCS and MPs was associated with significantly greater deleterious effects in the form of increased mortality and alterations in antioxidant enzymatic activities compared with water fleas exposed to TCS alone. In addition, MXR inhibition was confirmed by measurement of the expression of P-glycoproteins and multidrug-resistance proteins in MPs-exposed groups, which led to the accumulation of TCS. Overall, these results suggest that simultaneous exposure to MPs and TCS resulted in higher TCS accumulation via MXR inhibition, leading to synergistic toxic effects such as autophagy in D. magna.","Lee J.-S., Oh Y., Park H.E., Lee J.-S., Kim H.S.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165214,Science Of The Total Environment
Severe And Complicated Soft Tissue Infections: A Single-Centre Case Series,"Objective: To assess the demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and economic burden of patients with a diagnosis of complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI). Method: The demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, surgical interventions, cost of treatment, and outcome of patients diagnosed with cSSTIs between January 2017 and December 2019 were retrospectively analysed. Results: A total of 24 patients with cSSTIs were included in the study. The median age was 53 (22-85) years, and 14 (58%) were female. The most common comorbidity was diabetes (54%). On admission, 75% of patients presented with sepsis, and 70% had a high-grade Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) score. The causative microorganism was isolated from 21 (87%) patients, and the multidrug resistance rate of Gram-negative bacteria was 50%. The median number of debridements was 3 (1-12). In all, 11 patients were followed up in the intensive care unit, and the mortality rate was 29%. The presence of confusion (p=0.025), causative Gram-negative microorganisms (p=0.009), hyponatraemia (p=0.034), the need for intensive care (p=0.001), anti-meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus antibiotics (p=0.023) and the rate of antibiotic changes during treatment (p=0.019) were significantly higher in the non-survival patient group. Hyponatraemia was a significant independent risk factor for mortality (p=0.048). The median cost of per-patient treatment was $9453 USD in the non-surviving and $1536 in the surviving group. Conclusion: It is important to know possible factors and local resistance rates at the beginning of empirical antibacterial and surgical treatment. The presence of hyponatraemia, sepsis and a high LRINEC score can be considered to be the mortality predictors.

Pan-Cancer Analysis And Single-Cell Analysis Revealed The Role Of Abcc5 Transporter In Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of liver cancer. Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage because the early symptoms are not obvious. For advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy and targeted therapy seem to be a promising direction. Finding a new prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and exploring its role in the immune microenvironment is of great value. ABCC transporters have previously been associated with drug resistance in hepatocellular tumors, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conducted a study on ABCC5 in HCC and found that the expression of ABCC5 was up-regulated in HCC and was associated with poor prognosis. Further exploration revealed that ABCC5 was associated with immune infiltration of hepatocellular carcinoma. Single-cell analysis revealed a potential relationship between ABCC5 and immune cell differentiation. Therefore, it is significant to continue to explore the role of ABCC5 in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Chen L., Yang Z., Cao Y., Hu Y., Bao W., Wu D., Hu L., Xie J., Yu H.",10.1080/19336950.2021.1968592,Channels
When Limb Surgery Has Become The Only Life-Saving Therapy In Fop: A Case Report And Systematic Review Of The Literature,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare disease in which heterotopic ossification (HO) is formed in muscles, tendons and ligaments. Traumatic events, including surgery, are discouraged as this is known to trigger a flare-up with risk of subsequent HO. Anesthetic management for patients with FOP is challenging. Cervical spine fusion, ankylosis of the temporomandibular joints, thoracic insufficiency syndrome, restrictive chest wall disease, and sensitivity to oral trauma complicate airway management and anesthesia and pose life-threatening risks. We report a patient with FOP suffering from life-threatening antibiotic resistant bacterial infected ulcers of the right lower leg and foot. The anesthetic, surgical and postoperative challenges and considerations are discussed. In addition, the literature on limb surgeries of FOP patients is systemically reviewed. The 44 year-old female patient was scheduled for a through-knee amputation. Airway and pulmonary evaluation elicited severe abnormalities, rendering standard general anesthesia a rather complication-prone approach in this patient. Thus, regional anesthesia, supplemented with intravenous analgosedation and N(2)O-inhalation were performed in this case. The surgery itself was securely planned to avoid any unnecessary tissue damage. Postoperatively the patient was closely monitored for FOP activity by ultrasound and [(18)F]PET/CT-scan. One year after surgery, a non-significant amount of HO had formed at the operated site. The systematic review revealed seventeen articles in which thirty-two limb surgeries in FOP patients were described. HO reoccurrence was described in 90% of the cases. Clinical improvement due to improved mobility of the operated joint was noted in 16% of the cases. It should be noted, though, that follow-up time was limited and no or inadequate imaging modalities were used to follow-up in the majority of these cases. To conclude, if medically urgent, limb surgery in FOP is possible even when general anesthesia is not preferred. The procedure should be well-planned, alternative techniques or procedures should be tested prior to surgery and special attention should be paid to the correct positioning of the patient. According to the literature recurrent HO should be expected after surgery of a limb, even though it was limited in the case described.","Botman E., Treurniet S., Lubbers W.D., Schwarte L.A., Schober P.R., Sabelis L., Peters E.J.G., Van Schie A., De Vries R., Grunwald Z., Smilde B.J., Nieuwenhuijzen J.A., Visser M., Micha D., Bravenboer N., Coen Netelenbos J., Teunissen B.P., De Graaf P., Raijmakers P.G.H.M., Smit J.M., Eekhoff E.M.W.",10.3389/fendo.2020.00570,Frontiers In Endocrinology
Acinetobacter Nosocomialis Utilizes A Unique Type Vi Secretion System To Promote Its Survival In Niches With Prey Bacteria,"Pathogenic bacteria of the Acinetobacter genus pose a severe threat to human health worldwide due to their strong adaptability, tolerance, and antibiotic resistance. Most isolates of these bacteria harbor a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that allows them to outcompete co-residing microorganisms, but whether this system is involved in acquiring nutrients from preys remains less studied. In this study, we found that Ab25, a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter nosocomialis, utilizes a T6SS to kill taxonomically diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. The T6SS of Ab25 is constitutively expressed, and among the three predicted effectors,T6e1, a member of the RHS effectorfamily, contributes the most for its antimicrobial activity. T6e1 undergoes self-cleavage, and a short carboxyl fragment with nuclease activity is sufficientto kill target cells via T6SS injection. Interestingly, strain Ab25 encodes an orphan VgrG protein, which when overexpressed blocks the firingof its T6SS. In niches such as dry plastic surfaces, the T6SS promotes prey microorganism-dependent survival of Ab25. These results reveal that A. nosocomialis employs T6SSs that are highly diverse in their regulation and effectorcomposition to gain a competitive advantage in environments with scarce nutrient supply and competing microbes. IMPORTANCE The type VI secretion system (T6SS) plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to environmental challenges. Members of the Acinetobacter genus, particularly A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis, are notorious for their multidrug resistance and their ability to survive in harsh environments. In contrast to A. baumannii, whose T6SS has been well-studied, few research works have focused on A. nosocomialis. In this study, we found that an A. nosocomialis strain utilizes a contitutively active T6SS to kill diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. Although T6SS structural proteins of A. nosocomialis are similar to those of A. baumannii, the effectorrepertoire differsgreatly. Interestingly, the T6SS of the A. nosocomialis strain codes for an ophan VgrG protein, which blocks the firingof the system when overexpressed, suggesting the existence of a new regulatory mechanism for the T6SS. Importantly, although the T6SS does not provide an advantage when the bacterium is grown in nutrient-rich medium, it allows A. nosocomialis to survive better in dry surfaces that contain co-existing bacteria. Our results suggest that killing of co-residing microorganisms may increase the effectivenessof strategies designed to reduce the fitness of Acinetobacter bacteria by targeting their T6SS.","Sun Y., Wang L., Zhang M., Jie J., Guan Q., Fu J., Chu X., Chen D., Li C., Song L., Luo Z.-Q.",10.1128/mbio.01468-24,Mbio
"Pda/Cu Bioactive Hydrogel With ""Hot Ions Effect"" For Inhibition Of Drug-Resistant Bacteria And Enhancement Of Infectious Skin Wound Healing","Quick and effective sterilization of drug-resistant bacteria inevitably became an ever-growing global challenge. In this study, a multifunctional composite (PDA/Cu-CS) hydrogel mainly composed of polydopamine (PDA) and copper-doped calcium silicate ceramic (Cu-CS) was prepared. It was confirmed that PDA/copper (PDA/Cu) complexing in the composite hydrogel played a key role in enhancing the photothermal performance and antibacterial activity. Through a unique ""hot ions effect"", created by the heating of Cu ions through the photothermal effect of the composite hydrogel, the hydrogel showed high-efficiency, quick, and long-term inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, the hydrogel possessed remarkable bioactivity to stimulate angiogenesis. The in vivo results confirmed that the ""hot ions effect"" of the composite hydrogel removed existing infection in the wound area efficiently and significantly promoted angiogenesis and collagen deposition during infectious skin wound healing. Our results suggested that the design of multifunctional hydrogels with ""hot ions effect"" may be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of infectious wounds.","Xu Q., Chang M., Zhang Y., Wang E., Xing M., Gao L., Huan Z., Guo F., Chang J.",10.1021/acsami.0c08890,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Treatment Of Infected Wounds With Methylene Blue Photodynamic Therapy: An Effective And Safe Treatment Method,"Background: Bacterial resistance is a problem during the process of healing of infected wounds. As a therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has broad-spectral antibacterial activity and non-selective action, which makes it possible to deal with antibiotic resistance. Methylene blue is a commonly used medicine, but it is rarely used in clinical practice as a photosensitizer. The effect of methylene blue photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) on infected wounds remains unclear. Our study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MB-PDT on infected wounds. Methods: In this study, 5 patients with infected wounds were included, all of them were treated with MB-PDT by using the red LED which irradiated the wounds directly (635 nm, 120 J/cm2, 100 mW/cm2). The frequency and course of treatment were determined by the severity of the wound. Results: After an average of 4 PDT session, infected wounds of all the patients healed. The treatment also showed an excellent cosmetic effect. According to the follow-up periods of patients ranged from 3 to 12 months, there were no recurrences and side effects. Conclusions: MB-PDT has a great healing effect on infected wounds, and it is a safe, cheap and active clinical therapy.","Shen X., Dong L., He X., Zhao C., Zhang W., Li X., Lu Y.",10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.102051,Photodiagnosis And Photodynamic Therapy
Epidemiology And Outcomes Of Bloodstream Infections In 177 Severe Burn Patients From An Industrial Disaster: A Multicentre Retrospective Study,"Objectives: To determine the characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and to evaluate the impact of BSIs on mortality in severe burn patients. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 20 tertiary hospitals. A total of 185 patients who experienced a massive dust explosion in eastern China were included. Results: After exclusion, 177 patients were analysed. The median total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 95% (interquartile range 85%–98%). Inhalation injuries occurred in 97.2%. The overall 90-day mortality was 35% (62/177). During the study period, 120 (67.8%) patients developed 253 episodes of BSI with 323 unique causative pathogens. Sixty-six episodes were polymicrobial infections. Catheter-related BSIs (CRBSIs) accounted for 41.5% of the episodes. Acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.9%) and Candida (12.7%) were the most common organisms. Antimicrobial resistance was found in 63.5% of the isolates, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. Patients who developed BSIs had a greater illness severity at admission to the intensive care unit, and worse outcomes. After adjusting for demographics, severity of illness and treatment characteristics in a multivariate logistic model, there was a trend toward BSI increasing the risk of 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI 0.9–12.9; p=0.069). In subgroup analyses, CRBSIs (adjusted OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.3–24.9; p=0.021 versus no BSI) and polymicrobial BSIs (adjusted OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.3–28.1; p=0.020 versus no BSI) had greater risk of 90-day mortality. Conclusions: A strikingly high rate of BSIs was observed in severe burn patients. Gram-negative organisms and fungi were the leading causes. CRBSIs and polymicrobial BSIs were associated with high mortality.","Tang C.Q., Li J.Q., Shou B.M., Pan B.H., Chen T.S., Xiao Y.Q., Zheng X.P., Xiao S.C., Tan Q., Xia Z.F.",10.1016/j.cmi.2017.06.009,Clinical Microbiology And Infection
Phytochemical Inhibition Of Multidrug Resistance Protein-1 As A Therapeutic Strategy For Hemangioendothelioma,"Aims: Hemangiomas are endothelial cell tumors and the most common soft tissue tumors in infants. They frequently cause deformity and can cause death. Current pharmacologic therapies have high-risk side-effect profiles, which limit the number of children who receive treatment. The objectives of this work were to identify the mechanisms through which standardized berry extracts can inhibit endothelial cell tumor growth and test these findings in vivo. Results: EOMA cells are a validated model that generates endothelial cell tumors when injected subcutaneously into syngeneic (129P/3) mice. EOMA cells treated with a blend of powdered natural berry extracts (NBE) significantly inhibited activity of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP-1) compared to vehicle controls. This resulted in nuclear accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and apoptotic EOMA cell death. When NBE-treated EOMA cells were injected into mice, they generated smaller tumors and had a higher incidence of apoptotic cell death compared to vehicle-treated EOMA cells as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for tumor-bearing mice showed that NBE treatment significantly prolonged survival compared to vehicle-treated controls. Innovation: These are the first reported results to show that berry extracts can inhibit MRP-1 function that causes apoptotic tumor cell death by accumulation of GSSG in the nucleus of EOMA cells where NADPH oxidase is hyperactive and causes pathological angiogenesis. Conclusions: These findings indicate that berry extract inhibition of MRP-1 merits consideration and further investigation as a therapeutic intervention and may have application for other cancers with elevated MRP-1 activity.","Biswas A., Clark E.C., Sen C.K., Gordillo G.M.",10.1089/ars.2016.6881,Antioxidants And Redox Signaling
"Molecular Epidemiology, Microbiological Features And Infection Control Strategies For Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii In A German Burn And Plastic Surgery Center (2020–2022)","Background: Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) frequently causes both healthcare-associated infections and nosocomial outbreaks in burn medicine/plastic surgery and beyond. Owing to the high antibiotic resistance, infections are difficult to treat, and patient outcomes are often compromised. The environmental persistence capability of CRAB favors its transmission in hospitals. A comprehensive analysis and understanding of CRAB epidemiology and microbiology are essential for guiding management. Methods: A three-year retrospective cohort study (2020–2022) was conducted in a German tertiary burn and plastic surgery center. In addition to epidemiological analyses, microbiological and molecular techniques, including whole-genome sequencing, were applied for the comprehensive examination of isolates from CRAB-positive patients. Results: During the study period, eight CRAB cases were found, corresponding to an overall incidence of 0.2 CRAB cases per 100 cases and an incidence density of 0.35 CRAB cases per 1000 patient-days. Six cases (75%) were treated in the burn intensive care unit, and four cases (50%) acquired CRAB in the hospital. Molecular analyses comprising 74 isolates supported the epidemiologic assumption that hospital acquisitions occurred within two separate clusters. In one of these clusters, environmental CRAB contamination of anesthesia equipment may have enabled transmission. Furthermore, molecular diversity of CRAB isolates within patients was observed. Conclusions: CRAB can pose a challenge in terms of infection prevention and control, especially if cases are clustered in time and space on a ward. Our study demonstrates that high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial isolates from single patients can greatly aid in understanding transmission chains and helps to take precision control measures.","Vital M., Woltemate S., Schlüter D., Krezdorn N., Dieck T., Dastagir K., Bange F.-C., Ebadi E., Vogt P.M., Knegendorf L., Baier C.",10.1186/s13756-024-01459-5,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Lack Of Effects Of Polystyrene Micro- And Nanoplastics On Activity And Expression Of Human Drug Transporters,"Micro- and nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) constitute emerging and widely-distributed environmental contaminants to which humans are highly exposed. They possibly represent a threat for human health. In order to identify cellular/molecular targets for these plastic particles, we have analysed the effects of exposure to manufactured polystyrene (PS) MPs and NPs on in vitro activity and expression of human membrane drug transporters, known to interact with chemical pollutants. PS MPs and NPs, used at various concentrations (1, 10 or 100 µg/mL), failed to inhibit efflux activities of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-glycoprotein, MRPs and BCRP in ABC transporter-expressing cells. Furthermore, PS particles did not impair the transport of P-glycoprotein or BCRP substrates across intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers. Uptake activities of solute carriers (SLCs) such as OCT1 and OCT2 (handling organic cations) or OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OAT1 and OAT3 (handling organic anions) were additionally not altered by PS MPs/NPs in HEK-293 cells overexpressing these SLCs. mRNA expression of ABC transporters and of the SLCs OCT1 and OATP2B1 in Caco-2 cells and human hepatic HepaRG cells were finally not impaired by a 48-h exposure to MPs/NPs. Altogether, these data indicate that human drug transporters are unlikely to be direct and univocal targets for synthetic PS MPs/NPs.","Tastet V., Le Vée M., Verger A., Brandhonneur N., Bruyère A., Fardel O.",10.1016/j.etap.2024.104563,Environmental Toxicology And Pharmacology
Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Promote Bacterial Conjugative Plasmid Transfer,"Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) regularly enter aquatic environments due to their ubiquity in consumer products and engineering applications. However, the effects of MWCNT pollution on the environmental microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether these carbon nanoparticles can elevate the spread of antimicrobial resistance by promoting bacterial plasmid transfer, which has previously been observed for copper nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties as well as for microplastics. Through a combination of experimental liquid mating assays between Pseudomonas putida donor and recipient strains with plasmid pKJK5::gfpmut3b and mathematical modeling, we here demonstrate that the presence of MWCNTs leads to increased plasmid transfer rates in a concentration- dependent manner. The percentage of transconjugants per recipient significantly increased from 0.21 ± 0.04% in absence to 0.41 ± 0.09% at 10 mg L21 MWCNTs. Similar trends were observed when using an Escherichia coli donor hosting plasmid pB10. The identified mechanism underlying the observed dynamics was the agglomeration of MWCNTs. A significantly increased number of particles with .6 mm diameter was detected in the presence of MWCNTs, which can in turn provide novel surfaces for bacterial interactions between donor and recipient cells after colonization. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that MWCNT agglomerates were indeed covered in biofilms that contained donor bacteria as well as elevated numbers of green fluorescent transconjugant cells containing the plasmid. Consequently, MWCNTs provide bacteria with novel surfaces for intense cell-to-cell interactions in biofilms and can promote bacterial plasmid transfer, hence potentially elevating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Weise K., Winter L., Fischer E., Kneis D., De La Cruz Barron M., Kunze S., Berendonk T.U., Jungmann D., Klumper U.",10.1128/spectrum.00410-22,Microbiology Spectrum
Host Range And Genetic Plasticity Explain The Coexistence Of Integrative And Extrachromosomal Mobile Genetic Elements,"Self-transmissible mobile genetic elements drive horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes. Some of these elements integrate in the chromosome, whereas others replicate autonomously as plasmids. Recent works showed the existence of few differences, and occasional interconversion, between the two types of elements. Here, we enquired on why evolutionary processes have maintained the two types of mobile genetic elements by comparing integrative and conjugative elements (ICE) with extrachromosomal ones (conjugative plasmids) of the highly abundant MPFT conjugative type. We observed that plasmids encode more replicases, partition systems, and antibiotic resistance genes, whereas ICEs encode more integrases and metabolism-associated genes. ICEs and plasmids have similar average sizes, but plasmids are much more variable, have more DNA repeats, and exchange genes more frequently. On the other hand, we found that ICEs are more frequently transferred between distant taxa. We propose a model where the different genetic plasticity and amplitude of host range between elements explain the co-occurrence of integrative and extrachromosomal elements in microbial populations. In particular, the conversion from ICE to plasmid allows ICE to be more plastic, while the conversion from plasmid to ICE allows the expansion of the element's host range.","Cury J., Oliveira P.H., De La Cruz F., Rocha E.P.C.",10.1093/molbev/msy123,Molecular Biology And Evolution
"Effects Of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics And Benzylalkyldimethylethyl Compounds On System Performance, Microbial Community And Resistance Genes In Sulfur Autotrophic Denitrification System","Benzylalkyldimethylethyl ammonium compounds (BAC) and polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC MPs), as the frequently detected pollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), have attracted more concerns on their ecosystem risks. Therefore, this study investigated how the sulfur autotrophic denitrification (SAD) system responded to the single and joint stress of PVC MPs (1, 10 and 100 mg/L) and BAC (0.5, 5 and 10 mg/L). After 100 days of operation, the presence of 10 mg/L BAC led to obviously inhibitory effects on system performance and microbial metabolic activity. And the additions of PVC MPs or/and BAC stimulated the proliferation of intracellular resistance genes (RGs), whereas exposure to BAC increased the abundances of extracellular RGs and free RGs in water more significantly. Compared to the joint stress, BAC single stress resulted in higher abundances of free RGs in water, which further increased the risk of RGs propagation. Moreover, the interaction between mobile genetic elements and extracellular polymeric substances further increased the spread of RGs. Pathogens might be the potential hosts of RGs and enriched in SAD system and plastisphere, thereby leading to more serious ecological risks. This study will broaden the understanding of the environmental hazards posed by PVC MPs and BAC in WWTPs.","Wang Y., Gao J., Wang Z., Zhao Y., Yuan Y., Sun L., Zeng L., Wang H.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135197,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Polystyrene Nanoplastics Of Different Particle Sizes Regulate The Polarization Of Pro-Inflammatory Macrophages,"Microplastics (MPs) are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in size, and nanoplastics (NPs) are those MPs with a particle size of less than 1000 nm or 100 nm. The prevalence of MPs in the environment and human tissues has raised concerns about their potential negative effects on human health. Macrophages are the major defence against foreign substances in the intestine, and can be polarized into two types: the M1 phenotype and the M2 phenotype. However, the effect of NPs on the polarization of macrophages remains unclear. Herein, we selected polystyrene, one of the most plastics in the environment and controlled the particle sizes at 50 nm and 500 nm respectively to study the effects on the polarization of macrophages. We used mouse RAW264.7 cell line models in this macrophage-associated study. Experiments on cell absorption showed that macrophages could quickly ingest polystyrene nanoplastics of both diameters with time-dependent uptake. Compared to the untreated group and 10 μg/mL treatment group, macrophages exposed to 50 μg/mL groups (50 nm and 500 nm) had considerably higher levels of CD86, iNOS, and TNF-α, but decreased levels of aCD206, IL-10, and Arg-1. According to these findings, macrophage M1 and M2 polarization can both be induced and inhibited by 50 μg/mL 50 nm and 500 nm polystyrene nanoplastics. This work provided the first evidence of a possible MPs mode of action with appropriate concentration and size through the production of polarized M1, providing dietary and environmental recommendations for people, particularly those with autoimmune and autoinflammatory illnesses.","Jiang W., Liu Y., Wu Y., Zhang L., Zhang B., Zhou S., Zhang P., Xu T., Wu M., Lv S.",10.1038/s41598-024-67289-y,Scientific Reports
Physicochemical Behavior And Ecological Risk Of Biofilm-Mediated Microplastics In Aquatic Environments,"The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments has become the core of environmental pollution. In recent years, the inevitable biological aging process of MPs in natural environments has attracted researchers’ attention. Such biofilm-mediated MPs, colonized by microorganisms, affect the physicochemical behavior and potential ecological risks of MPs. Therefore, it is critical to understand the impact of MPs’ biofilm formation on the environmental fate and toxicity of MPs. This review presented a comprehensive discussion of the impact of biofilm formation on unique carrier effects and toxicological effects of MPs in aquatic environments. First, the biofilm formation process on MPs, the compositions of microorganisms in biofilm and the factors influencing biofilm formation were briefly summarized. Second, the sorption of pollutants and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes onto biofilm-mediated MPs were discussed. Third, the potential effects of biofilm-mediated MPs on gut microbiota were analyzed. Finally, gaps in the field that require further investigations were put forward. This review emphasized that biofilm-mediated MPs have higher environmental risks and ecotoxicity, which is helpful in providing new insights for pollution prevention and control of new pollutant MPs.","Zhou R., Huang X., Ni Y., Ma Z., Wei H., Jin Q., Ding Z.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.107209,Aquatic Toxicology
Risk Factors And Distribution Of Mdros Among Patients With Healthcare Associated Burn Wound Infection,"Introduction Patients with burn wounds are more susceptible to develop healthcare associated (HA) infection. Bacterial isolates from HA burn wound infection vary from one place to the other and also differ in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of HA burn wound infection, risk factors and to determine the microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated pathogens. Methods This was a one-year retrospective descriptive study conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, in Al-Babtain Burn and Plastic Surgery center, Kuwait. The identification of bacterial isolates was conducted by conventional biochemical methods according to standard microbiological techniques and commercially available kits using analytical profile index procedure. Results Total body surface area >35% affected and length of stay more than 14 days were statistically significant risk factors for HA burn infection (RR of 10.057 and 5.912, respectively). Analysis of microbiological profile of these positive cultures indicated that the most common isolated organism was Acinetobacter baumannii followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multidrug resistant organisms composed 65.85% of the positive isolates. Vancomycin, tigecycline, teicoplanin and linezolid showed 100% effectiveness for all Gram positive isolates. For Gram negative organisms, imipenem and meropenem showed 38.71% and 41.93% efficacy, respectively. Conclusion Identification of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns helps to tailor the required antibiotic policy to minimize the acquired infections among these vulnerable patients.","Alfadli M., El-Sehsah E.M., Ramadan M.A.-M.",10.18683/germs.2018.1147,Germs
Evidence From In Vitro And In Vivo Studies On The Potential Health Repercussions Of Micro- And Nanoplastics,"Plastic is a synthetic or semisynthetic polymer with numerous physicochemical properties, and its fragmentation can give rise to microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). These particles can enter our ecosystem, where a process of constant degradation facilitates their dispersion and absorption by different species, affecting multiple organs and systems. The objective of this review was to provide an update on the potential health effects of MPs and NPs indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies have described the absorption of plastic particles of different sizes and have documented their proinflammatory effects and genotoxicity, which can lead to the structural alteration of cells. MPs and NPs have also been implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MPs and NPs can access organisms via dietary and respiratory pathways and through the epidermis. Their reported effects include: changes in microbiota and digestive enzyme production; inflammatory processes at respiratory level; circulatory and reproductive system disorders; and neurotoxicity, inducing behavioral changes. In vitro and in vivo studies have evidenced detrimental effects in different organs and systems as a function of the dose, size, and chemical properties of plastic particles. Further research is warranted to determine the effects on human health of these particles at environmental doses.","González-Acedo A., García-Recio E., Illescas-Montes R., Ramos-Torrecillas J., Melguizo-Rodríguez L., Costela-Ruiz V.J.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130826,Chemosphere

Evaluation Of Pathogen Distribution And Antimicrobial Resistance In Breast Plastic Surgery Infection,"Background: The demand for mammaplasty has increased in recent years, and infection remains one of the common and serious post-operative complications. In this study, we analyzed the pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of breast plastic surgery infections, and compared the differences in pathogenic species between surgical procedures. Methods: The number of each species was counted in the microbial samples of breast plastic surgery infections in Plastic Surgery Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2011 to December 2021. The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing data were analyzed using WHONET 5.6 software. The surgical techniques, the period of infection, and other details were gathered in accordance with the clinical data. Results: There were a total of 42 cases included, and 43 different types of pathogenic bacteria, mostly gram-positive bacteria, were found. CoNS (13/43) and Staphylococcus aureus (22/43) made up the majority. The most prevalent of the five Gram-negative bacteria was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results of drug sensitivity tests indicate that S. aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin, cotrimoxazole, and linezolid, whereas CoNS is highly sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, and chloramphenicol. Both of these bacteria show high resistance to erythromycin and penicillin. Breast augmentation, breast reconstruction, and breast reduction surgery were the most frequently associated breast surgery procedures in this study with infections, with the highest number of infections occurring following breast augmentation with fat grafting, breast reduction surgery, and breast reconstruction with autologous tissue. Various breast plastic surgery procedures have different common pathogens of infection, but the most prevalent are CoNS and S. aureus. Additionally, the majority of the infections in this study were in the early stages. Conclusions: Gram-positive bacteria were the predominant cause of breast plastic surgery infections, and the types of infection strains, the period of infection onset, and the antibiotic susceptibility of prevalent strains varied between breast plastic procedures.","Su X., Hu J., Jiang F., Wu Y., He J., Jia X., Zhan S.",10.1111/jocd.15919,Journal Of Cosmetic Dermatology
Size-Dependent Enhancement On Conjugative Transfer Of Antibiotic Resistance Genes By Micro/Nanoplastics,"Recently micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) have raised intensive concerns due to their possible enhancement effect on the dissemination of antibiotic genes. Unfortunately, data is still lacking to verify the effect. In the study, the influence of polystyrene MNPs on the conjugative gene transfer was studied by using E. coli DH5ɑ with RP4 plasmid as the donor bacteria and E. coli K12 MG1655 as the recipient bacteria. We found that influence of MNPs on gene transfer was size-dependent. Small MNPs (10 nm in radius) caused an increase and then a decrease in gene transfer efficiency with their concentration increasing. Moderate-sized MNPs (50 nm in radius) caused an increase in gene transfer efficiency. Large MNPs (500 nm in radius) had almost no influence on gene transfer. The gene transfer could be further enhanced by optimizing mating time and mating ratio. Scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) production did not affect the cell membrane permeability, indicating that the increase in cell membrane permeability was not related to ROS production. The mechanism of the enhanced gene transfer efficiency was attributed to a combined effect of the increased ROS production and the increased cell membrane permeability, which ultimately regulated the expression of corresponding genes.","Zha Y., Li Z., Zhong Z., Ruan Y., Sun L., Zuo F., Li L., Hou S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128561,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Microbial Spectrum And Resistance Of Odontogenic Abscesses - Microbiological Analysis Using Next Generation Sequencing,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to map the microbiome of odontogenic abscesses using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify bacterial and fungal species, as well as antibiotic resistances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wound swabs were taken from patients treated for odontogenic abscesses at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Bonn. NGS was used to analyze the swabs, and bioinformatic analysis assigned the genetic material to microorganism profiles and identified antibiotic resistances. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected in all samples from 51 patients. Anaerobes were found in 50 swabs, while aerobic bacteria were detected in 30. Four of the five most common bacterial genera were anaerobes (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Porphyromonas). A median of eight genera were identified per swab. Infections were mostly polymicrobial; only one case was a monoinfection with Streptococcus. Aerobic bacteria were less frequent in patients who had prior antibiotic therapy (p = 0.015). Fungi were present in 52.9% of cases, with Malassezia (33.3%), Aspergillus (9.8%), and Candida (3.9%) being the most common. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 66.7% of patients, mainly against lincosamides, macrolides and tetracyclines. Fusobacterium showed a 25.9% resistance rate to clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiome of odontogenic abscesses is polymicrobial, dominated by anaerobic bacteria, and more extensive than indicated by traditional cultural diagnostics. NGS provides detailed pathogen diagnostics, aiding in precise and individualized antibiotic therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Improved understanding of the bacterial and fungal spectrum, along with current resistance patterns of odontogenic abscesses, is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. NGS offers rapid, accurate and detailed microbiome analysis, enhancing patient-specific therapeutic strategies.","Thol F., Warwas F.B., Spuck N., Kramer F.-J., Heim N.",10.1007/s00784-024-06097-0,Clinical Oral Investigations
Surgical Antimicrobial Prophylaxis In Pediatric Patients Undergoing Plastic Surgery: A Rand/Ucla Appropriateness Method Consensus Study,"For many years, it was clearly shown that surgical procedures might be associated with surgical site infection (SSI). Many scientific institutions prepared guidelines to use in surgery to reduce abuse and misuse of antibiotics. However, in the general guidelines for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, plastic surgical procedures are not addressed or are only marginally discussed, and children were almost systematically excluded. The main aim of this Consensus document is to provide clinicians with recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis for pediatric patients undergoing plastic surgery. The following scenarios were considered: clean plastic surgery in elective procedures with an exclusive skin and subcutis involvement; clean-contaminated/contaminated plastic surgery in elective procedures with an exclusive skin and subcutis involvement; elective plastic surgery with use of local flaps; elective plastic surgery with the use of grafts; prolonged elective plastic surgery; acute burns; clean contused lacerated wounds without bone exposure; high-risk contused lacerated wounds or with bone exposure; contused lacerated wound involving the oral mucosa; plastic surgery following human bite; plastic surgery following animal bite; plastic surgery with tissue expander insertion. Our Consensus document shows that antimicrobial perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing plastic surgery is recommended in selected cases. While waiting the results of further pediatric studies, the application of uniform and shared protocols in these procedures will improve surgical practice, with a reduction in SSIs and consequent rationalization of resources and costs, as well as limiting the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance.","Esposito S., Sgarzani R., Bianchini S., Monaco S., Nicoletti L., Rigotti E., Di Pietro M., Opri R., Caminiti C., Ciccia M., Conti G., Donà D., Giuffré M., La Grutta S., Lancella L., Lima M., Vecchio A.L., Pelizzo G., Piacentini G., Pietrasanta C., Puntoni M., Simonini A., Venturini E., Staiano A., Principi N.",10.3390/antibiotics11040506,Antibiotics
Distribution And Drug Resistance Of Pathogens In Burn Patients In China From 2006 To 2019,"BACKGROUND In this study, recent trends in the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients treated at a burn ward between 2006 and 2019 were investigated. AIM To develop more effective clinical strategies and techniques for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in burn patients. METHODS Clinical samples with positive bacteria were collected from patients at the burn ward in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in China between January 2006 and December 2019. The samples were retrospectively analyzed, the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was determined, and the trends and changes in bacterial drug resistance during different period were assessed. Drug resistance in several main pathogenic bacteria from 2006 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019 was comparatively summarized and analyzed. RESULTS Samples from 17119 patients were collected and analyzed from 2006 to 2019. Surprisingly, a total of 7960 strains of different pathogenic bacteria were isolated at this hospital. Among these bacteria, 87.98% (7003/7960) of the strains were isolated from burn wounds, and only 1.34% (107/7960) were isolated from the blood of patients. In addition, 49.70% (3956/7960) were identified as Gram-positive bacteria, 48.13% (3831/7960) were Gram-negative bacteria, and the remaining 2.17% (173/7960) were classified as fungi or other pathogens. Importantly, Staphylococcus aureus (21.68%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.61%) were the top three pathogens most frequently isolated from patients. CONCLUSION In patients treated at the burn ward in this hospital from 2006 to 2019, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant clinical pathogens responsible for bacterial infections. The circumstantial detection and detailed monitoring of the intensity and growth of different pathogenic bacteria in clinical patients as well as tests of drug sensitivity during burn recovery are particularly important to provide guidelines for the application of antibiotics and other related drugs. Careful collection and correct, standard culture of bacterial specimens are also crucial to improve the efficiency of bacterial infection detection. Effective monitoring and timely clinical treatment in patients may help reduce the possibility and rate of infection as well as alleviate the effects of drug resistance among patients in burn centers.","Chen H., Yang L., Cheng L., Hu X.-H., Shen Y.-M.",10.12998/wjcc.v9.i10.2228,World Journal Of Clinical Cases

Photoaging Processes Of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics Enhance The Adsorption Of Tetracycline And Facilitate The Formation Of Antibiotic Resistance,"Microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and microorganism ubiquitously coexist in aquatic environments. MPs inevitably undergo photoaging processes in aquatic environments, affecting the interactions between MPs and antibiotics and the antibiotic resistance of microorganism. In this study, the impact of photoaging processes of MPs on their adsorption behavior of tetracycline (TC) and related formation of antibiotic resistance were investigated. It was found that the photoaging processes significantly increased the adsorption capacity of TC onto MPs, with the Q(e) increasing from 0.387 to 0.507 mg/g at 288 K and from 0.507 to 0.688 mg/g at 308 K. The site energy distribution (SED) analysis further confirmed that the enhanced adsorption capacity was attributed to more high-energy adsorption sites acquired from MPs photoaging processes. Moreover, the enhanced adsorption of TC further facilitated the formation of seven antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetG, tetK) when MPs adsorbed with TC was covered by biofilm. This study helps comprehensively understand the environmental behaviors of co-existing MPs, antibiotics and microorganisms, providing a theoretical basis for evaluating and mitigating their coexistence risks.","Tian Y., Zhu J., Ying C., Luo H., Zhang S., Zhang L., Li R., Li J.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137820,Chemosphere
"The Relevance Of Using 3D Cell Cultures, In Addition To 2D Monolayer Cultures, When Evaluating Breast Cancer Drug Sensitivity And Resistance","Solid tumours naturally grow in 3D wherein the spatial arrangement of cells affects how they interact with each other. This suggests that 3D cell culture may mimic the natural in vivo setting better than traditional monolayer (2D) cell culture, where cells are grown attached to plastic. Here, using HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines as models (BT474, HCC1954, EFM192A), the effects of culturing cells in 3D using the poly-HEMA method compared to 2D cultures were assessed in terms of cellular viability, response/resistance to anti-cancer drugs, protein expression and enzyme activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed the morphology of cells in 3D to be substantially different to those cultured in 2D. Cell viability in 3D cells was substantially lower than that of cells in 2D cultures, while 3D cultures were more resistant to the effects of HER-targeted (neratinib) and classical chemotherapy (docetaxel) drugs. Expression of proteins involved in cell survival, transporters associated with drug resistance and drug targets were increased in 3D cultures. Finally, activity of drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4 was substantially increased in 3D compared to 2D cultures. Together this data indicates that the biological information represented by 3D and 2D cell cultures is substantially different i.e. 3D cell cultures demonstrate higher innate resistance to anti-cancer drugs compared to 2D cultures, which may be facilitated by the altered receptor proteins, drug transporters and metabolising enzyme activity. This highlights the importance of considering 3D in addition to 2D culture methods in pre-clinical studies of both newer targeted and more traditional anti-cancer drugs.","Breslin S., O'Driscoll L.",10.18632/oncotarget.9935,Oncotarget
The Multixenobiotic Resistance System As A Possible Protective Response Triggered By Microplastic Ingestion In Mediterranean Mussels (Mytilus Galloprovincialis): Larvae And Adult Stages,"The emerging paradigm on plastic pollution in marine environments is that microsize particles (MPs) have far more subtle effects than bigger fragments, given their size range overlapping with that of particles ingested by filter-feeders. The impacts include gut blockage, altered feeding and energy allocation, with knock-on effects on widespread physiological processes. This study investigated whether ingestion of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) triggers protective processes in marine mussels. The Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) system is a cytoprotective mechanism acting as an active barrier against harmful xenobiotics and a route of metabolite detoxification. Both larvae and adults were employed in laboratory experiments with different concentrations of 3-μm PS-MPs (larvae), and 3-μm and 45-μm PS-MPs (adults) matching size range of planktonic food through the mussel lifecycle. Embryos grown in the presence of 3-μm PS-MPs showed significant reduction of MXR activity and down-regulation of ABCB and ABCC transcripts encoding the two main MXR-related transporters P-glycoprotein and the Multidrug resistance-related protein, respectively. In adults, effects of PS-MPs were assessed in haemocytes and gills, which showed different modulation of MXR activity and ABCB/ABCC expression according to MP size (haemocyte and gills) or particle concentration (haemocyte). These data showed that modulation of MXR activity is part of a generalized response triggered by particle ingestion.","Franzellitti S., Capolupo M., Wathsala R.H.G.R., Valbonesi P., Fabbri E.",10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.02.005,Comparative Biochemistry And Physiology Part - C: Toxicology And Pharmacology
Mapping The Microbiological Diversity Of Odontogenic Abscess: Are We Using The Right Drugs?,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was categorizing the microbial flora and susceptibility to antibiotics and to clarify to which degree the empiric administered antibiotics are suitable for therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3.5-year retrospective study evaluated hospital records of 206 patients who suffered from head and neck infections of odontogenic origin. All patients underwent surgical incision and drainage and received intravenous antibiotics and inpatient treatment. The specimens were obtained by performing a swab. RESULTS: Two hundred six patients were included with 251 strains isolated (1.22 per patient). One hundred eight strains showed antibiotic resistance. Eighty-seven patients showed at least one bacterial strain that showed antibiotic resistance (42.2%). The most frequent isolated bacteria were Streptococcus spp. (n = 116), with a high rate of antibiotic resistance (50.8%). We investigated 205 cases of antibiotic resistance in 87 subjects. Nine bacterial strains showed no susceptibility to unacid (4.3%) and 36 strains to clindamycin (17.5%). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance against clindamycin was rather high. The distribution of the afflicted spaces and isolated bacteria was alike recent findings. It is mandatory to understand that immediate surgical treatment in terms of incision and drainage is the basis in abscess treatment. Antibiotic treatment is adjunct therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Streptococcus species were the most frequently identified bacteria presenting antibiotic resistance in more than 50%. Increased resistant rates for clindamycin require reconsiderations regarding an empiric antibiotic treatment.","Heim N., Jürgensen B., Kramer F.-J., Wiedemeyer V.",10.1007/s00784-020-03350-0,Clinical Oral Investigations
Environmental Life Cycle Cost Assessment: Recycling Of Hard Plastic Waste Collected At Danish Recycling Centres,"Recycling of plastic waste is promoted by the European Union as an important step toward a circular economy. Recovered plastic waste is a complex and heterogeneous material, and the impurities and/or untargeted polymers associated to plastic waste may affect the recycling process and potentially decrease the intended benefits. An environmental and financial assessment was conducted on one tonne of hard plastic waste collected at Danish recycling centres. Three management scenarios were considered: two mechanical recycling (a simpler and a more advanced configuration, namely sMR and aMR) and a feedstock recycling (FR) scenario based on conversion through pyrolysis. Scenario aMR provided the largest savings in the highest number of impact categories (including global warming potential) and total costs; scenarios sMR and FR provided smaller savings (or even burdens), depending on the environmental impact category considered. A scenario analysis evaluating the type of energy provision, location of recycling facilities and the application of the recycled material confirmed the ranking of results with respect to global warming potential and total costs. A global sensitivity assessment of model data inputs demonstrated that three to nine parameters were typically sufficient to achieve more than 90% of total variance of the results; critical parameters were mainly related to sorting efficiencies, technical yields and market substitution factors. The study demonstrates that if high quality of the recycled plastic is achieved, both environmental savings and financial revenues are possible.","Faraca G., Martinez-Sanchez V., Astrup T.F.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.014,"Resources, Conservation And Recycling"
Evaluation Of The Red & Blue Led Effects On Cutaneous Refractory Wound Healing In Male Sprague–Dawley Rat Using 3 Different Multi-Drug Resistant Bacteria,"Objectives: Photobiomodulation (PBM) is widely used in clinical therapy, and is an effective approach to resist the bacterial infection of the cutaneous wound and modulate the wound healing process. Due to the several detriments of lasers, Red & Blue LED light (RBLL) may be a more viable light source. This study is aimed to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effect of RBLL light on different multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in vitro and male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat refractory MDR infection wound model in vivo. Materials and Methods: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Extended-spectrum β-lactamases -producing Escherichia coli (ESBLs-Eco), and the MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-Pae) were employed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of the Blue LED light in vitro. Effects of RBLL on in vivo wound healing were evaluated by analyzing time to closure, wound score, semi-quantitative test for bacterial culture, histopathological examination and Masson staining of skin tissue, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and western blot analysis (WB) of wound tissue. Results: Blue LED light inhibited MRSA, ESBLs-Eco, and MDR-Pae in vitro study. In vivo, RBLL accelerated wound healing, reduced levels of pathogenic bacteria on the wound surface while increasing the blood supply to the wound surface and inhibiting the excessive inflammatory response. Conclusion: RBLL showed a great potential gain for the treatment of MDR bacterial infected wounds, suggesting PBM therapy is an inexpensive, convenient, pain-free, and safe therapeutic intervention for refractory MDR infection wounds.","Lv Y., Chen Z., Yang Z., Yang W., Chu W., Tu Y., Xie J., Cao D.",10.1002/lsm.23515,Lasers In Surgery And Medicine

Antimicrobial Nitric Oxide Releasing Contact Lens Gels For The Treatment Of Microbial Keratitis,"Microbial keratitis is a serious sight threatening infection affecting approximately two million individuals worldwide annually. While antibiotic eye drops remain the gold standard treatment for these infections, the significant problems associated with eye drop drug delivery and the alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance has meant that there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments. In this work, a nitric oxide releasing contact lens gel displaying broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against two of the most common causative pathogens of microbial keratitis is described. The contact lens gel is composed of poly-ε-lysine (pεK) functionalized with nitric oxide (NO) releasing diazeniumdiolate moieties which enables the controlled and sustained release of bactericidal concentrations of NO at physiological pH over a period of 15 h. Diazeniumdiolate functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and the concentration of NO released from the gels was determined by chemiluminescence. The bactericidal efficacy of the gels against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was ascertained, and between 1 and 4 log reductions in bacterial populations were observed over 24 h. Additional cell cytotoxicity studies with human corneal epithelial cells (hCE-T) also demonstrated that the contact lens gels were not cytotoxic, suggesting that the developed technology could be a viable alternative treatment for microbial keratitis.","Aveyard J., Deller R.C., Lace R., Williams R.L., Kaye S.B., Kolegraff K.N., Curran J.M., D'Sa R.A.",10.1021/acsami.9b13958,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
"Promoter Methylation Patterns Of Abcb1, Abcc1 And Abcg2 In Human Cancer Cell Lines, Multidrug-Resistant Cell Models And Tumor, Tumor-Adjacent And Tumor-Distant Tissues From Breast Cancer Patients","Overexpression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in tumor tissues is considered a major cause of limited efficacy of anticancer drugs. Gene expression of ABC transporters is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including changes in the DNA methylation status. Most of the studies published so far only report promoter methylation levels for either ABCB1 or ABCG2, and data on the methylation status for ABCC1 are scarce. Thus, we determined the promoter methylation patterns of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in 19 human cancer cell lines. In order to contribute to the elucidation of the role of DNA methylation changes in acquisition of a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, we also analyzed the promoter methylation patterns in drug-resistant sublines of the cancer cell lines GLC-4, SW1573, KB-3-1 and HL-60. In addition, we investigated if aberrant promoter methylation levels of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 occur in tumor and tumor-surrounding tissues from breast cancer patients. Our data indicates that hypomethylation of the ABCC1 promoter is not cancer type-specific but occurs in cancer cell lines of different origins. Promoter methylation was found to be an important mechanism in gene regulation of ABCB1 in parental cancer cell lines and their drug-resistant sublines. Overexpression of ABCC1 in MDR cell models turned out to be mediated by gene amplification, not by changes in the promoter methylation status of ABCC1. In contrast to the promoters of ABCC1 and ABCG2, the promoter of ABCB1 was significantly higher methylated in tumor tissues than in tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues from breast cancer patients.","Spitzwieser M., Pirker C., Koblmüller B., Pfeiler G., Hacker S., Berger W., Heffeter P., Cichna-Markl M.",10.18632/oncotarget.12332,Oncotarget
Farnesol Emulsion As An Effective Broad-Spectrum Agent Against Eskape Biofilms,"The family of ESKAPE pathogens is comprised of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter. Together they are the main contributors of nosocomial infections and are well established for their ability to “escape” antibiotics. Farnesol is an FDA-approved cosmetic and flavoring agent with significant anti-biofilm properties. In a proprietary emulsion, farnesol has been shown to be capable of disrupting S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii biofilms. The current work demonstrates that this farnesol emulsion reduces the number of viable bacteria, while also leading to reductions in biomass, of the other three ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter, both in vitro and in an ex vivo human skin model. A concentration of 0.5 mg/mL was effective for impeding biofilm development of all three bacteria, while 1 mg/mL for E. faecium and K. pneumoniae, or 0.2 mg/mL for E. cloacae, was able to kill bacteria in established biofilms. Contrary to antibiotics, no resistance to farnesol was observed for E. faecium or K. pneumoniae. The results indicate that farnesol is effective for direct cell killing and also has the ability to induce biofilm detachment from surfaces, as confirmed using Live/Dead image analysis. Our findings confirm that farnesol emulsion is an effective broad-spectrum agent to impede ESKAPE biofilms.","Tan L., Ma R., Katz A.J., Levi N.",10.3390/antibiotics13080778,Antibiotics

Polymyxin-B is generally considered a last-resort antibiotic. In this study, we isolated a carbapenem- and polymyxin-B resistant K. pneumoniae phage BL02 for the first time in Southwestern China and evaluated its biological characteristics and whole-genome sequence. Polymyxin-B resistant K. pneumoniae, (CK02), was isolated from the blood of a male with severe septic shock, and phage BL02 was screened and purified from the hospital sewage. BL02 could lyse 40 out of 46 CRKP isolates (86.96%) and has high activity in the pH range of 6-10 and the temperature range of 4-55 °C. The latency period of BL02 was about 10 min and the lysis period was about 50 min. The genome results showed that BL02 was a linear dsDNA with a total length of 175,595 bp and a GC content of 41.83%. A total of 275 ORFs were predicted and no tRNA, rRNA, drug resistance genes, or virulence genes were found in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BL02 belongs to the family Straboviridae. Treatment of infected mice with two antibiotics (tigecycline or ceftazidime/avibactam) resulted in 7-day survival rates of 28.57% and 42.86%, respectively. In contrast, the survival rate of mice in the single-dose BL02-treated group was 71.43%. In summary, this preclinical study isolated a phage capable of lysing polymyxin-B resistant K. pneumoniae and validated its safety and efficacy in an in vivo model, which provides a reference for further research on controlling MDR pathogens.","Liang Z., Shi Y.-L., Peng Y., Xu C., Zhang C., Chen Y., Luo X.-Q., Li Q.-M., Zhao C.-L., Lei J., Yuan Z.-Q., Peng Y.-Z., Song B.-Q., Gong Y.-L.",10.1016/j.virusres.2023.199126,Virus Research
"Effects Of Supplementation With A Combination Of Β-Hydroxy-Β-Methyl Butyrate, L-Arginine, And L-Glutamine On Postoperative Recovery Of Quadriceps Muscle Strength After Total Knee Arthroplasty","RESULTS: The maximal quadriceps strength was 1.1±0.62 Nm/Kg before surgery and 0.7±0.9 Nm/Kg after surgery 14 days in the control group (p=0.02), and 1.1±0.3 Nm/Kg before surgery and 0.9±0.4 Nm/Kg after surgery 14 days in the HMB/Arg/Gln group. Although the control group experienced a significant loss of muscle strength after the surgery, the HMB/Arg/Gln group did not. There was no significant difference in total energy expenditure between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Consuming HMB/Arg/Gln supplementation may suppress the loss of muscle strength after TKA. Intervention with exercise and nutrition appears to enable patients to maintain their quadriceps strength.OBJECTIVES: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed in knee osteoarthritis patients is reported to be immediately followed by a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength. We investigated the effects of supplementation with a combination β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate, L-arginine, and L-glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) on the postoperative recovery of quadriceps muscle strength in patients after TKA.METHODS: Study subjects were 23 patients (12 women; mean age: 70.5) who underwent TKA. The patients were randomly allocated into the control group or the group that consumed HMB/Arg/Gln supplementation (HMB/Arg/Gln group). HMB/Arg/Gln supplementation or control food were consumed for 5 days before the surgery and for 28 days after the surgery, and maximal quadriceps strength was measured at 7 days before the surgery, and at 14, 28 and 42 days after the surgery. During the study, total energy expenditure was measured using a lifestyle recording device. The two groups followed the rehabilitation in the same way.","Nishizaki K., Ikegami H., Tanaka Y., Imai R., Matsumura H.",10.6133/apjcn.2015.24.3.01,Asia Pacific Journal Of Clinical Nutrition

Dissecting The Effects Of Co-Exposure To Microplastics And Sulfamethoxazole On Anaerobic Digestion,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are frequently and simultaneously detected in sewage and sludge, raising global concerns in recent years. However, their combined effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) remain unclear. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the combinations of different MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate) with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on AD performance and microbial communities. The combined stress slightly decreased the chemical oxygen demand removal rate and total gas/methane production. Furthermore, co-exposure to MPs and SMX visibly changed the anaerobic sludge morphology during AD, reduced the methanogen activity, and increased the residual propionic acid concentration versus a control. The decreased relative abundances of Euryarchaeota ranged from 1.88% to 4.63% in the experimental groups compared with CK, suggesting that the microbial communities were inevitably affected by exposure to SMX alone or combined MPs/SMX. Interestingly, among the top 50 genera, only two were negatively related to a few antibiotic resistance genes, implying that sludge exhibited widespread multiple resistances. The correlation analysis between the MPs and microbial communities suggested that the MP properties, such as the aperture-desorption of MPs, may impact the microbial variations. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of coexisting MPs/SMX on AD.","Kong L., Shi X.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123562,Journal Of Environmental Management
Co-Occurrence Of Microplastics And Triclosan Inhibited Nitrification Function And Enriched Antibiotic Resistance Genes In Nitrifying Sludge,"As more and more microplastics (MPs) and triclosan (TCS), which are added in consumer products, enter wastewater treatment plants with sewage, there are concerns about the impacts of the co-occurrence of MPs and TCS on biological wastewater treatment. In this study, the co-effects of four 1 mg/L MPs (polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (PA)) and 0.5 mg/L TCS on nitrification were investigated in lab-scale nitrifying sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) (SBR-PE, SBR-PS, SBR-PVC and SBR-PA) relative to control which received no MPs (SBR-CK). The removal rates of NH(4)(+)-N and TCS in SBR-CK were around 100% and 92%, respectively. Compared with SBR-CK, no measurable inhibition was observed on nitrification in SBR-PE and SBR-PS, however, SBR-PVC and SBR-PA rapidly lost nitrification function during 14 days, which might be due to the reducing of MLSS caused by PVC, PA and TCS co-loading. Furthermore, PS, PVC and PA decreased the removal of TCS. The co-occurrence of TCS and PS, PVC, PA increased extracellular polymeric substances, reduced microbial diversity and shifted microbial communities. Notably, the acrA-03, mexF, fabI, intI1, intI3 and IS613 genes were enriched by MPs and TCS co-loading. Therefore, the removal of MPs and TCS from wastewater should be prioritized.","Wang Z., Gao J., Li D., Dai H., Zhao Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123049,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antifungal Activity Of Ionic Liquids Based On (-)-Menthol: A Mechanism Study,"The mechanism of toxicity of chiral ionic liquids with (1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthol [Cn-Am-Men][Cl] (n=10, 11 or 12) in the fungus Candida albicans is reported here. Ionic liquids were more toxic towards Candida strain lacking all identified multidrug resistance efflux pumps. Moreover, the compounds tested inhibited C. albicans filamentation at the concentration at which detached fungal cells also adhered to the plastic surface. Our results showed the high activity of all the tested chiral ionic liquids in the permeabilization of C. albicans' membranes and in the digestion and interruption of the cell wall. The investigated ionic liquids thus have potential as disinfectants because besides their antifungal and antiadhesive action these compounds do not cause hemolysis.","Suchodolski J., Feder-Kubis J., Krasowska A.",10.1016/j.micres.2016.12.008,Microbiological Research
Neuropilin-2 Inhibits Drug Resistance And Progression Of Melanoma Involving The Mir-331-3P Regulated Cascade,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that are crucial in the development and progression of tumours. Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer and is resistant to most of the chemotherapeutic agents. However, the role of miRs in melanoma remains poorly studied. Objective: The work aimed to demonstrate that miR-331-3p is downregulated in melanoma against the benign melanocytic nevi. Methods: RT-PCR analysis was performed for the expression of proteins; cell proliferation and wound healing assays were carried out. Flow cytometry study was conducted for cell cycle anal-ysis; colony formation assay was performed by soft agar method. For developing a tumour xeno-graft model, nu/nu mice were selected. Results: Up-regulation of miR-331-3p in melanoma cells decreased cell proliferation, cell migration, and also drug resistance. Over-expression of miR-331-3p resulted in suppression of NRP2 and up-regulation of E-cadherin levels. Moreover, the levels of MDR1, ABCG-2, and ABCG-5 were decreased. However, the knockdown of NRP2 demonstrated similar effects as that of miR-331-3p overexpression in tumour cells. Overexpression of miR-331-3p caused significant inhibition of tumour growth and its metastasis in mice model of melanoma, which was associated with depletion of NRP2 protein and increased expression of E-cadherin. However, the effects of miR-331-3p on the migration, cell proliferation, and self-renewal were overturned by the upregulation of NRP2, which also resulted in the inhibition of E-cadherin and overexpression of MDR-1, ABCG-2, and ABCG-5. Conclusion: The findings point out the key role of miR-331-3p in the progression and drug resistance of melanoma involving NRP2.","Xie Q., Zhang R., Liu D., Yang J., Hu Q., Shan C., Li X.",10.2174/1874467216666221220111756,Current Molecular Pharmacology
"Draft Genome Of Novel Cyanobacteria Sphaerothrix Gracilis Isolated From Coastal Microplastics Reveal Insights To Chemical Ecology, Bloom And Plastic-Utilization Potential","Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic organisms which are found across many ecosystems, including freshwater and marine habitats. They are also found on natural and artificial surfaces. In this study, we cultured and characterise a novel cyanobacterium from the surfaces of foam microplastics of tropical coastal waters. We study the chemical ecology of this cyanobacterium, Sphaerothrix gracilis gen. et sp. nov., together with its potential to form harmful cyanobacterial blooms and bioremediation applications to combat plastic pollution. The genome of S. gracilis spanned 6.7 Mbp, with identification of antibiotic resistance, nitrogen-fixation, plastic-degrading and genes involved in harmful metabolite production. The transport of potentially harmful S. gracilis in coastal environments could have severe implications on human health and food security, especially in times of a cyanobacterial bloom.","Curren E., Kuwahara V.S., Yoshida T., Leong S.C.Y.",10.1007/s10142-024-01328-9,Functional And Integrative Genomics
Ampc Hyperproduction In A Cedecea Davisae Implant-Associated Bone Infection During Treatment: A Case Report And Therapeutic Implications,"Background: Data on antimicrobial resistance mechanisms are scanty for Cedecea spp., with very variable antibiotic resistance patterns documented. Here we report the first in vivo resistance evolution of a C. davisae clinical isolate in a patient with a complex hand trauma and provide insight in the resistance mechanism, leading to therapeutic implications for this pathogen. Case presentation: Cedecea davisae was isolated from a patient with hand trauma during a first surgical debridement. Six days after primary surgical treatment and under antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and later cefepime, follow up cultures yielded C. davisae which demonstrated a resistance development. The susceptible parental isolate and its resistant derivative were characterized by whole genome sequencing, ampC, ompC and ompF by RT- PCR. The resistant derivative demonstrated an A224G SNP in ampD, the transcriptional regulator of ampC, leading to a His75Arg change in the corresponding AmpD protein. AmpC transcription of the resistant derivative was 362-times higher than the susceptible isolate. Transcription levels of ompF and ompC were 8.5-fold and 1.3-fold lower, respectively, in the resistant derivative. Downregulation of OmpF putatively resulted from a mutation in the presumed promoter region upstream of the dusB-Fis operon, a proposed regulator for ompF. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the in vivo resistance development of C. davisae within 7 days similar to that of the members of the Enterobacter cloacae complex. Our findings add valuable information for future therapeutic management of these opportunistic pathogens as they warrant the same empirical treatment as AmpC producers.","Notter J., Seiffert S.N., Zimmermann-Kogadeeva M., Bösch A., Wenger R., Strahm C., Frischknecht M., Livermore D.M., Babouee Flury B.",10.1186/s12879-021-07000-y,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Clinical Epigenetics And Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infections: Host Remodelling In Critical Illness,"The inappropriate use of antibiotics in man is driving to insurgence of pathogenic bacteria resistant to multiple drugs (MDR) representing a challenge in critical illness. The interaction of MDR bacteria with host cells can guide molecular perturbations of host transcriptional programmes involving epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms, mainly DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs leading to pathogen survival. Clinical evidence of epigenetic manipulation from MDR bacteria mainly arises from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila infection suggesting possible biomarkers of disease. For example, DNA hypermethylation of E-cadherin (CDH1), upstream transcription factor 1/2 (USF1/2), WW domain containing oxidoreductase (WWOX), and mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) genes in gastric mucosa is correlated with malignancy suggesting useful biomarkers of early disease state. Moreover, upregulated circulating miR-361-5p, miR-889, miR-576-3p may be useful biomarkers to discriminate tuberculosis patients. Moreover, Listeria monocytogenes can indirectly induce H3 hyperacetylation leading to inflammation in human endothelial cells whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa excretes QS 2-AA to directly induce H3 deacetylation leading to bacterial persistence in human monocytes. Remarkably, epigenetic-sensitive drugs may aid to counteract MDR in clinical setting. Trichostatin A, a histone deacetyltransferase inhibitor (HDACi), leads to AMP β-defensin 2 (HBD2) gene up-regulation in human epithelial cells suggesting a useful ‘epi-therapy’ for Escherichia coli-induced intestinal diseases. We update on the most current clinical studies focusing on epigenetic changes involved in bacterial-host interactions and their putative role as biomarkers or drug targets to improve precision medicine and personalized therapy in critical illness and transplantation setting.","Crimi E., Benincasa G., Cirri S., Mutesi R., Faenza M., Napoli C.",10.1080/15592294.2020.1748918,Epigenetics
Clinical Characteristics Of Pyogenic Flexor Tenosynovitis In Pediatric Patients,"Purpose To characterize the clinical presentation, common pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment methods associated with pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis (PFT) in pediatric patients. Methods Patients who underwent surgical treatment for PFT at a large tertiary-care children's hospital between 2001 and 2015 were identified. Descriptive summary statistics were reported on patient demographics, presenting symptoms and clinical examination features, culture results, treatment strategies, and early complications. Results Thirty-two patients (71.9% male) with a mean age of 9.5 ± 5.5 years (range, 0.8–19 years) were included. At least 3 Kanavel signs were present on presentation in 62% of the cohort, with all 4 signs identified in 34%. Three children (9%) presented with 0 to 1 Kanavel signs, with semiflexed posturing of the digit as the least commonly (41%) manifested sign. The most frequently cultured organisms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (38%), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (22%), and Pasteurella multocida (13%). Multiple organisms were cultured in 19% of cases. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for a median duration of 4 days (range, 1–16 days) in all cases. Organisms were sensitive to the initial antibiotic regimen in 81% of cases. All methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections were sensitive to vancomycin and trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 83% were sensitive to clindamycin. Incision and drainage (I&D) was performed in all cases, with 18% of patients requiring repeat I&D. Surgical approaches included limited incision (80%), midaxial incision (13%), and Bruner incision (7%). The average length of hospitalization was 5.1 days. Infection resolved in all cases without readmission. No neurovascular complications were identified. Conclusions The presence of Kanavel signs at presentation are a meaningful indicator of PFT, but are not uniformly present on examination in children and adolescents. Owing to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and polymicrobial infection, empirical antibiotic therapy using broad-spectrum agents with MRSA coverage is essential. In our cohort of pediatric patients with PFT of sufficient severity to warrant surgical management, prompt I&D along with culture-guided antibiotics predictably resolves infection.

Poly(L-Ornithine)-Based Polymeric Micelles As Ph-Responsive Macromolecular Anticancer Agents,"Anticancer peptides and polymers represent an emerging field of tumor treatment and can physically interact with tumor cells to address the problem of multidrug resistance. In the present study, poly(l-ornithine)-b-poly(l-phenylalanine) (PLO-b-PLF) block copolypeptides were prepared and evaluated as macromolecular anticancer agents. Amphiphilic PLO-b-PLF self-assembles into nanosized polymeric micelles in aqueous solution. Cationic PLO-b-PLF micelles interact steadily with the negatively charged surfaces of cancer cells via electrostatic interactions and kill the cancer cells via membrane lysis. To alleviate the cytotoxicity of PLO-b-PLF, 1,2-dicarboxylic-cyclohexene anhydride (DCA) was anchored to the side chains of PLO via an acid-labile β-amide bond to fabricate PLO(DCA)-b-PLF. Anionic PLO(DCA)-b-PLF showed negligible hemolysis and cytotoxicity under neutral physiological conditions but recovered cytotoxicity (anticancer activity) upon charge reversal in the weakly acidic microenvironment of the tumor. PLO-based polypeptides might have potential applications in the emerging field of drug-free tumor treatment.","Pan M., Lu C., Zhang W., Huang H., Shi X., Tang S., Liu D.",10.3390/pharmaceutics15041307,Pharmaceutics
Loggerhead Sea Turtles As Sentinels In The Western Mediterranean: Antibiotic Resistance And Environment-Related Modifications Of Gram-Negative Bacteria,"Sea turtles possess relevant characteristics to serve as sentinel species for monitoring the health of marine ecosystems, which is currently threatened. This study examined 35 loggerhead turtles from the western Mediterranean, focusing on the oral and cloacal prevalence of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, their antibiotic resistance and the influence of several variables linked both to the animal and the environment (i.e. estimated life stage; area, season and cause of recovery; plastic ingestion). Conventional bacteriology methods led to the isolation of bacterial families commonly regarded as opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Aeromonadaceae; Enterobacteriaceae; Pseudomonadaceae; Shewanellaceae; Vibrionaceae), but pointing out sea turtles as carriers of potential zoonotic agents. The high rates of antibiotic resistance, here detected, raise important concerns on the dissemination of this phenomenon in marine environments. Moreover, several of the examined variables showed a significant influence on the prevalence of bacterial families, strengthening the role of sea turtles as mirrors of their ecosystems.","Pace A., Dipineto L., Fioretti A., Hochscheid S.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110575,Marine Pollution Bulletin

Emergence Of Multidrug- And Pandrug- Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa From Five Hospitals In Qatar,"Background: A global rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial infections has led to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. MDR Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are recognised for rapidly developing drug resistance. Despite Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the second most common GNB isolated from healthcare associated infections, the magnitude of MDR P. aeruginosa (MDR-PA) has not been evaluated in Qatar. Aim: To assess the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of MDR-PA from 5 major hospitals in Qatar. Methods: A total of 2533 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were collected over a one-year period. MDR-PA was defined as resistance to at least one agent of ≥ 3 antibiotic classes. Clinical and demographic data were collected prospectively. Findings: The overall prevalence of MDR-PA isolates was 8.1% (205/2533); the majority of isolates were from patients exposed to antibiotics during 90 days prior to isolation (85.4 %, 177/205), and the infections were mainly hospital-acquired (95.1%, 195/205) with only 4.9% from the community. The majority of MDR-PA isolates were resistant to cefepime (96.6%, 198/205), ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (91%, 186/205), and meropenem (90%, 184/205). Patient comorbidities with MDR-PA were diabetes mellitus (47.3%, n=97), malignancy (17.1%, n=35), end-stage renal disease (13.7%, n=28) and heart failure (10.7%, n=22). Conclusion: There was a significant prevalence of MDR-PA in Qatar, primarily from healthcare facilities and associated with prior antibiotic treatment.

Addressing The Challenges In Antisepsis: Focus On Povidone Iodine,"Objectives: Using antiseptics in wound care can promote healing by preventing and treating infection. However, using antiseptics can present many challenges, including issues with tolerability, inactivation by organic matter and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance/cross-resistance. This review discussed the key challenges in antisepsis, focusing on povidone-iodine (PVP-I) antiseptic. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, in January 2019, with a filter for the previous 5 years. Searches were based on the antimicrobial efficacy, antiseptic resistance, wound healing properties, and skin tolerability for the commonly used antiseptics PVP-I, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), polyhexanide (PHMB), and octenidine (OCT). Additional papers were identified based on author expertise. Results: When compared with CHG, PHMB and OCT, PVP-I had a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, actinobacteria, bacterial spores, fungi and viruses, and a similar and broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria. PVP-I was also highly effective at eradicating bacterial biofilms, which is a vitally important consideration for wound care and infection control. Despite a long history of extensive use, no resistance or cross-resistance to PVP-I has been recorded, which is in contrast with other antiseptics. Despite previous misconceptions, it has been shown that PVP-I has low allergenic properties, low cytotoxicity and can promote wound healing through increased expression of transforming growth factor beta. Conclusion: With increased understanding of the importance of tackling antimicrobial resistance and bacterial biofilms in acute and chronic wound care, alongside improved understanding of the challenges of antiseptic use, PVP-I remains a promising agent for the management of antisepsis.","Barreto R., Barrois B., Lambert J., Malhotra-Kumar S., Santos-Fernandes V., Monstrey S.",10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106064,International Journal Of Antimicrobial Agents
"Characterization And Genome Sequencing Of A Novel T7-Like Lytic Phage, Kpssk3, Infecting Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae","Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has spread globally and emerged as an urgent public health threat. Bacteriophages are considered an effective weapon against multidrug-resistant pathogens. In this study, we report a novel lytic phage, kpssk3, which is able to lyse CRKP and degrade exopolysaccharide (EPS). The morphological characteristics of kpssk3 observed by transmission electron microscopy, including a polyhedral head and a short tail, indicate that it belongs to the family Podoviridae. A one-step growth curve revealed that kpssk3 has a latent period of 10 min and a burst size of 200 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell. kpssk3 was able to lyse 25 out of 27 (92.59%) clinically isolated CRKP strains, and it also exhibited high stability to changes in temperature and pH. kpssk3 has a linear dsDNA genome of 40,539 bp with 52.80% G+C content and 42 putative open reading frames (ORFs). No antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, or integrases were identified in the genome. Based on bioinformatic analysis, the tail fiber protein of phage kpssk3 was speculated to possess depolymerase activity towards EPS. By comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis, it was determined that kpssk3 is a new T7-like virus and belongs to the subfamily Autographivirinae. The characterization and genomic analysis of kpssk3 will promote our understanding of phage biology and diversity and provide a potential strategy for controlling CRKP infection.","Shi Y., Chen Y., Yang Z., Zhang Y., You B., Liu X., Chen P., Liu M., Zhang C., Luo X., Chen Y., Yuan Z., Chen J., Gong Y., Peng Y.",10.1007/s00705-019-04447-y,Archives Of Virology

Biological Evaluation Of Non-Basic Chalcone Cyb-2 As A Dual Abcg2/Abcb1 Inhibitor,"The enhancement of drug efflux caused by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (including ABCG2 and ABCB1) overexpression is an important factor for multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancers. After testing the reversal activities of 19 chalcone and bis-chalcone derivatives on MDR cancer cell lines, we found that non-basic chalcone CYB-2 exhibited the most potent reversal activities against both ABCG2- and ABCB1-mediated MDR. The mechanistic studies show that this compound can increase the accumulation of anticancer drugs in both ABCG2- and ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cell lines, resulting from the blocked efflux function of the MDR cancer cell lines. This inhibition is due to the barred ABCG2 and ABCB1 ATPase activities rather than altering the expression or localization of ABCG2 or ABCB1 transporters. The previous studies showed that non-basic chalcones were ABCG2-specific inhibitors; however, we found that non-basic chalcone CYB-2 can be developed as an ABCG2/ABCB1 dual inhibitor to overcome MDR in cancers that co-express both ABCG2 and ABCB1. Moreover, non-basic chalcone CYB-2 has synthetic tractability compared to other chalcone-based derivatives.","Cai C.-Y., Zhang W., Wang J.-Q., Lei Z.-N., Zhang Y.-K., Wang Y.-J., Gupta P., Tan C.-P., Wang B., Chen Z.-S.",10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113848,Biochemical Pharmacology
"Antimicrobial Peptide S100A12 (Calgranulin C) Inhibits Growth, Biofilm Formation, Pyoverdine Secretion And Suppresses Type Vi Secretion System In Pseudomonas Aeruginosa","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and is the major cause of corneal infections in India and worldwide. The increase in antimicrobial resistance among Pseudomonas has prompted rise in significant research to develop alternative therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as potent alternatives to combat bacterial infections. In this study, we investigated the role of S100A12, a host defense peptide, against PAO1 and an ocular clinical isolate. Increased expression of S100A12 was observed in corneal tissues obtained from Pseudomonas keratitis patients by immunohistochemistry. S100A12 significantly inhibited growth of Pseudomonas in vitro as determined from colony forming units. Furthermore, recombinant S100A12 reduced the corneal opacity and the bacterial load in a mouse model of Pseudomonas keratitis. Transcriptome changes in PAO1 in response to S100A12 was investigated using RNA sequencing. The pathway analysis of transcriptome data revealed that S100A12 inhibits expression of genes involved in pyoverdine synthesis and biofilm formation. It also impedes several important pathways like redox, pyocyanin synthesis and type 6 secretion system (T6SS). The transcriptome data was further validated by checking the expression of several affected genes by quantitative PCR. Our study sheds light on how S100A12 impacts Pseudomonas and that it might have the potential to be used as therapeutic intervention in addition to antibiotics to combat infection in future.","Mishra P., Ch S., Hong S.J., Biswas S., Roy S.",10.1016/j.micpath.2022.105654,Microbial Pathogenesis
Silver Nanoparticle-Loaded Titanium-Based Metal-Organic Framework For Promoting Antibacterial Performance By Synergistic Chemical-Photodynamic Therapy,"The abuse of antibiotics leads to an increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which not only causes a waste of medical resources but also seriously endangers people's health and life safety. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an efficient antibacterial strategy to reduce the reliance on traditional antibiotics. Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is regarded as an intriguing antimicrobial method that is less likely to generate drug resistance, but its efficiency still needs to be further improved. Herein, a robust titanium-based metal-organic framework ACM-1 was adopted to support Ag nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain Ag NPs@ACM-1 for boosting antibacterial efficiency via synergistic chemical-photodynamic therapy. Apart from the intrinsic antibacterial nature, Ag NPs largely boost ROS production and thus improve aPDT efficacy. As a consequence, Ag NPs@ACM-1 shows excellent antibacterial activity under visible light illumination, and its minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA are as low as 39.1, 39.1, and 62.5 μg mL-1, respectively. Moreover, to expand the practicability of Ag NPs@ACM-1, two (a dense and a loose) Ag NPs@ACM-1 films were readily fabricated by simply dispersing Ag NPs@ACM-1 into heated aqueous solutions of edible agar and sequentially cooling through heating or freeze-drying, respectively. Notably, these two films are mechanically flexible and exhibit excellent antibacterial activities, and their antimicrobial performances can be well retained in their recyclable and remade films. As agar is nontoxic, degradable, inexpensive, and ecosustainable, the dense and loose Ag NPs@ACM-1 films are potent to serve as recyclable and degradable antibacterial plastics and antibacterial dressings, respectively.","Zhan X.-P., Zeng Y.-N., Li B.-X., Zheng H.-Q., Feng H.-X., Xu Z., Liu J., Lin Z.-J.",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c03555,Inorganic Chemistry
Evaluation Of The Antibacterial Activity Of Selected Pakistani Honeys Against Multi-Drug Resistant Salmonella Typhi,"Background: The development of resistance to conventional anti-typhoid drugs and the recent emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance have made it very difficult and expensive to treat typhoid fever. As the therapeutic strategies become even more limited, it is imperative to investigate non-conventional modalities. In this context, honey is a potential candidate for combating antimicrobial resistance because it contains a broad repertoire of antibacterial compounds which act synergistically at multiple sites, thus making it less likely that the bacteria will become resistant. The in vitro antibacterial activity of 100 unifloral honey samples against a blood culture isolate of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella typhi were investigated. Methods: All honey samples were evaluated for both total (acidity, osmolarity, hydrogen peroxide and non-peroxide activity) and plant derived non-peroxide antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion assay at 50% and 25% dilution in sterile distilled water and 25% in catalase solution. Manuka (Unique Manuka Factor-21) honey was used for comparison. The phenol equivalence of each honey sample from 2% to 7% (w/v) phenol was obtained from regression analysis. The antibacterial potential of each honey sample was expressed as its equivalent phenol concentration. The honey samples which showed antibacterial activity equivalent to or greater than manuka honey were considered therapeutically active honeys. Results: Nineteen honey samples (19%) displayed higher hydrogen peroxide related antibacterial activity (16-20% phenol), which is more than that of manuka honey (21-UMF). A total of 30% of the honey samples demonstrated antibacterial activity between 11 and 15% phenol similar to that of manuka honey while 51% of the honey samples did not exhibit any zone of inhibition against MDR-S. typhi at 50% (w/v) dilution. None of the indigenous honey samples displayed non-peroxide antibacterial activity. Only manuka honey showed non-peroxide antibacterial activity at 25% dilution (w/v) in catalase solution. Conclusions: The honey samples which displayed antibacterial activity equal to or greater than manuka honey may be useful in the clinical conditions where higher hydrogen peroxide related antibacterial activity is required.

The metastatic development requires tumor cells to leave their initial site, circulate in the blood stream, acclimate to new cellular environments at a remote secondary site and endure there. There are several steps in metastasis, including invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, premetastatic niche formation, micrometastasis and metastatic colonization. siRNA therapeutics are appreciated for their usefulness in treatment of cancer metastasis. However, siRNA therapy as a single therapy may not be a sufficient option for control of metastasis. By combining siRNA with targeting, functional agents or small-molecule drugs have shown potential effects that enhance therapeutic effectiveness. This review addresses multidrug resistance and metastasis in breast and ovarian cancers and highlights drug-delivery strategies using siRNA therapeutics.","Subhan A., Attia S.A., P Torchilin V.",10.2217/nnm-2021-0207,Nanomedicine
Staphylococcus Aureus Breast Implant Infection Isolates Display Recalcitrance To Antibiotic Pocket Irrigants,"Breast implant-associated infections (BIAIs) are the primary complication following placement of breast prostheses in breast cancer reconstruction. Given the prevalence of breast cancer, reconstructive failure due to infection results in significant patient distress and health care expenditures. Thus, effective BIAI prevention strategies are urgently needed. This study tests the efficacy of one infection prevention strategy: the use of a triple antibiotic pocket irrigant (TAPI) against Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of BIAIs. TAPI, which consists of 50,000 U bacitracin, 1 g cefazolin, and 80 mg gentamicin diluted in 500 mL of saline, is used to irrigate the breast implant pocket during surgery. We used in vitro and in vivo assays to test the efficacy of each antibiotic in TAPI, as well as TAPI at the concentration used during surgery. We found that planktonically grown S. aureus BIAI isolates displayed susceptibility to gentamicin, cefazolin, and TAPI. However, TAPI treatment enhanced biofilm formation of BIAI strains. Furthermore, we compared TAPI treatment of a S. aureus reference strain (JE2) to a BIAI isolate (117) in a mouse BIAI model. TAPI significantly reduced infection of JE2 at 1 and 7 days postinfection (dpi). In contrast, BIAI strain 117 displayed high bacterial burdens in tissues and implants, which persisted to 14 dpi despite TAPI treatment. Lastly, we demonstrated that TAPI was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa reference (PAO1) and BIAI strains in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data suggest that S. aureus BIAI strains employ unique mechanisms to resist antibiotic prophylaxis treatment and promote chronic infection. IMPORTANCE The incidence of breast implant associated infections (BIAIs) following reconstructive surgery postmastectomy remains high, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotic strategies. Thus, surgeons have begun using additional antibiotic-based prevention strategies, including triple antibiotic pocket irrigants (TAPIs). However, these strategies fail to reduce BIAI rates for these patients. To understand why these therapies fail, we assessed the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus strains, the most common cause of BIAI, to the antibiotics in TAPI (bacitracin, cefazolin, and gentamicin). We found that while clinically relevant BIAI isolates were more susceptible to the individual antibiotics compared to a reference strain, TAPI was effective at killing all the strains in vitro. However, in a mouse model, the BIAI isolates displayed recalcitrance to TAPI, which contrasted with the reference strain, which was susceptible. These data suggest that strains causing BIAI may encode specific recalcitrance mechanisms not present within reference strains.","Duran Ramirez J.M., Gomez J., Hanson B.M., Isa T., Myckatyn T.M., Walker J.N.",10.1128/spectrum.02884-22,Microbiology Spectrum
Evaluation Of Tpgs-Modified Thermo-Sensitive Pluronic Pf127 Hydrogel As A Potential Carrier To Reverse The Resistance Of P-Gp-Overexpressing Smmc-7721 Cell Lines,"In the present studies locally injectable docetaxel nanocrystals loaded d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate-modified Pluronic F127 (DOC-NCs-TPGS-PF127) thermo-sensitive hydrogels were prepared to reverse drug resistance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing human liver cancer SMMC-7721 tumors. Firstly, DOC nanosuspensions with mean particle size of 196nm were prepared and dispersed into series of mixed solutions containing PF127 and TPGS of different ratios to obtain DOC-NCs-TPGS-PF127 hydrogels. DOC NCs, exhibiting a uniform distribution and very good physical stability during three sol-gel cycles in the hydrogel network, did not influence the gelation temperature. Swelling-dependent release pattern was found for DOC NCs from hydrogels and release profiles could be well fitted by the Peppas equation. MTT test showed that hydrogels containing 0% or 0.1% TPGS had no cytotoxicity against L929 fibroblasts. Both DOC solution and DOC-NCs-TPGS-PF127 hydrogels exhibited obvious cytotoxicity against sensitive SMMC-7721 cells. When resistant SMMC7721 cells were treated, DOC-NCs-TPGS-PF127 hydrogels showed significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with DOC solution and hydrogels containing no TPGS (DOC-NCs-PF127), with markedly lower IC(50) and resistant index (RI). After intratumoral injection in SMMC-7721/RT tumor xenograft Balb/c mice model, DOC-NCs-TPGS-PF127 hydrogels exhibited about 5-fold increase and 1.8-fold increase in the inhibition rate of tumor growth compared with intravenous and intratumoral injection of DOC solution, respectively. It could be concluded that TPGS-modified PF127 thermo-sensitive hydrogel was an excellent locally injectable carrier to reverse P-gp overexpression associated multi-drug resistance.","Gao L., Wang X., Ma J., Hao D., Wei P., Zhou L., Liu G.",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.12.057,Colloids And Surfaces B: Biointerfaces
Aesthetic And Functional Outcomes Of Thinned Anterolateral Thigh Flap In Reconstruction Of Complex Wounds Of The Upper Limb,"We studied outcomes of reconstruction of complex upper limb wounds using thinned anterolateral thigh flaps. There were 18 patients with a mean age of 27.5 years. The mean thickness of the flap before and after thinning was 23 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Two patients had partial tip necrosis that was treated conservatively. Aesthetic and functional evaluations were performed using a 5-point Likert scale, QuickDASH score, passive range of motion and power grip at 12 months after surgery. The study showed good results in the aesthetic evaluation by a panel of plastic surgeons (mean score: 19.7) and patient self-assessment (mean score: 18.1). There was a significant correlation between the total scores of the panel and the patients. The mean QuickDASH score was 21, with a high percentage in the middle category 'had a problem but working'. The thinned anterolateral thigh flap is versatile and safe in upper limb reconstruction with good aesthetic and functional results.Level of evidence: IV.","Ellabban M.A., Gomaa A.A., Moghazy A.M., Elbadawy M.A., Adly O.A.",10.1177/1753193421989603,"The Journal Of Hand Surgery, European Volume"
Testing Cathelicidin Susceptibility Of Bacterial Mastitis Isolates: Technical Challenges And Data Output For Clinical Isolates,"Bovine mastitis caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Escherichia (E.) coli, is a major economic problem in dairy industry. In order to limit the presence of multi-resistant bacteria in bovine mastitis, alternatives for the treatment with antibiotics are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently been discussed as a potential new strategy against bacterial infections. They are key players in the innate immune system, as they can directly act against microorganisms or modulate the immune system. The aim of our study was to test S. aureus and E. coli mastitis isolates for their susceptibility to the bovine cathelicidins, BMAP-27 and BMAP-28. Susceptibility testing was performed in analogy to the broth microdilution criteria described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) to determine MICs of 50 clinical S. aureus and 50 clinical E. coli isolates for BMAP-27 and BMAP-28. Based on the repetitive testing of four well-selected reference strains, the homogeneity of MIC variances for each peptide as well as the effect of temperature, oxygen level and plastic polymers on MIC testing was determined. Statistical analysis revealed not only strong peptide-specific variances, but also strain-specific variances in the technical procedure. Finally, using this technique, susceptibility testing of the field isolates revealed statistically significant peptide-specific differences in the MICs. While BMAP-27 showed lower MICs for E. coli, BMAP-28 showed lower MICs for S. aureus. However, these results clearly illustrate the need of susceptibility testing of AMPs on several unrelated strains and not only on one selected test organism.","Langer M.N., Blodkamp S., Bayerbach M., Feßler A.T., De Buhr N., Gutsmann T., Kreienbrock L., Schwarz S., Von Köckritz-Blickwede M.",10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.08.022,Veterinary Microbiology
Cross-Platform Meta-Analysis Of Multiple Gene Expression Profiles Identifies Novel Expression Signatures In Acquired Anthracycline-Resistant Breast Cancer,"Anthracyclines are among the most effective and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. However, the development of acquired anthracycline resistance is a major limitation to their clinical application. The aim of the present study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological processes associated with the acquisition of anthracycline resistance in human breast cancer cells. We performed a meta-analysis of publically available microarray datasets containing data on stepwise-selected, anthracycline-resistant breast cancer cell lines using the RankProd package in R. Additionally, the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to analyze GO term enrichment and pathways, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also generated using Cytoscape software. The meta-analysis yielded 413 DEGs related to anthracycline resistance in human breast cancer cells, and 374 of these were not involved in individual DEGs. GO analyses showed the 413 genes were enriched with terms such as 'response to steroid metabolic process', 'chemical stimulus', 'external stimulus', 'hormone stimulus', 'multicellular organismal process', and 'system development'. Pathway analysis revealed significant pathways including steroid hormone biosynthesis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, and arachidonic acid metabolism. The PPI network indicated that proteins encoded by TRIM29, VTN, CCNA1, and karyopherin á 5 (KPNA5) participated in a significant number of interactions. In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive view of gene expression patterns associated with acquired resistance to anthracycline in breast cancer cells, and constitutes the basis for additional functional studies.","Lee Y.S., Ryu S.W., Bae S.J., Park T.H., Kwon K., Heenoh Y., Kim S.Y.",10.3892/or.2015.3810,Oncology Reports

Infections And Treatment Modalities In Pediatric Victims Of The Kahramanmaraş/Türkiye Earthquake,"Background: Data on infections in children are scarce in the context of earthquakes. Here, we describe our clinical experiences regarding infections in pediatric victims after the earthquakes in Kahramanmaraş/Türkiye. Methods: Trauma patients after the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes, aged under 18 years and admitted to our hospital, were evaluated retrospectively. The patients’ demographic data, pathogen distribution, drug resistance, and antibiotic treatments were analyzed. Results: Thirty pediatric patients were admitted to our hospital from disaster areas. The median duration under the rubble of patients was 24 h (range: 0.3–120 h). The median time for these patients to arrive our hospital was 5 days (range: 2–18 h). All of them had wound infections, 3.3% of patients had both wound infection and urinary tract infection, and 13.3% had both a bloodstream infection and a wound infection. Seventy-nine positive cultures were detected in repeated samples of 19 patients, of which polymicrobial infections accounted for 50.6% and monomicrobial infections constituted 49.4%. Of these, 107 were Gram-negative bacilli (79.9%), and 27 were Gram-positive cocci (20.1%). Pan-drug-resistant (PDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) possible PDR bacteria constituted 73.6% of total Gram-negative bacteria. Carbapenem-based treatments (n = 14, 46.7%) were the commonly preferred antimicrobial regimen. Fasciotomy was performed in 53.3% of the patients (n = 16) and amputation in 30% of the patients (n= 9). All of our patients survived. Conclusion: Factors that reduced mortality and morbidity in the earthquake victims were broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy targeting highly resistant bacteria, and complementary surgical management. In other words, the multidisciplinary approaches of pediatricians and surgical departments were life saving after the earthquake.","Aykac K., Uzumcugil A., Ustun G.G., Ilbay S., Ertekin E., Tuncdemir P., Anac E.G., Hazirolan G., Yilmaz G., Aksoy M.C., Saricaoglu F., Ozgur F.F., Cengiz A.B., Ozsurekci Y.",10.1111/ped.15827,Pediatrics International

The aim of our study was to identify the etiological spectrum of bacterial infections in severe burn patients in Romania and their multi-drug resistant patterns. We performed a prospective study that included 202 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Clinical Emergency Hospital of Plastic, Reconstructive Surgery and Burns, Bucharest, Romania (CEHPRSB), from 1 October 2018 to 1 April 2022, a period which includes the first 2 years of the outbreak of COVID-19. From each patient, wound swabs, endotracheal aspirates, blood for blood culture, and urine were collected. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (39%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12%), Klebsiella spp. (11%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (9%). More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were MDR, regardless of the clinical specimen from which they were isolated.","Nițescu B., Pițigoi D., Tălăpan D., Nițescu M., Aramă S.Ș., Pavel B., Streinu-Cercel A., Rafila A., Aramă V.",10.3390/medicina59061143,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
A Novel Hydrogel With Inherent Antibacterial And Hemostatic Properties For Burn Wound Healing,"The skin is the immune system's first line of defense. Extensive skin burns can lead to tissue necrosis, sepsis, and even death. Anti-infectious care of burn wounds is a major challenge in clinical medicine. However, the extensive use of antibiotics led to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and silver dressings with antibacterial effects are also cytotoxic. We used the natural cationic antibacterial agent ε-polylysine (EPL) to graft Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to synthesize EPL-EGCG. Then, we used methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) with arginine-glycine-aspartate-rich acid (RGD) sequence and EPL-EGCG form interpenetrating polymer network hydrogels with excellent swelling properties. The hydrogel's inherent antibacterial properties and photo-cross-linking properties can cover irregular burn wounds and isolate bacteria to prevent infection. In addition, we used polydopamine (PDA) to coat GelMA microspheres with excellent hemostatic efficacy and load platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to enhance the hemostatic efficacy of the microspheres and impart inflammation-regulating functions. The hydrogel showed excellent hemostatic efficacy in rat liver injury and tail vein injury models. In the rat infected burn model, the hydrogel exhibited favorable antimicrobial, pro-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory phenotype polarization of macrophages. Our study shows that GelMA/EPL-EGCG/GM-PDA@PRP hydrogel application has excellent antibacterial, hemostatic and anti-inflammatory effects, providing a new treatment strategy for wound care before burn skin grafting.","Chen X., Tang J., Dong Y., Xuan M., Tian Y., Liu Y., Peng N., Cheng B.",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2024.114250,Colloids And Surfaces B: Biointerfaces
"Safety And Efficacy Of A Phage, Kpssk3, In An In Vivo Model Of Carbapenem-Resistant Hypermucoviscous Klebsiella Pneumoniae Bacteremia","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most significant threats to global public health. As antibiotic failure is increasing, phages are gradually becoming important agents in the post-antibiotic era. In this study, the therapeutic effects and safety of kpssk3, a previously isolated phage infecting carbapenem-resistant hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-HMKP), were evaluated in a mouse model of systemic CR-HMKP infection. The therapeutic efficacy experiment showed that intraperitoneal injection with a single dose of phage kpssk3 (1 × 10(7) PFU/mouse) 3 h post infection protected 100% of BALB/c mice against bacteremia induced by intraperitoneal challenge with a 2 × LD(100) dose of NY03, a CR-HMKP clinical isolate. In addition, mice were treated with antibiotics from three classes (polymyxin B, tigecycline, and ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam), and the 7 days survival rates of the treated mice were 20, 20, and 90%, respectively. The safety test consisted of 2 parts: determining the cytotoxicity of kpssk3 and evaluating the short- and long-term impacts of phage therapy on the mouse gut microbiota. Phage kpssk3 was shown to not be cytotoxic to mammalian cells in vitro or in vivo. Fecal samples were collected from the phage-treated mice at 3 time points before (0 day) and after (3 and 10 days) phage therapy to study the change in the gut microbiome via high-throughput 16S rDNA sequence analysis, which revealed no notable alterations in the gut microbiota except for decreases in the Chao1 and ACE indexes.","Shi Y., Peng Y., Zhang Y., Chen Y., Zhang C., Luo X., Chen Y., Yuan Z., Chen J., Gong Y.",10.3389/fmicb.2021.613356,Frontiers In Microbiology
Double-Bundle Medial Collateral Ligament Reconstruction Improves Anteromedial Rotatory Instability,"BACKGROUND: New techniques have been proposed to better address anteromedial rotatory instability in a medial collateral ligament (MCL)-injured knee that require an extra graft and more surgical implants, which might not be feasible in every clinical setting. PURPOSE: To investigate if improved resistance to anteromedial rotatory instability can be achieved by using a single-graft, double-bundle (DB) MCL reconstruction with a proximal fixation more anteriorly on the tibia, in comparison with the gold standard single-bundle (SB) MCL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were tested using a 6 degrees of freedom robotic simulator in intact knee, superficial MCL/deep MCL-deficient, and reconstruction states. Three different reconstructions were tested: DB MCL no proximal tibial fixation and DB and SB MCL reconstruction with proximal tibial fixation. Knee kinematics were recorded at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion for the following measurements: 8 N·m of valgus rotation (VR), 5 N·m of external tibial rotation, 5 N·m of internal tibial rotation, combined 89 N of anterior tibial translation and 5 N·m of external rotation for anteromedial rotation (AMR) and anteromedial translation (AMT). The differences between each state for every measurement were analyzed with VR and AMR/AMT as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Cutting the superficial MCL/deep MCL increased VR and AMR/AMT in all knee positions except at 90° for VR (P < .05). All reconstructions restored VR to the intact state except at 90° of knee flexion (P < .05). The DB MCL no proximal tibial fixation reconstruction could not restore intact AMR/AMT kinematics in any knee position (P < .05). Adding an anterior-based proximal tibial fixation restored intact AMR/AMT kinematics at ≥30° of knee flexion except at 90° for AMT (P < .05). The SB MCL reconstruction could not restore intact AMR/AMT kinematics at 0° and 90° of knee flexion (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In this in vitro cadaveric study, a DB MCL reconstruction with anteriorly placed proximal tibial fixation was able to control AMR and AMT better than the gold standard SB MCL reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with anteromedial rotatory instability and valgus instability, a DB MCL reconstruction may be superior to the SB MCL reconstruction, without causing extra surgical morbidity or additional costs.","Beel W., Vivacqua T., Willing R., Getgood A.",10.1177/03635465241251463,The American Journal Of Sports Medicine
Seasonal Variation In Hand And Upper Limb Soft Tissue Infections,"Background: Hand and upper limb soft tissue infections result in significant disability and loss of productivity. Many infections have been shown to follow a seasonal variation, however little is known about this is the context of upper limb soft tissue infections. We aimed to evaluate seasonal variation in acute bacterial, hand and upper limb skin and soft-tissue infections, and correlate findings with key environmental variables. Methods: Hand and upper limb soft tissue infection cases from 2006-2016 were retrieved from a single UK center. Cases were reviewed for microbiology culture and sensitivity. Correlation between cases and season, temperature and humidity was assessed. Results: 206 cases were identified for inclusion. Specimens were sent for microbiology in 76.4% of cases. Of these 78.9% were culture positive, 47.6% exhibited antibiotic resistance and 16.9% were multi-resistant. There was a significant difference between season and culture positive cases, with significantly more culture positive cases in the summer vs. winter on post-hoc analysis (p = 0.004). There was a significant positive correlation between higher temperatures and number of culture positive cases (r = 0.75). There was no significant correlation between temperature and antibiotic resistance (r = 0.5) or between humidity and culture positive cases (r =-0.42). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a seasonal variation in hand and upper limb infections, with a significant correlation between infection rates and ambient temperature. Appreciating seasonal variability of these infections could prove beneficial for surgical planning, public health recommendations and antibiotic guidelines. However, further international data is needed to understand potential mechanisms involved.","Miller R., Pywell S., Chan J., Mccluney S., Halsey T.",10.1142/S2424835519500255,Journal Of Hand Surgery Asian-Pacific Volume
Bacterial 'Grounded' Prophages: Hotspots For Genetic Renovation And Innovation,"Bacterial genomes are highly plastic allowing the generation of variants through mutations and acquisition of genetic information. The fittest variants are then selected by the econiche thereby allowing the bacterial adaptation and colonization of the habitat. Larger genomes, however, may impose metabolic burden and hence bacterial genomes are optimized by the loss of frivolous genetic information. The activity of temperate bacteriophages has acute consequences on the bacterial population as well as the bacterial genome through lytic and lysogenic cycles. Lysogeny is a selective advantage as the prophage provides immunity to the lysogen against secondary phage attack. Since the non-lysogens are eliminated by the lytic phages, lysogens multiply and colonize the habitat. Nevertheless, all lysogens have an imminent risk of lytic cycle activation and cell lysis. However, a mutation in the attachment sites or in the genes that encode the specific recombinase responsible for prophage excision could result in 'grounding' of the prophage. Since the lysogens with grounded prophage are immune to respective phage infection as well as dodge the induction of lytic cycle, we hypothesize that the selection of these mutant lysogens is favored relative to their normal lysogenic counterparts. These grounded prophages offer several advantages to the bacterial genome evolution through propensity for genetic variations including inversions, deletions, and insertions via horizontal gene transfer. We propose that the grounded prophages expedite bacterial genome evolution by acting as 'genetic buffer zones' thereby increasing the frequency as well as the diversity of variations on which natural selection favors the beneficial variants. The grounded prophages are also hotspots for horizontal gene transfer wherein several ecologically significant genes such as those involved in stress tolerance, antimicrobial resistance, and novel metabolic pathways, are integrated. Moreover, the high frequency of genetic changes within prophages also allows proportionate probability for the de novo genesis of genetic information. Through sequence analyses of well-characterized E. coli prophages we exemplify various roles of grounded prophages in E. coli ecology and evolution. Therefore, the temperate prophages are one of the most significant drivers of bacterial genome evolution and sites of biogenesis of genetic information.","Ramisetty B.C.M., Sudhakari P.A.",10.3389/fgene.2019.00065,Frontiers In Genetics
"Microbiology Of Facial Skin Infections—Strains, Susceptibility, And Therapeutic Consequences","Background: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common conditions with severe and potentially life-threatening outcomes. However, the use of antibiotics to treat these infections is controversial. Purpose: This study was to identify the microorganisms responsible for facial SSTIs, their antibiotic sensitivities, and the therapeutic outcomes of treatment. Study design, setting, and sample: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study conducted at a single oral and maxillofacial plastic surgery department. The study sample included 103 patients with facial SSTIs (61 men, 42 women) with a mean age of 41.8 years (standard deviation ± 20.4). Predictor/exposure/independent variables: The predictor variables included patient characteristics, antibiotic use before the clinic visit, and the infection's site and origin. Main outcome variable(s): The primary outcome variable was the presence of antibiotic resistance in the bacterial strains isolated from the infections. Methods: The data were collected by reviewing the results of microbiological swabs and patient records obtained from patients with facial SSTIs. Categorical variables were described using absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation. The association between antibiotic resistance and the predictor variables was analyzed using Pearson's χ(2) test and student's t test. Results: The most common cause of SSTI was an infected epidermal cyst (60.1%). Of all the microorganisms identified, 80.6% were Gram-positive, and 55.8% showed antibiotic resistance against one or more of the evaluated antibiotics, including several backup antibiotics. There were no identified risk factors that significantly influenced the probability of resistance, and there were no adverse events observed. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that surgery should be the primary approach for treating SSTIs, as antibiotic administration may not be effective due to the unknown susceptibility of the causative strains. Antibiotics should be reserved for severe cases and high-risk patients, and if deemed necessary for SSTI management, a broad-spectrum antibiotic should be administered to cover resistant organisms.","Warwas F.B., Klausing A., Nentwig-Tschürtz K., Berger M., Kramer F.-J., Heim N.",10.1016/j.joms.2022.12.021,Journal Of Oral And Maxillofacial Surgery
Analysis Of Drug Resistance Of Acinetobacter Baumannii In Wound Of Children With Traffic Injury And Its Relationship With Antibiotic Use,"Objective: To know the drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) in wound of children with traffic injury and its relationship with antibiotic use. Methods: Wound exudate of 226 children with traffic injury admitted to our unit from January 2010 to December 2015 were collected. API bacteria identification panels and fully automatic microbiological identification system were used to identify pathogens. Kirby-Bauer paper disk diffusion method was used to detect the drug resistance of pathogens to 18 antibiotics including amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, and imipenem. The detection situation of pathogen of children's wounds and drug resistance of detected AB to 18 antibiotics in each year were collected. Forty-six AB positive children (2 children excluded) were divided into imipenem-resistant group (IR, n=19) and non imipenem-resistant group (NIR, n=25) according to whether AB was 100% resistant to imipenem. Drug resistance of AB in wounds of children to 18 antibiotics in two groups was compared. The antibiotic use of AB positive children was collected, and the antibiotic use intensity of children in two groups was compared. Data were processed with Fisher's exact test, independent sample t test, and corrected t test. Results: (1) The detection rates of pathogen in wounds of children in 2010-2015 were 95.6% (43/45), 89.8% (53/59), 81.3% (148/182), 81.1% (107/132), 81.6% (120/147), and 77.5% (62/80), respectively, showing a trend of decreasing year by year. A total of 665 strains and 75 pathogens were detected, and the top 5 pathogens with detection rate from high to low were AB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, respectively. (2) Drug resistance rates of AB to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, aztreonam, and piperacillin were all 100%, while AB was 100% sensitive to polymyxin, and the total drug resistance rates of AB to the other 13 antibiotics were all above 50%. The drug resistance rate of AB in wounds of children to piperacillin was higher than that to piperacillin/tazobactam in 2010-2015. (3) Except for imipenem, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, aztreonam, piperacillin, and polymyxin, the drug resistance rates of AB in wounds of children in group IR to the other 12 antibiotics were higher than those in group NIR (with P values below 0.01). Besides, AB strains in wounds of children in group IR were completely resistant to at least 3 kinds of antibiotics including carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, so that they were multidrug-resistant AB. (4) A total of 32 antibiotics were used in 46 AB positive children, and the 10-top-used antibiotics with use intensity from high to low were cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, imipenem, ceftizoxime, amoxycillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, amoxycillin/sulbactam, and cefmetazole, respectively. (5) Twenty-one antibiotics were not included in the comparison because of their small amount of usage. For the other 11 antibiotics, only the use intensity of metronidazole of children in two groups was statistically different (t=-3.104, P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in total antibiotic use of children in two groups (t=0.368, P>0.05). Conclusions: AB is one of the main pathogens in wounds of children with traffic injury, with high drug resistant rate. The high intensity of antibiotic use may lead to its drug resistance. In this study, the top-used antibiotics were in accord with AB resistant drugs, indicating a lack of normative use of antibiotics.","Liu S., Wang C., Fu Y.X.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2017.07.002,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns
The Travelling Particles: Investigating Microplastics As Possible Transport Vectors For Multidrug Resistant E. Coli In The Weser Estuary (Germany),"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in aquatic environments has been a long withstanding health concern, namely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. Given increasing reports on microplastic (MP) pollution in these environments, it has become crucial to better understand the role of MP particles as transport vectors for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed where particles of both synthetic and natural material (HDPE, tyre wear, and wood) were sequentially incubated at multiple sites along a salinity gradient from the Lower Weser estuary (Germany) to the offshore island Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). Following each incubation period, particle biofilms and water samples were assessed for ESBL-producing E. coli, first by the enrichment and detection of E. coli using Fluorocult® LMX Broth followed by cultivation on CHROMAgar™ ESBL media to select for ESBL-producers. Results showed that general E. coli populations were present on the surfaces of wood particles across all sites but none were found to produce ESBLs. Additionally, neither HDPE nor tyre wear particles were found to harbour any E. coli. Conversely, ESBL-producing E. coli were present in surrounding waters from all sites, 64% of which conferred resistances against up to 3 other antibiotic groups, additional to the beta-lactam resistances intrinsic to ESBL-producers. This study provides a first look into the potential of MP to harbour and transport multidrug-resistant E. coli across different environments and the approach serves as an important precursor to further studies on other potentially harmful MP-colonizing species.","Song J., Jongmans-Hochschulz E., Mauder N., Imirzalioglu C., Wichels A., Gerdts G.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137603,Science Of The Total Environment
Amer'S Classification Of Territories Of Facial Nerve Injury In Early Cases And Strategies For The Management Of Different Territories,"Early cases of facial nerve injury are best treated by restoring the neural pathway to the same existing facial muscles. Knowledge of the exact territory of facial nerve injury is required to design a plane for the reconstruction of these injuries and to compare results. The current study aims to design a classification system for territories of facial nerve injury based on the location of nearest healthy fascicles to the site of injury both proximally and distally. Two hundred-one patients with early facial nerve injury were assessed for treatment. According to the results of the exploration, 13 territories of injury were identified. The management strategy was planned according to the territory of injury. The current classification system is a simple, easy and effective method for the classification of territories of facial nerve injury. The classification system accurately describes the nearest possible healthy proximal and distal fascicles and can be employed to easily report cases and implement a management plan. This classification scheme also allows us to more effectively compare results.","Amer T.A., El Kholy M.S., Khalaf A.A., Rifky A.M.",10.1016/j.bjps.2020.05.100,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
Effects Of Discarded Masks On The Offshore Microorganisms During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"Numerous disposable plastic masks had been produced and used for preventing the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic effectively. Discarded masks are a potential source of microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems. The effect of discarded masks on offshore microorganisms is still unclear. Herein, we profiled the interaction between the microplastics released by discarded masks and marine microbes. The effects of mask quantity, time, and environment on the microplastic-related communities were determined. We characterized the bacterial communities of each group using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing and correlated the community diversity to the physicochemical properties of seawater. We found that the diversity and richness of microflora on the surface of microplastics with different quantity and time varied significantly. Proteobacteria are the main bacteria on microplastics, and the KEGG metabolic pathway prediction shows that amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were abundant. In addition, there was a correlation between bacterial communities and Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO). We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques to evaluate the plastic polymer characteristics of disposable medical masks. Our research shows that disposable medical masks immersed in seawater can alter the microbial community. This study provides the most recent data and insights into the contamination of discarded masks in the marine environment.","Liao J., Ji S., Chi Y.",10.3390/toxics10080426,Toxics
3D-Fibroblast Tissues Constructed By A Cell-Coat Technology Enhance Tight-Junction Formation Of Human Colon Epithelial Cells,"Caco-2, human colon carcinoma cell line, has been widely used as a model system for intestinal epithelial permeability because Caco-2 cells express tight-junctions, microvilli, and a number of enzymes and transporters characteristic of enterocytes. However, the functional differentiation and polarization of Caco-2 cells to express sufficient tight-junctions (a barrier) usually takes over 21 days in culture. This may be due to the cell culture environment, for example inflammation induced by plastic petri dishes. Three-dimensional (3D) sufficient cell microenvironments similar to in vivo natural conditions (proteins and cells), will promote rapid differentiation and higher functional expression of tight junctions. Herein we report for the first time an enhancement in tight-junction formation by 3D-cultures of Caco-2 cells on monolayered (1L) and eight layered (8L) normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Trans epithelial electric resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells was enhanced in the 3D-cultures, especially 8L-NHDF tissues, depending on culture times and only 10 days was enough to reach the same TEER value of Caco-2 monolayers after a 21 day incubation. Relative mRNA expression of tight-junction proteins of Caco-2 cells on 3D-cultures showed higher values than those in monolayer structures. Transporter gene expression patterns of Caco-2 cells on 3D-constructs were almost the same as those of Caco-2 monolayers, suggesting that there was no effect of 3D-cultures on transporter protein expression. The expression correlation between carboxylesterase 1 and 2 in 3D-cultures represented similar trends with human small intestines. The results of this study clearly represent a valuable application of 3D-Caco-2 tissues for pharmaceutical applications.","Matsusaki M., Hikimoto D., Nishiguchi A., Kadowaki K., Ohura K., Imai T., Akashi M.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.12.118,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein-1 (Mrp-1)-Dependent Glutathione Disulfide (Gssg) Efflux As A Critical Survival Factor For Oxidant-Enriched Tumorigenic Endothelial Cells,"Endothelial cell tumors are the most common soft tissue tumors in infants. Tumor-forming endothelial (EOMA) cells are able to escape cell death fate despite excessive nuclear oxidant burden. Our previous work recognized perinuclear Nox-4 as a key contributor to EOMA growth. The objective of this work was to characterize the mechanisms by whichEOMAcells evade oxidant toxicity and thrive. In EOMA cells, compared with in the cytosol, the nuclear GSSG/GSH ratio was 5-fold higher. Compared to the ratio observed in healthy murine aortic endothelial (MAE) cells, GSSG/GSH was over twice as high inEOMA cells. Multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP-1), an active GSSG efflux mechanism, showed 2-fold increased activity inEOMAcompared withMAEcells. Hyperactive YB-1 and Ape/ Ref-1 were responsible for high MRP-1 expression in EOMA. Proximity ligand assay demonstrated MRP-1 and YB-1 binding. Such binding enabled the nuclear targeting of MRP-1 in EOMA in a leptomycin-B-sensitive manner.MRP-1inhibition as well as knockdown trapped nuclear GSSG, causing cell death of EOMA. Disulfide loading of cells by inhibition of GSSG reductase (bischoloronitrosourea) or thioredoxin reductase (auranofin) was effective in causing EOMA death as well. In sum, EOMA cells survive a heavy oxidant burden by rapid efflux of GSSG, which is lethal if trapped within the cell. A hyperactive MRP-1 system for GSSG efflux acts as a critical survival factor for these cells, making it a potential target for EOMA therapeutics.","Gordillo G.M., Biswas A., Khanna S., Spieldenner J.M., Pan X., Sen C.K.",10.1074/jbc.M115.688879,Journal Of Biological Chemistry
Interleukin-18 Down-Regulates Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2 Expression Through Farnesoid X Receptor Associated With Nuclear Factor Kappa B And Yin Yang 1 In Human Hepatoma Hepg2 Cells,"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) plays an important role in bile acid metabolism by transporting toxic organic anion conjugates, including conjugated bilirubin, glutathione, sulfate, and multifarious drugs. MRP2 expression is reduced in cholestatic patients and rodents. However, the molecular mechanism of MRP2 down-regulation remains elusive. In this report, we treated human hepatoma HepG2 cells with interleukin-18 (IL-18) and measured the expression of MRP2, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) by quantitative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting. We found that expression of MRP2 was repressed by IL-18 at both the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-and time dependent manner. Furthermore, the activated NF-κB pathway increased YY1 and reduced FXR. These changes were all attenuated in HepG2 cells with knockdown of the NF-κB subunit, p65. The reduced expression of FXR and MRP2 in HepG2 cells that had been caused by IL-18 treatment was also attenuated by YY1 knockdown. We further observed significantly elevated IL-18, NF-κB, and YY1 expression and decreased FXR and MRP2 expression in bile duct-ligated Sprague Dawley rat livers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also showed that FXR bound to the promoter region in MRP2 was less abundant in liver extracts from bile duct-ligated rats than sham-operated rats. Our findings indicate that IL-18 down-regulates MRP2 expression through the nuclear receptor FXR in HepG2 cells, and may be mediated by NF-κB and YY1.

Charge Reversible Hyaluronic Acid-Modified Dendrimer-Based Nanoparticles For Simdr-1 And Doxorubicin Co-Delivery,"Dendrimer-based nanoparticles have shown promising applications in delivery of small interference RNA (siRNA) to downregulate proteins that contribute to multidrug resistance (MDR). Various types of modification can further enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of dendrimer-based nanoparticles. In this study, generation 4 polyamodoamine (PAMAM) was conjugated with PEG(2k)-DOPE. The PAMAM-PEG(2k)-DOPE co-polymer, together with mPEG(2k)-DOPE, was formulated into mixed dendrimer micelles (MDMs) that can complex siRNA through the cationic PAMAM moieties and encapsulate hydrophobic drug in the micellar lipid cores. DOPE-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) was coated on the surface of MDMs to shield the exposed positive charge on PAMAM and to increase the cellular association with CD44(+) cancer cells. The HA-modified MDMs could form stable complexes with siRNA, prevent RNase-mediated siRNA degradation and maintain its integrity. Cellular association and cytotoxicity of HA-modified MDMs were investigated in A2780 ADR, MDA-MB-231 and HCT 116 cell lines. The HA-modified MDMs alleviated the toxicity from cationic charge, increase the cancer cell specificity and enhance the cancer cell killing effect in CD44(+) cell line.","Zhang X., Pan J., Yao M., Palmerston Mendes L., Sarisozen C., Mao S., Torchilin V.P.",10.1016/j.ejpb.2020.06.019,European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics
Application Of Miniaturized Most Probable Number Method For Bacterial Detection In Water Samples: Detection Of Multi-Drug-Resistant Ralstonia Insidiosa In Drinking Water,"The detection of bacterial contamination in drinking water is essential for monitoring the spread of foodborne diseases. We developed a simple, portable, and low-cost method of mini most probable number (mini MPN) to semi-enumerate bacterial suspension in water as a drinking water analogue. In this study, there is no significant difference between mini MPN and the standard method, technique plate count (TPC), at 10 and 100 CFU/ml Klebsiella pneumoniae suspension with a P-value of 0.28. For the ease-of-use aspect of this method, we tested several variables to prove it can be mass-applied in society. The usage of a sterile-plastic pipette, sample inoculation conducted in a biosafety cabinet (BSC), the usage of a 3-month storage medium, and incubation temperature conducted at room temperature compared to aseptic standard laboratory technique showed P-value.0.05. In a trial for this method, we used commercialized drinking water for bacterial enumeration and characterization. We found multi-drug resistant (MDR) Ralstonia insidiosa which was resistant to at least four antimicrobial classes, including aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalosporin, and carbapenem. Vitek 2 Compact was used for bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A virulence test in Omphisa fuscidentalis larvae showed R. insidiosa strain D had a low virulence.","Ilsan N.A., Nurfajriah S., Inggraini M., Krishanti N.P.R.A., Yunita M., Sipriyadi, Anindita R., Huang T.-W.",10.2166/wh.2024.086,Journal Of Water And Health
Structural Requirement Of Ha5G18 Peptide (Ddfvfyvggyps) From Laminin Α5 Chain For Amyloid-Like Fibril Formation And Cell Adhesion,"The hA5G18 peptide (DDFVFYVGGYPS) identified from the human laminin α5 chain G domain promotes cell attachment and spreading when directly coated on a plastic plate, but does not show activity when it is conjugated on a chitosan matrix. Here, we focused on the structural requirement of hA5G18 for activity. hA5G18 was stained with Congo red and formed amyloid-like fibrils. A deletion analysis of hA5G18 revealed that FVFYV was a minimum active sequence for the formation of amyloid-like fibrils, but FVFYV did not promote cell attachment. Next, we designed functional fibrils using FVFYV as a template for amyloid-like fibrils. When we conjugated an integrin binding sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to the FVFYV peptide with Gly-Gly (GG) as a spacer, FVFYVGGRGD promoted cell attachment in a plate coat assay, but a negative control sequence RGE conjugated peptide, FVFYVGGRGE, also showed activity. However, when the peptides were conjugated to Sepharose beads, the FVFYVGGRGD beads showed cell attachment activity, but the FVFYVGGRGE beads did not. These results suggest that RGD and RGE similarly contribute to cell attachment activity in amyloid-like fibrils, but only RGD contributes the activity on the Sepharose beads. Further, we conjugated a basic amino acid (Arg, Lys, and His) to the FVFYV peptide. Arg or Lys-conjugated FVFYV peptides, FVFYVGGR and FVFYVGGK, showed cell attachment activity when they were coated on a plate, but a His-conjugated FVFYV peptide FVFYVGGH did not show activity. None of the basic amino acid-conjugated peptides showed cell attachment in a Sepharose bead assay. The cell attachment and spreading on FVFYVGGR and FVFYVGGK were inhibited by an anti-integrin β1 antibody. These results suggest that the Arg and Lys residues play critical roles in the interaction with integrins in amyloid-like fibrils. FVFYV is useful to use as a template for amyloid-like fibrils and to develop multi-functional biomaterials.","Zhang G., Yamada Y., Kumai J., Hamada K., Kikkawa Y., Nomizu M.",10.3390/molecules27196610,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)"
"Mobile Colistin-Resistant Genes Mcr-1, Mcr-2, And Mcr-3 Identified In Diarrheal Pathogens Among Infants, Children, And Adults In Bangladesh: Implications For The Future","Colistin is a last-resort antimicrobial for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Phenotypic colistin resistance is highly associated with plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes. mcr-bearing Enterobacteriaceae have been detected in many countries, with the emergence of colistin-resistant pathogens a global concern. This study assessed the distribution of mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, and mcr-5 genes with phenotypic colistin resistance in isolates from diarrheal infants and children in Bangladesh. Bacteria were identified using the API-20E biochemical panel and 16s rDNA gene sequencing. Polymerase chain reactions detected mcr gene variants in the isolates. Their susceptibilities to colistin were determined by agar dilution and E-test by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. Over 31.6% (71/225) of isolates showed colistin resistance according to agar dilution assessment (MIC > 2 μg/mL). Overall, 15.5% of isolates carried mcr genes (7, mcr-1; 17, mcr-2; 13, and mcr-3, with co-occurrence occurring in two isolates). Clinical breakout MIC values (≥4 μg/mL) were associated with 91.3% of mcr-positive isolates. The mcr-positive pathogens included twenty Escherichia spp., five Shigella flexneri, five Citrobacter spp., two Klebsiella pneumoniae, and three Pseudomonas parafulva. The mcr-genes appeared to be significantly associated with phenotypic colistin resistance phenomena (p = 0.000), with 100% colistin-resistant isolates showing MDR phenomena. The age and sex of patients showed no significant association with detected mcr variants. Overall, mcr-associated colistin-resistant bacteria have emerged in Bangladesh, which warrants further research to determine their spread and instigate activities to reduce resistance.","Sarker S., Neeloy R.M., Habib M.B., Urmi U.L., Al Asad M., Mosaddek A.S.M., Khan M.R.K., Nahar S., Godman B., Islam S.",10.3390/antibiotics13060534,Antibiotics
Characteristics Of Tetracycline Antibiotic Resistance Gene Enrichment And Migration In Soil-Plant System,"Tetracycline Resistance Genes (TRGs) have received widespread attention in recent years, as they are a novel environmental pollutant that can rapidly accumulate and migrate in soil plant systems through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), posing a potential threat to food safety and public health. This article systematically reviews the pollution sources, enrichment, and migration characteristics of TRGs in soil. The main sources of TRGs include livestock manure and contaminated wastewater, especially in intensive farming environments where TRGs pollution is more severe. In soil, TRGs diffuse horizontally between bacteria and migrate to plant tissues through mechanisms such as plasmid conjugation, integron mediation, and phage transduction. The migration of TRGs is not limited to the soil interior, and increasing evidence suggests that they can also enter the plant system through plant root absorption and the HGT pathway of endophytic bacteria, ultimately accumulating in plant roots, stems, leaves, fruits, and other parts. This process has a direct impact on human health, especially when TRGs are found in crops such as vegetables, which may be transmitted to the human body through the food chain. In addition, this article also deeply analyzed various factors that affect the migration of TRGs, including the residual level of tetracycline in soil, the type and concentration of microorganisms, heavy metal pollution, and the presence of new pollutants such as microplastics. These factors significantly affect the enrichment rate and migration mode of TRGs in soil. In addition, two technologies that can effectively eliminate TRGs in livestock breeding environments were introduced, providing reference for healthy agricultural production. The article concludes by summarizing the shortcomings of current research on TRGs, particularly the limited understanding of TRG migration pathways and their impact mechanisms. Future research should focus on revealing the migration mechanisms of TRGs in soil plant systems and developing effective control and governance measures to reduce the environmental transmission risks of TRGs and ensure the safety of ecosystems and human health.","Wang L., Yu L., Cai B.",10.1007/s10653-024-02239-1,Environmental Geochemistry And Health
Microplastic Pollution Increases Gene Exchange In Aquatic Ecosystems,"Pollution by microplastics in aquatic ecosystems is accumulating at an unprecedented scale, emerging as a new surface for biofilm formation and gene exchange. In this study, we determined the permissiveness of aquatic bacteria towards a model antibiotic resistance plasmid, comparing communities that form biofilms on microplastics vs. those that are free-living. We used an exogenous and red-fluorescent E. coli donor strain to introduce the green-fluorescent broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5 which encodes for trimethoprim resistance. We demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with microplastics compared to bacteria that are free-living or in natural aggregates. Moreover, comparison of communities grown on polycarbonate filters showed that increased gene exchange occurs in a broad range of phylogenetically-diverse bacteria. Our results indicate horizontal gene transfer in this habitat could distinctly affect the ecology of aquatic microbial communities on a global scale. The spread of antibiotic resistance through microplastics could also have profound consequences for the evolution of aquatic bacteria and poses a neglected hazard for human health. Increased horizontal gene transfer via microplastic particles.","Arias-Andres M., Klümper U., Rojas-Jimenez K., Grossart H.-P.",10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.058,Environmental Pollution
The Emergence Of Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa In Cystic Fibrosis Patients On Inhaled Antibiotics,"Introduction: Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) is an important and growing issue in the care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Objective: The objective of the study was to describe the frequency of MDR-PA recovered from the lower respiratory samples of pediatric and adult CF patients, and its antibiotic resistance pattern to commonly used antimicrobial agents including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Materials and Methods: The lower respiratory isolates of P. aeruginosa were obtained from inpatients and outpatients CF clinics from a tertiary care teaching hospital for the period from October 2014 to September 2015. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility for all the isolates were performed by using the BD Phoenix™ and E-test in compliance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: A total of 61 P. aeruginosa samples were isolated from thirty CF patients from twenty families. Twelve sputum samples were positive for MDR-PA (seven nonmucoid and five mucoid isolates) from five CF patients (five families) with moderate-to-very severe lung disease given MDR-PA frequency of 19.7%. The median age of the study group was 20 (range 10-30) years. Three CF patients were on chronic inhaled tobramycin and two on nebulized colistin. The antimicrobial patterns of isolates MDR-PA showed the highest rate of resistance toward each gentamycin, amikacin, and cefepime (100%), followed by 91.7% to ciprofloxacin, 75% to tobramycin, 58.3% to meropenem, and 50% to piperacillin-tazobactam. None of the isolates were resistant to colistin during the study period. Conclusion: The study results emphasize that the emergence of a significant problem in the clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa in CF patients that dictate appropriate attention to the antibiotic management after proper surveillance.","Abdulwahab A., Zahraldin K., Sid Ahmed M.A., Jarir S.A., Muneer M., Mohamed S.F., Hamid J.M., Hassan A.A.I., Ibrahim E.B.",10.4103/lungindia.lungindia_39_17,Lung India
Ameliorative Effect Of Ginseng Extract On Phthalate And Bisphenol A Reprotoxicity During Pregnancy In Rats,"Phthalates (such as DEHP) and bisphenol A (BPA) are widely used chemicals in plastics manufacturing and exert public health concerns as endocrine disrupters. This study was designed to investigate the deleterious effect of DEHP and BPA on endocrine profile of pregnant female rats and the combined treatment with ginseng extract (Panax ginseng). Seventy-two pregnant rats were divided into six groups (control, ginseng, DEHP, BPA, Gin + DEHP, and Gin + BPA), 12 females per each group. The drugs were supplemented from pregnancy day 0 until day 20. Determination of serum sex hormones (testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol) were determined on days 4, 10, and 20 of pregnancy. mRNA transcripts of STAR, HSD17B3, CYP17, AKT1, and PTEN were relatively quantified against ACTB in the ovary and placenta of days 10 and 20 pregnant females by relative quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (RQ-PCR). DEHP and BPA significantly decreased the endocrine profile of testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol of days 10 and 20 of pregnant females. Combined administration of these chemicals along with ginseng extracts has returned the hormones to normal levels when compared with the control group. The ovarian and placental CYP17 and HSD17B3 mRNA transcripts showed variable expression pattern in both tissues and they were significantly affected by DEHP and BPA administration, concomitantly correlating to STAR, AKT1, PTEN, progesterone, and testosterone levels on pregnancy days 10 and 20. The results confirm the reprotoxicity of DEHP and BPA as endocrine disruptors and indicate that ginseng could be used to alleviate the toxic effects of these chemicals.","Saadeldin I.M., Hussein M.A., Suleiman A.H., Abohassan M.G., Ahmed M.M., Moustafa A.A., Moumen A.F., Abdel-Aziz Swelum A.",10.1007/s11356-018-2299-1,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Analysis Of The Risk Factors For Plastic Bronchitis In Children With Severe Adenovirus Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study,"Purpose: Plastic bronchitis (PB), a rare complication of respiratory infection characterized by the formation of casts in the tracheobronchial tree, can lead to airway obstruction and severe condition. Adenovirus is one of the common pathogens of PB caused by infection. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and risk factors for PB in children with severe adenovirus pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective study of children with severe adenovirus pneumonia with bronchoscopy results at Guangzhou Women and Children’s Hospital between January 2018 and January 2020 was performed. Based on bronchoscopy, we divided children with severe adenovirus pneumonia into two groups: PB and non-PB. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for PB in patients with severe adenovirus pneumonia after univariate analysis. Results: Our study examined 156 patients with severe adenovirus pneumonia with bronchoscopy results in hospital. Among them, 18 developed PB and 138 did not. On multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors of PB in children with severe adenovirus pneumonia were history of allergies (OR 10.147, 95% CI 1.727–59.612; P=0.010), diminished breath sounds (OR 12.856, 95% CI 3.259–50.713; P=0.001), and increased proportion of neutrophils (>70%; OR 8.074, 95% CI 1.991–32.735; P=0.003). Conclusion: Children with severe adenovirus pneumonia with a history of allergies, diminished breath sounds, and increased the proportion of neutrophils >70% may show higher risk of PB.","Xu X.-H., Cai J.-R., Fan H.-F., Shi T.-T., Yang D.-Y., Huang L., Zhang D.-W., Lu G.",10.2147/IDR.S452347,Infection And Drug Resistance

Crispri-Mediated Gene Suppression Reveals Putative Reverse Transcriptase Gene Pa0715 To Be A Global Regulator Of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Purpose: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen of infection in burn and trauma patients, and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa has become an increasingly important pathogen. Essential genes are key to the development of novel antibiotics. The PA0715 gene is a novel unidentified essential gene that has attracted our interest as a potential antibiotic target. Our study aims to determine the exact role of PA0715 in cell physiology and bacterial pathogenicity, providing important clues for antibiotic development. Patients and Methods: The shuttle vector pHERD20T containing an arabinose inducible promoter was used to construct the CRISPRi system. Alterations in cellular physiology and bacterial pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 after PA0715 inhibition were characterized. High-throughput RNA-seq was performed to gain more insight into the mechanisms by which PA0715 regulates the vital activity of P. aeruginosa. Results: We found that down-regulation of PA0715 significantly reduced PAO1 growth rate, motility and chemotaxis, antibiotic resistance, pyocyanin and biofilm production. In addition, PA0715 inhibition reduced the pathogenicity of PAO1 to the greater galleria mellonella larvae. Transcriptional profiling identified 1757 genes including those related to amino acid, carbohydrate, ketone body and organic salt metabolism, whose expression was directly or indirectly controlled by PA0715. Unexpectedly, genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation also varied with PA0715 levels, and these findings support a hitherto unrecognized critical role for PA0715 in oxidative respiration in P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: We identified PA0715 as a global regulator of the metabolic network that is indispensable for the survival and reproduction of P. aeruginosa. Our results provide a basis for future studies of potential antibiotic targets for P. aeruginosa and offer new ideas for P. aeruginosa infection control.","Zhou D., Huang G., Xu G., Xiang L., Huang S., Chen X., Zhang Y., Wang D.",10.2147/IDR.S384980,Infection And Drug Resistance
A Single Center Study On Antimicrobial Use And Bacterial Resistance In Burn Ward,"Objective: To investigate the effect of antibiotics on bacterial resistance through analyzing the use of common antibiotics and the bacterial prevalence in single-center burn ward. Methods: The epidemiological data of pathogenic bacteria and the use of common antibiotics in burn ward of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College was investigated in the past 9 years. Bacteria samples were collected from the wounds, catheters, blood, feces, urine and sputum of inpatients in the unit from January 2010 to December 2018. The antibiotics use density was calculated by defined daily doses (DDDs)/(1 000 patient-days). Results: (1) In the proportion of bacteria detected, Staphylococcus aureus was the first and sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumonia (19.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (11.5%) were the top three Gram-negative bacteria in 2018; the proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly increased (R(2)=0.861, P<0.001). (2) The Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (R(2)=0.447, P=0.049) and ciprofloxacin (R(2)=0.663, P=0.008) increased significantly. The Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to piperacillin (R(2)=0.999, P=0.018), meropenem (R(2)=0.999, P=0.023), ciprofloxacin (R(2)=1.000, P=0.010) increased significantly. There was no significant trend in the Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate. (3) The use density of meropenem increased significantly (R(2)=0.492, P=0.035), and that of ciprofloxacin decreased significantly (R(2)=0.572, P=0.018). (4) Carbapenems use density was positively correlated with resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefoperazone sulbactam (r=0.733, P=0.025), piperacillin tazobactam (r=0.684, P=0.042), cefuroxime (r=0.821, P=0.023), ceftazidime (r=0.741, P=0.022), imipenem (r=0.718, P=0.029), meropenem (r=0.690, P=0.040), amikacin (r=0.750, P=0.020). (5) Ciprofloxacin use density was negatively correlated with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (r=-0.751, P=0.020), Ciprofloxacin (r=-0.873, P=0.002) and with the Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to cefuroxime (r=-0.767, P=0.044), ceftazidime (r=-0.712, P=0.031), imipenem (r=-0.780, P=0.013), meropenem (r=-0.793, P=0.011), ciprofloxacin (r=-0.871, P=0.002), Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (r=-0.793, P=0.011). Conclusion: Carbapenems can induce Klebsiella pneumoniae to be multiple drug resistance; through the relationship between ciprofloxacin use intensity and drug resistance, the strategy of only restricting a certain antimicrobial agent may not restore the bacterial sensitivity.","Dou Y., Zhang Q.",10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20191207-02673,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi
Serratia Infections In Burn Care,"Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen with significant implications for burn care due to its multidrug resistance, virulence, and ability to colonize hospital environments. This retrospective study, conducted at an American Burn Association Verified Burn Centre, reviewed 22 cases of S. marcescens infections from 2015 to 2020. Patients exhibited a mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned of 28% (range: 2-71%), with 68% sustaining burns >20% TBSA and 40.9% presenting with inhalation injuries. The pathogen was most commonly isolated from sputum (36%) and burn wound tissue (50%), with a mean time to positive culture of 8.7 days. Early-onset infections were associated with increased mortality, particularly in patients with major burns, as five out of seven such individuals succumbed to infection. The overall mortality rate was 23%, despite timely antibiotic administration. Targeted topical antimicrobials, such as Dakin's solution, nanocrystalline silver, and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), offer potential benefits but lack robust evidence for optimal use. Stronger clinical data are needed to guide their application and improve outcomes. These findings underscore the need for enhanced surveillance, refined treatment strategies, and research into S. marcescens management in burn care.","Wallace D., Rogers A.D.",10.1093/jbcr/iraf004,Journal Of Burn Care & Research : Official Publication Of The American Burn Association
An Orthogonal And Ph-Tunable Sensor-Selector For Muconic Acid Biosynthesis In Yeast,"Microbes offer enormous potential for production of industrially relevant chemicals and therapeutics, yet the rapid identification of high-producing microbes from large genetic libraries is a major bottleneck in modern cell factory development. Here, we develop and apply a synthetic selection system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that couples the concentration of muconic acid, a plastic precursor, to cell fitness by using the prokaryotic transcriptional regulator BenM driving an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that the sensor-selector does not affect production nor fitness, and find that tuning pH of the cultivation medium limits the rise of nonproducing cheaters. We apply the sensor-selector to selectively enrich for best-producing variants out of a large library of muconic acid production strains, and identify an isolate that produces more than 2 g/L muconic acid in a bioreactor. We expect that this sensor-selector can aid the development of other synthetic selection systems based on allosteric transcription factors.","Snoek T., Romero-Suarez D., Zhang J., Ambri F., Skjoedt M.L., Sudarsan S., Jensen M.K., Keasling J.D.",10.1021/acssynbio.7b00439,Acs Synthetic Biology
Antibiotic Prophylaxis And Resistance In Surgical Site Infection After Immediate Tissue Expander Reconstruction Of The Breast,"BACKGROUND: A recent survey of plastic surgeons showed that the majority prescribed prophylactic antibiotics after hospital discharge for breast reconstruction. There is no clinical evidence that this practice reduces surgical site infection (SSI) after immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction. Furthermore, multiple studies have suggested that current antibiotic choices may not be appropriately covering the causative organisms of SSI.METHODS: An institutional breast reconstruction database from January 2005 to December 2011 was queried to identify patients undergoing immediate tissue expander reconstruction of the breast. The bacteriology of the infection, prophylactic and empiric antibiotic use, and antibiotic sensitivities were analyzed.RESULTS: In 557 cases of immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction performed in 378 patients, SSIs were diagnosed in 50 (9.0%) cases. Two hundred patients were given oral antibiotics at discharge; 178 did not receive antibiotics. Surgical site infection developed in 12.0% of patients given oral antibiotics and in 13.5% of those not receiving antibiotics (P = 0.67). Wound culture data were obtained in 34 SSIs. Twenty-nine had positive cultures. The most common offending organisms were methicillin-sensitive (11) and methicillin-resistant (6) Staphylococcus aureus. Despite increased use of postoperative prophylaxis over the years, SSI incidence remained unchanged. However, trends toward increased resistance of SSI organisms to the preoperative and postoperative prophylaxis agents were observed. When first-generation cephalosporins were used as prophylaxis, SSI organisms showed resistance rates of 20.5% (preoperative cefazolin) and 54.5% (postoperative cephalexin).CONCLUSIONS: Administration of extended prophylactic antibiotics does not reduce overall risk of SSI after expander-based breast reconstruction but may influence antibiotic resistance patterns when infections occur. The organisms most commonly responsible for SSI are often resistant to cefazolin.","Mccullough M.C., Chu C.K., Duggal C.S., Losken A., Carlson G.W.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000000275,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Enhanced Asgr2 By Microplastic Exposure Leads To Resistance To Therapy In Gastric Cancer,"Background: Microplastics (MPs) are a new global environmental threat. Previously, we showed the biodistribution of MPs using [(64)Cu] polystyrene (PS) and PET in mice. Here, we aimed to identify whether PS exposure has malignant effects on the stomach and induces resistance to therapy. Methods: BALB/c nude mice were fed 1.72 × 10(4) particles/mL of MP. We investigated PS accumulation in the stomach using radioisotope-labeled and fluorescent-conjugated PS. Further, we evaluated whether PS exposure induced cancer stemness and multidrug resistance, and whether it affected tumor development, tumor growth, and survival rate in vivo using a 4-week PS-exposed NCI-N87 mouse model. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we analyzed whether PS exposure induced gene expression changes in gastric tissues of mice. Results: PET imaging results showed that a single dose of [(64)Cu]-PS remained for 24 h in the mice stomach. The 4-week daily repetitive dose of fluorescent conjugated PS was deposited in the gastric tissues of mice. When PS was exposed, a 2.9-fold increase in migration rate was observed for NCI-N87 cells. Immunocytochemistry results showed decreased E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin expression, and flow cytometry, qPCR, and western blot analysis indicated a 1.9-fold increase in N-cadherin expression after PS exposure. Further, PS-induced multidrug resistance to bortezomib, paclitaxel, gefitinib, lapatinib, and trastuzumab was observed in the NCI-N87 mouse model due to upregulated CD44 expression. RNA-seq results identified increased asialoglycoprotein receptor 2 (ASGR2) expression after PS exposure, and ASGR2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. Conclusion: We demonstrated that ASGR2 enhanced cancer hallmarks on PS exposure and induced resistance to chemo- and monoclonal antibody-therapy. Our preclinical findings may provide an incentive for further epidemiological studies on the role of MP exposure and its association with gastric cancer.","Kim H., Zaheer J., Choi E.-J., Kim J.S.",10.7150/thno.73226,Theranostics
Sox2 Upregulates Side Population Cells And Enhances Their Chemoresistant Ability By Transactivating Abcc1 Expression Contributing To Intrinsic Resistance To Paclitaxel In Melanoma,"Paclitaxel is the last choice for the treatment of advanced melanoma as a second-line chemotherapeutic agent, but there are still many cases of intrinsic resistance to paclitaxel in melanoma and the reasons that cause paclitaxel resistance remain unclear. Here, we identified that high expression of SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and high ratio of side population (SP) cells reduced the sensitivity to paclitaxel in melanoma cells. The knockout and the induction of SOX2 completely depleted and significantly upregulated the ratios of melanoma SP cells, respectively. These data suggest that SOX2, a pluripotent transcription factor for inducing cancer stem cells in melanoma, is also sufficient and necessary for the induction of melanoma SP cells. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) is one of ABC transporters which causes SP cells to be resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by efficiently pumping drugs out of cells. The knockout and the induction of ABCC1 significantly increased and decreased the sensitivity of melanoma cells to paclitaxel. High expression of ABCC1 was identified in melanoma cell lines with high expression of SOX2 and in their SP cells. SOX2 was identified to induce ABCC1 transcription. Taken together, SOX2 upregulates SP cells and enhances their chemoresistant ability by increasing ABCC1 expression, which contributes to intrinsic resistance to paclitaxel in melanoma. Our findings will lead to new insights into melanoma biology and therapy resistance, and eventually to new therapeutic targets.","Si X., Gao Z., Xu F., Zheng Y.",10.1002/mc.23148,Molecular Carcinogenesis
Clinical Significance Of Alloantibodies In Hand Transplantation: A Multicenter Study,"Background. Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) have a strong negative correlation with long-term survival in solid organ transplantation. Although the clinical significance of DSA and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in upper extremity transplantation (UET) remains to be established, a growing number of single-center reports indicate their presence and potential clinical impact. Methods. We present a multicenter study assessing the occurrence and significance of alloantibodies in UET in reference to immunological parameters and functional outcome. Results. Our study revealed a high prevalence and early development of de novo DSA and non-DSA (43%, the majority detected within the first 3 postoperative y). HLA class II mismatch correlated with antibody development, which in turn significantly correlated with the incidence of acute cellular rejection. Cellular rejections preceded antibody development in almost all cases. A strong correlation between DSA and graft survival or function cannot be statistically established at this early stage but a correlation with a lesser outcome seems to emerge. Conclusions. While the phenotype and true clinical effect of AMR remain to be better defined, the high prevalence of DSA and the correlation with acute rejection highlight the need for optimizing immunosuppression, close monitoring, and the relevance of an HLA class II match in UET recipients.","Berglund E., Andersen Ljungdahl M., Bogdanović D., Berglund D., Wadström J., Kowalski J., Brandacher G., Kamińska D., Kaufman C.L., Talbot S.G., Azari K., Landin L., Höhnke C., Dwyer K.M., Cavadas P.C., Thione A., Clarke B., Kay S., Wilks D., Iyer S., Iglesias M., Özkan Ö., Özkan Ö., Krapf J., Weissenbacher A., Petruzzo P., Schneeberger S.",10.1097/TP.0000000000002650,Transplantation
Antiretroviral Drug Transporters And Metabolic Enzymes In Human Testicular Tissue: Potential Contribution To Hiv-1 Sanctuary Site,"Objectives: The testes are a potential viral sanctuary site for HIV-1 infection. Our study aims to provide insight into the expression and localization of key drug transporters and metabolic enzymes relevant to ART in this tissue compartment. Methods: We characterized gene and protein expression of 12 representative drug transporters and two metabolic enzymes in testicular tissue samples obtained from uninfected (n=8) and virally suppressed HIV-1-infected subjects on ART (n=5) and quantified antiretroviral drug concentrations in plasma and testicular tissues using LC/MS/MS from HIV-1-infected subjects. Results: Our data demonstrate that key ABC drug transporters (permeability glycoprotein, multidrug-resistance protein 1, 2 and 4, and breast cancer resistance protein), solute carrier transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 2B1, organic anion transporter 1, concentrative nucleoside transporter 1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2) and cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) previously shown to interact with many commonly used antiretroviral drugs are expressed at the mRNA and protein level in the testes of both subject groups and localize primarily at the blood-testis barrier, with no significant differences between the two groups. Furthermore, we observed that PIs known to be substrates for ATP-binding cassette membrane transporters, displayed variable testicular tissue penetration, with darunavir concentrations falling below therapeutic values. In contrast, the NRTIs emtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir displayed favourable tissue penetration, reaching concentrations comparable to plasma levels. We also demonstrated that nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ exhibited higher gene expression in the testicular tissue compared with pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor, suggesting a potential regulatory pathway governing drug transporter and metabolic enzyme expression in this tissue compartment. Conclusions: Our data suggest the testes are a complex pharmacological compartment that can restrict the distribution of certain antiretroviral drugs and potentially contribute to HIV-1 persistence.","Huang Y., Hoque M.T., Jenabian M.-A., Vyboh K., Whyte S.-K., Sheehan N.L., Brassard P., Bélanger M., Chomont N., Fletcher C.V., Routy J.-P., Bendayan R.",10.1093/jac/dkw046,Journal Of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy
Longitudinal Immunological Characterization Of The First Presensitized Recipient Of A Face Transplant,"Rejection affects greater than 80% of face transplants, yet no diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) following face transplantation have been established. Given that different treatment strategies are required to address AMR and T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), there is a critical need to delineate the features that can differentiate these two alloimmune responses. Here, we report the longitudinal immunological examination of what we believe to be the first and only highly sensitized recipient of a crossmatch-positive face transplant up to 4 years following transplantation. We conducted gene expression profiling on allograft biopsies collected during suspected AMR and TCMR episodes as well as during 5 nonrejection time points. Our data suggest that there are distinctive molecular features in AMR, characterized by overexpression of endothelial-associated genes, including ICAM1, VCAM1, and SELE. Although our findings are limited to a single patient, these findings highlight the potential importance of developing and implementing molecular markers to differentiate AMR from TCMR to guide clinical management. Furthermore, our case illustrates that molecular assessment of allograft biopsies offers the potential for new insights into the mechanisms underlying rejection. Finally, our medium-term outcomes demonstrate that face transplantation in a highly sensitized patient with a positive preoperative crossmatch is feasible and manageable.","Win T.S., Murakami N., Borges T.J., Chandraker A., Murphy G., Lian C., Barrera V., Ho Sui S., Schoenfeld D., Teague J., Bueno E., Tullius S.G., Pomahac B., Clark R.A., Riella L.V.",10.1172/jci.insight.93894,Jci Insight
3D-Fibroblast Tissues Constructed By A Cell-Coat Technology Enhance Tight-Junction Formation Of Human Colon Epithelial Cells,"Caco-2, human colon carcinoma cell line, has been widely used as a model system for intestinal epithelial permeability because Caco-2 cells express tight-junctions, microvilli, and a number of enzymes and transporters characteristic of enterocytes. However, the functional differentiation and polarization of Caco-2 cells to express sufficient tight-junctions (a barrier) usually takes over 21 days in culture. This may be due to the cell culture environment, for example inflammation induced by plastic petri dishes. Three-dimensional (3D) sufficient cell microenvironments similar to in vivo natural conditions (proteins and cells), will promote rapid differentiation and higher functional expression of tight junctions. Herein we report for the first time an enhancement in tight-junction formation by 3D-cultures of Caco-2 cells on monolayered (1L) and eight layered (8L) normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Trans epithelial electric resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells was enhanced in the 3D-cultures, especially 8L-NHDF tissues, depending on culture times and only 10 days was enough to reach the same TEER value of Caco-2 monolayers after a 21 day incubation. Relative mRNA expression of tight-junction proteins of Caco-2 cells on 3D-cultures showed higher values than those in monolayer structures. Transporter gene expression patterns of Caco-2 cells on 3D-constructs were almost the same as those of Caco-2 monolayers, suggesting that there was no effect of 3D-cultures on transporter protein expression. The expression correlation between carboxylesterase 1 and 2 in 3D-cultures represented similar trends with human small intestines. The results of this study clearly represent a valuable application of 3D-Caco-2 tissues for pharmaceutical applications.","Matsusaki M., Hikimoto D., Nishiguchi A., Kadowaki K., Ohura K., Imai T., Akash M.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.12.118,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
Polystyrene Microplastics Alleviate The Effects Of Sulfamethazine On Soil Microbial Communities At Different Co(2) Concentrations,"Microplastics were reported to adsorb antibiotics and may modify their effects on soil systems. But there has been little research investigating how microplastics may affect the toxicities of antibiotics to microbes under future climate conditions. Here, we used a free-air CO(2) enrichment system to investigate the responses of soil microbes to sulfamethazine (SMZ, 1 mg kg(−1)) in the presence of polystyrene microplastics (PS, 5 mg kg(−1)) at different CO(2) concentrations (ambient at 380 ppm and elevated at 580 ppm). SMZ alone decreased bacterial diversity, negatively affected the bacterial structure and inter-relationships, and enriched the sulfonamide-resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) and class 1 integron (intl1). PS, at both CO(2) conditions, showed little effect on soil bacteria but markedly alleviated SMZ's adverse effects on bacterial diversity, composition and structure, and inhibited sul1 transmission by decreasing the intl1 abundance. Elevated CO(2) had limited modification in SMZ's disadvantages to microbial communities but markedly decreased the sul1 and sul2 abundance. Results indicated that increasing CO(2) concentration or the presence of PS affected the responses of soil microbes to SMZ, providing new insights into the risk prediction of antibiotics under future climate conditions.","Xu M., Du W., Ai F., Xu F., Zhu J., Yin Y., Ji R., Guo H.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125286,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Universal Efavirenz Determination In Transport Study, Rat Placenta Perfusion And Placenta Lysate By Hplc-Uv","Efavirenz is an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. A simple, fast and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed in order to determine efavirenz in three types of samples provided from pharmacokinetic studies. The analysis took 5 min and was performed using a C18 analytical column (Discovery HS C18, 150 × 4.6 mm, particle size of 5 μm) in isocratic mode with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water (65:35, v/v), a flow rate of 1.6 mL min(−1), a sample volume of 10 μL and UV detection at 245 nm. Three different sample matrices (Opti-MEM medium, Krebs perfusion liquid and tissue lysate) and their treatment (dilution, SPE) were considered. The validated method was applied for the analysis of 805 real samples arising from in vitro transcellular transport assays and in vivo organ perfusion experiments in order to evaluate the interaction of efavirenz with ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters. The lack of interaction of efavirenz with ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC2 transporters as well as technical aspects of this analysis, including the adhesion of efavirenz to the plastic materials and the stability of the drug during different tissue lysis approaches are discussed.","Zelena L., Reznicek J., Ceckova M., Sklenarova H.",10.1016/j.jpba.2017.01.012,Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis
Plastic Structures For Diverse Substrates: A Revisit Of Human Abc Transporters,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest groups of primary active transporters that could be found in all kingdoms of life from bacteria to humans. In humans, ABC transporters can selectively transport a wide spectrum of substrates across membranes, thus playing a pivotal role in multiple physiological processes. In addition, due to the ability of exporting clinic therapeutics, some ABC transporters were originally termed multidrug resistance proteins. Increasing investigations of human ABC transporters in recent years have provided abundant information for elucidating their structural features, based on the structures at distinct states in a transport cycle. This review focuses on the recent progress in human ABC structural analyses, substrate binding specificities, and translocation mechanisms. We dedicate to summarize the common features of human ABC transporters in different subfamilies, and to discuss the possibility to apply the fast-developing techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy, and artificial intelligence-assisted structure prediction, for future studies.","Hou W.-T., Xu D., Wang L., Chen Y., Chen Z.-P., Zhou C.-Z., Chen Y.",10.1002/prot.26406,"Proteins: Structure, Function And Bioinformatics"
Double Transverse Myocutaneous Gracilis Free Flaps For Unilateral Breast Reconstruction,"Background: In cases were the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP flap) is not available and unilateral transverse myocutaneous gracilis flap (TMG flap) is not sufficient for breast reconstruction, we perform double TMG flaps as a reconstructive method. In this report, we present our results of the use of double TMG free-flap-transfer for unilateral breast reconstruction. Patients and Methods: Between August 2004 and June 2012 we performed 58 TMG flaps in 29 patients for unilateral breast reconstruction. Patient data were analyzed and operative outcome (operation time, complication rate and aesthetic results) were investigated. Aesthetic outcome was evaluated retrospectively via photo documentation by an independent plastic surgeon. The results were classified in;unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good and very good. Results: The average operating time was 6 hours 55 minutes (295 – 650 minutes). Of 58 TMG flaps, 57 (98.3%) were successful. Thrombosis occurred in seven (12%) cases (1 arterial, 6 venous). Flap salvage was successful in six cases and flap failure occurred in one (1.7%) case. The results of 25 patients were graded as good and very good. Three patients showed satisfying and one patient unsatisfying results. Conclusion: Double TMG flaps in unilateral breast reconstruction could lead to good operative results. This method further expands the range of options with autologous tissue in reconstructive breast surgery. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Inflammatory Cytokines And Biomarkers Of Cartilage Metabolism 8 Years After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Results From Operated And Contralateral Knees,"BACKGROUND: Patients who sustain an acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture are at increased risk to develop posttraumatic arthritis (PTA) in the injured knee whether the ACL is reconstructed or treated nonoperatively. Inflammatory cytokines and cartilage degradation biomarkers are elevated at the time of acute injury and postoperatively. This suggests that one mechanism for PTA may be an inflammatory degradative process initiated on the acute injury and sustained for some length of time independent of whether adequate joint stability is restored.HYPOTHESIS: Inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of cartilage degradation are elevated in the synovial fluid several years after reconstruction of the ACL, indicating an ongoing imbalance between extracellular matrix destruction and repair.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.METHODS: In 11 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction 8 years earlier, knee synovial fluid was aspirated from the operated knee and the contralateral nonoperated knee. The synovial fluid was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG), aggrecan neoepitope fragment (ARGS-aggrecan), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). At follow-up, the patients underwent bilateral weightbearing radiographs and bilateral MRIs of their knees.RESULTS: No significant differences between the operated and the contralateral knee were found for the synovial fluid concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, sGAG, ARGS-aggrecan, or COMP. There were significantly more radiographically visible osteoarthritic changes in the operated knees compared with the contralateral knees. MRIs revealed that all grafts and all contralateral ACLs were intact and, furthermore, that there was significantly more meniscal and cartilage damage in the index knees than the contralateral knees.CONCLUSION: Eight years after ACL reconstruction, there were no significant differences in inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers for cartilage degeneration between the nonoperated and the ACL-reconstructed knee, even though there were more osteoarthritic changes and meniscal and cartilage damage in the operated knee, as seen on weightbearing radiographs and MRI.","Åhlén M., Roshani L., Lidén M., Struglics A., Rostgård-Christensen L., Kartus J.",10.1177/0363546515574059,The American Journal Of Sports Medicine
Optimizing The Bioplastic Chemical Building Block With Wastewater Sludge As The Feedstock Using Carbon-Hydrogen-Oxygen Framework,"The ever-growing production of non-recyclable plastic products causes plastic pollution to be the one of most pressing environmental issues. The transition of petrochemical-based plastic with eco-friendly biodegradable plastic has become the promising solution to overcome the plastic pollution crisis. Recent research addressed the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which is a class of bioplastic through the valorisation of wastewater sludge. However, the high production cost and limited process feasibility studies hinder the commercialisation of the waste-derived PHA synthesis process. Since there is a lack of exploration on material integration by implementing an industrial symbiosis network that could potentially enhance the sustainability of waste-derived PHA production, this paper proposes the optimisation of bioplastic production by creating a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen industrial symbiosis network (CHOSYN) to solve sludge management and resources consumption problem concurrently. The atomic targeting approach is used to benchmark the resources and waste discharge from the model. The findings indicate that the proposed process framework attains sustainability improvement in economic and environmental aspects as compared to the conventional PHA synthesis process. An optimal biorefinery eco-industrial park (EIP) design with the involvement of PHA production is presented and the implication of results obtained is also discussed in this article.","Goh Q.H., Farouk A.A., Chew I.L.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105920,"Resources, Conservation And Recycling"
Flap Reconstruction For Deep Sternal Wound Infections: Factors Influencing Morbidity And Mortality,"Background: Deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) often require flap reconstruction to obliterate dead space and provide healthy soft tissue coverage. A better understanding of risk factors for complications after DSWI flap reconstruction may improve operative management. Methods: A retrospective study (2007-2018) was conducted of all patients with DSWI after cardiothoracic procedure referred to a single reconstructive surgeon for flap reconstruction. Patient and operative factors were reviewed, including procedure types and outcomes. Predictors of morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed. Results: A total of 119 patients requiring flap reconstruction for DSWI met inclusion criteria. Unilateral (49.6%) or bilateral (40.3%) pectoralis muscle flaps were performed most frequently, followed by vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) (4.2%), omental (4.2%), and omental/pectoralis flap combination (1.7%). Superficial surgical site infection (SSI) was the predominant postoperative complication (17.6%). Débridement/revisional procedures were required in 19 patients (16%), and flap failure occurred in 5 (4.2%). Overall 30-day mortality was 15.1%. End-stage renal disease (P = .002), congestive heart failure (P = .049), low albumin (P = .004), cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = .0001), need for open chest (P = .020), and high American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (P = .003) were associated with higher mortality. By multivariate analysis, multidrug resistance was predictive of any postoperative complication (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-23.2; P = .018), VRAM was predictive of SSI (OR, 9.6; 95% CI, 1.4-66.4; P = .022), and end-stage renal disease (OR, 8.57; 95% CI, 1.06-69.1; P = .044) was predictive of higher mortality. Conclusions: Pectoralis muscle flaps are the workhorse for complex sternal wound coverage, but complications after flap reconstruction for DSWIs remain high. In particular, end-stage renal disease, VRAM reconstruction, and multidrug-resistant infection may predict a complicated postoperative course in these patients.","Piwnica-Worms W., Azoury S.C., Kozak G., Nathan S., Stranix J.T., Colen D., Othman S., Vallabhajosyula P., Serletti J., Kovach S.",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.12.014,Annals Of Thoracic Surgery
Pathogens And Their Resistance Behavior In Necrotizing Fasciitis,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare but life-threatening condition in which extensive soft tissue destruction can occur very quickly if left untreated. Therefore, timely broad-spectrum antibiotic administration is of prognostic importance in addition to radical surgical debridement. AIM: This study evaluates the cases of NF in our hospital during the last ten years retrospectively with respect to the pathogens involved and their antimicrobial resistance. This approach aims to provide guidance regarding the most targeted initial antibiotic therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective microbiological study evaluating pathogen detection and resistance patterns including susceptibility testing of 42 patients with NF. RESULTS: Type 1 NF (polymicrobial infection) occurred in 45% of the patients; 31% presented type 2 NF (monomicrobial infection). The most common pathogens detected were E. coli, staphylococci such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, enterococci, and streptococci such as Streptococcus pyogenes. Twelve percent presented an additional fungus infection (type 4). Ten percent showed no cultivation. Two percent (one patient) presented cocci without specification. CONCLUSION: Most pathogens were sensitive to antibiotics recommended by guidelines. This confirms the targeting accuracy of the guidelines. Further studies are necessary to identify risk factors associated with multidrug resistant infections requiring early vancomycin/meropenem administration.","Brébant V., Eschenbacher E., Hitzenbichler F., Pemmerl S., Prantl L., Pawlik M.",10.3233/CH-238119,Clinical Hemorheology And Microcirculation
Porcine Model Of A Complicated Skin And Soft Tissue Infection Caused By Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa poses a significant threat to both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, often resulting in life-threatening infections. With increasing antimicrobial resistance, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Although animal models are crucial for preclinical studies, limited data are available for porcine models, more specifically for P. aeruginosa complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs). This study presents a novel porcine model inducing and sustaining cSSTI for 14 days. Six pigs (120 wounds) were used for the development of infections, and within this group, two pigs (40 wounds) were used to evaluate the progression of the cSSTI infection. The model demonstrated bacterial loads of more than 10(7) CFU/ gram of tissue or higher. The cSSTI fully developed within three days and remained well above these levels until day 14 post-infection. Due to the immunocompetence of this model, all the immunological processes associated with the response to the presence of infection and the wound healing process are preserved.","Lipovy B., Vacek L., Kleknerova D.P., Jeklova E., Liskova L., Holoubek J., Matyskova D., Ruzicka F.",10.17221/25/2024-VETMED,Veterinarni Medicina
Effects Of Triclosan Adsorption On Intestinal Toxicity And Resistance Gene Expression In Xenopus Tropicalis With Different Particle Sizes Of Polystyrene,"Microplastics (MPs) are commonly found with hydrophobic contaminants in the water column and pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. The effects of polystyrene microplastics of different particle sizes on the accumulation of triclosan in the gut of Xenopus tropicalis, its toxic effects, and the transmission of resistance genes were evaluated. The results showed that co-exposure to polystyrene (PS-MPs) adsorbed with triclosan (TCS) caused the accumulation of triclosan in the intestine with the following accumulation capacity: TCS + 5 µm PS group > TCS group > TCS + 20 µm PS group > TCS + 0.1 µm PS group. All experimental groups showed increased intestinal inflammation and antioxidant enzyme activity after 28 days of exposure to PS-MPs and TCS of different particle sizes. The TCS + 20 µm PS group exhibited the highest upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1β). The TCS + 20 µm group showed the highest increase in enzyme activity compared to the control group. PS-MPs and TCS, either alone or together, altered the composition of the intestinal microbial community. In addition, the presence of more antibiotic resistance genes than triclosan resistance genes significantly increased the expression of tetracycline resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes, which may be associated with the development of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. This study refines the aquatic ecotoxicity assessment of TCS adsorbed by MPs and provides informative information for the management and control of microplastics and non-antibiotic bacterial inhibitors.","Dai Z., Wang Z., Pan X., Zheng L., Xu Y., Qiao Q.",10.1016/j.jes.2023.06.036,Journal Of Environmental Sciences (China)

Microplastics From Face Masks: Unraveling Combined Toxicity With Environmental Hazards And Their Impacts On Food Safety,"Microplastics (MPs) refer to tiny plastic particles, typically smaller than 5 mm in size. Due to increased mask usage during COVID-19, improper disposal has led to masks entering the environment and releasing MPs into the surroundings. MPs can absorb environmental hazards and transfer them to humans and animals via the food chain, yet their impacts on food safety and human health are largely neglected. This review summarizes the release process of MPs from face masks, influencing factors, and impacts on food safety. Highlights are given to the prevalence of MPs and their combined toxicities with other environmental hazards. Control strategies are also explored. The release of MPs from face masks is affected by environmental factors like pH, UV light, temperature, ionic strength, and weathering. Due to the chemical active surface and large surface area, MPs can act as vectors for heavy metals, toxins, pesticides, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes, and foodborne pathogens through different mechanisms, such as electrostatic interaction, precipitation, and bioaccumulation. After being adsorbed by MPs, the toxicity of these environmental hazards, such as oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and disruption of metabolic energy levels, can be magnified. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on both the combined toxicities of MPs and environmental hazards, as well as their corresponding control strategies. Future research should prioritize understanding the interaction of MPs with other hazards in the food chain, their combined toxicity, and integrating MPs detection and degradation methods with other hazards.","Pei L., Sheng L., Ye Y., Sun J., Wang J.-S., Sun X.",10.1111/1541-4337.70042,Comprehensive Reviews In Food Science And Food Safety
Are Microplastics In Livestock And Poultry Manure An Emerging Threat To Agricultural Soil Safety?,"Microplastics (MPs) have attracted much attention in recent years, due to the difficulty of degradation and threats to ecological systems and humans. Based on the analysis of 1429 articles on MPs in soil, we found that we know little about the behavior and fate of manure-born MPs from the livestock and poultry production systems to agriculture soils. This review summarizes the analytical methods for sampling, separation, and identification and the occurrence of MPs in livestock and poultry manure, mainly based on 7 surveys related to manure-born MPs. Then, the sources, fate, and environmental risks of MPs in livestock and poultry manure are discussed. MPs, heavy metals, pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes, and persistent organic pollutants are common pollutants in livestock and poultry manure. Worse, manure-born MPs will become smaller, rougher, and more numerous and could easily form more toxic compound pollution after complicated processes of manure treatment, which seriously threatens agricultural soil safety. Finally, an outlook is offered for future research. We hope this article to attract attention to the risks of MPs in livestock and poultry manure and provide a reference for future research.","Long Y., Zhang Y., Zhou Z., Liu R., Qiu Z., Qiu Y., Li J., Wang W., Li X., Yin L., Wen X.",10.1007/s11356-024-31857-6,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
The Effects Of Oral L-Arginine And L-Citrulline Supplementation On Blood Pressure,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a well-known vasodilator produced by the vascular endothelium via the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The inadequate production of NO has been linked to elevated blood pressure (BP) in both human and animal studies, and might be due to substrate inaccessibility. This review aimed to investigate whether oral administration of the amino acids l-arginine (Arg) and l-citrulline (Cit), which are potential substrates for eNOS, could effectively reduce BP by increasing NO production. Both Arg and Cit are effective at increasing plasma Arg. Cit is approximately twice as potent, which is most likely due to a lower first-pass metabolism. The current data suggest that oral Arg supplementation can lower BP by 5.39/2.66 mmHg, which is an effect that is comparable with diet changes and exercise implementation. The antihypertensive properties of Cit are more questionable, but are likely in the range of 4.1/2.08 to 7.54/3.77 mmHg. The exact mechanism by which Cit and Arg exert their effect is not fully understood, as normal plasma Arg concentration greatly exceeds the Michaelis constant (Km) of eNOS. Thus, elevated plasma Arg concentrations would not be expected to increase endogenous NO production significantly, but have nonetheless been observed in other studies. This phenomenon is known as the “l-arginine paradox”.","Khalaf D., Krüger M., Wehland M., Infanger M., Grimm D.",10.3390/nu11071679,Nutrients
Phage Treatment Of An Aortic Graft Infected With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Management of prosthetic vascular graft infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be a significant challenge to clinicians. These infections often do not resolve with antibiotic therapy alone due to antibiotic resistance/tolerance by bacteria, poor ability of antibiotics to permeate/reduce biofilms and/ or other factors. Bacteriophage OMKO1 binding to efflux pump proteins in P. aeruginosa was consistent with an evolutionary trade-off: wildtype bacteria were killed by phage whereas evolution of phage-resistance led to increased antibiotic sensitivity. However, phage clinical-use has not been demonstrated. Here, we present a case report detailing therapeutic application of phage OMKO1 to treat a chronic P. aeruginosa infection of an aortic Dacron graft with associated aorto-cutaneous fistula. Following a single application of phage OMKO1 and ceftazidime, the infection appeared to resolve with no signs of recurrence.","Chan B.K., Turner P.E., Kim S., Mojibian H.R., Elefteriades J.A., Narayan D.",10.1093/emph/eoy005,"Evolution, Medicine And Public Health"
Acquisition And Clearance Of Multidrug Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii On Healthy Young Adults Concurrently Burned In A Dust Explosion In Taiwan: The Implication For Antimicrobial Stewardship,"Background: Information is limited about the effect of restricted carbapenem use on clearance of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). We sought to determine the time effect of antibiotic exposure on multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) acquisition and clearance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study at the intensive care units of a tertiary medical center. Forty-two of a cohort of previously healthy young adults who were concurrently burned by a dust explosion was included. Cases consisted of those from whom MDRAB was isolated during hospitalization. Controls consisted of patients from whom MDRAB was not isolated in the same period. Use of antimicrobial agents was compared based on days of therapy per 1,000 patient-days (DOT/1,000PD). A 2-state Markov multi-state model was used to estimate the risk of acquisition and clearance of MDRAB. Results: MDRAB was discovered in 9/42 (21.4%) individuals. The cases had significantly higher use of carbapenem (652 DOT/1,000PD vs. 385 DOT/1,000PD, P < 0.001) before MDRAB isolation. For the cases, clearance of MDRAB was associated with lower use of carbapenem (469 DOT/1,000PD vs. 708 DOT/1,000PD, P = 0.003) and higher use of non-carbapenem beta-lactam (612 DOT/1,000PD vs. 246 DOT/1,000PD, P <0.001). In multi-state model, each additional DOT of carbapenem increased the hazard of acquiring MDRAB (hazard ratio (HR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.16) and each additional DOT of non-carbapenem beta-lactam increased the protection of clearing MDRAB (HR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.07-1.46). Conclusions: Both acquisition and clearance of MDRAB were related to antibiotic exposure in a homogeneous population. Our findings suggest that early discontinuation of carbapenem could be an effective measure in antibiotic stewardship for the control of MDRAB spreading.","Huang P.-Y., Shie S.-S., Ye J.-J., Lin S.-P., Liu T.-P., Wu T.-S., Wu T.-L., Chuang S.-S., Cheng M.-H., Hsieh Y.-C., Huang C.-T.",10.1186/s12879-017-2682-4,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Paclitaxel-Loaded Star-Shaped Copolymer Nanoparticles For Enhanced Malignant Melanoma Chemotherapy Against Multidrug Resistance,"Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most dangerous type of skin cancer with annually increasing incidence and death rates. However, chemotherapy for MM is restricted by low topical drug concentration and multidrug resistance. In order to surmount the limitation and to enhance the therapeutic effect on MM, a new nanoformulation of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded cholic acid (CA)-functionalized star-shaped poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) nanoparticles (NPs) (shortly PTX-loaded CA-PLGA-TPGS NPs) was fabricated by a modified method of nanoprecipitation. The particle size, zeta potential, morphology, drug release profile, drug encapsulation efficiency, and loading content of PTX-loaded NPs were detected. As shown by confocal laser scanning, NPs loaded with coumarin-6 were internalized by human melanoma cell line A875. The cellular uptake efficiency of CA-PLGA-TPGS NPs was higher than those of PLGA NPs and PLGA-TPGS NPs. The antitumor effects of PTX-loaded NPs were evaluated by the MTT assay in vitro and by a xenograft tumor model in vivo, demonstrating that star-shaped PTX-loaded CA-PLGA-TPGS NPs were significantly superior to commercial PTX formulation Taxol®. Such drug delivery nanocarriers are potentially applicable to the improvement of clinical MM therapy.","Su Y., Hu J., Huang Z., Huang Y., Peng B., Xie N., Liu H.",10.2147/DDDT.S127328,"Drug Design, Development And Therapy"
Cancer Cell Plasticity: Rapid Reversal Of Chemosensitivity And Expression Of Stemness Markers In Lung And Breast Cancer Tumorspheres,"In cancer cells, the reversible nature of the stemness status in terms of chemoresistance has been poorly characterized. In this study, we have simulated one cycle of environmental conditions to study such reversibility by first generating floating tumorspheres (FTs) from lung and breast cancer cells by culturing them in serum-free media without the addition of any external mitogenic stimulation, and subsequently (after 2 weeks) re-incubating them back in serum-containing media to simulate routine culture conditions (RCCs). We found that cancer cells are extremely plastic: cells grown under RCCs become multidrug-resistant when grown as FTs, but upon re-incubation under RCCs quickly re-attach and lose the acquired resistance. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by concomitant changes in the expression of key proteins associated with multiple pathways important for chemoresistance, survival, and stemness maintenance. Therefore, our strategy provides an excellent experimental model to study environmental factors that modulate the plasticity of cancer cells. J. Cell.

High-Resolution Nmr Studies Of Antibiotics In Cellular Membranes,"The alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance requires antibiotics with unexploited mechanisms. Ideal templates could be antibiotics that target the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II, known as the bacterial Achilles heel, at an irreplaceable pyrophosphate group. Such antibiotics would kill multidrug-resistant pathogens at nanomolecular concentrations without causing antimicrobial resistance. However, due to the challenge of studying small membrane-embedded drug–receptor complexes in native conditions, the structural correlates of the pharmaceutically relevant binding modes are unknown. Here, using advanced highly sensitive solid-state NMR setups, we present a high-resolution approach to study lipid II-binding antibiotics directly in cell membranes. On the example of nisin, the preeminent lantibiotic, we show that the native antibiotic-binding mode strongly differs from previously published structures, and we demonstrate that functional hotspots correspond to plastic drug domains that are critical for the cellular adaptability of nisin. Thereby, our approach provides a foundation for an improved understanding of powerful antibiotics.","Medeiros-Silva J., Jekhmane S., Paioni A.L., Gawarecka K., Baldus M., Swiezewska E., Breukink E., Weingarth M.",10.1038/s41467-018-06314-x,Nature Communications
The Effect Of Chemical Hemodynamic Regulation On The Survival Of Arterialized Venous Flaps,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) on the microcirculation of arterialized venous flaps (AVFs) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect of hemodynamic regulation using nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and its agonist as a chemical intervention on the survival of AVF. A 10 × 8 cm arterialized venous flap was designed symmetrically on the rabbit abdomen. Thirty-six rabbits were used and randomly divided into three groups: control group, L-arg group and L-NAME group, respectively. The L-arg group and the L-NAME group received intraperitoneal injections of L-arginine (a NOS agonist, 1 g/kg/d) and L-NAME (nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, a NOS inhibitor, 50 mg/kg/d) respectively, whereas the control group received intraperitoneal injections of the same amount of saline. Flap viability, water content, status of vascular perfusion and gene expression of eNOS and HIF-1α in each group were observed and analyzed. The average value of water content (venous congestion) in the L-arg group was the highest in comparison with the control group and the L-NAME group with a statistically significant difference (all p < .001). Similar results regarding blood perfusion state, gene expression of eNOS and HIF-1α and flap survival status were found among the three groups. The early application of L- NAME as a chemical hemodynamic intervention could stop the cascade of flap swelling, congestion and necrosis due to overexpression of NO and be beneficial to the AVF survival. Our findings may develop a new strategy as a solution for the inconsistent survival of AVFs.","Zhao B., Poonit K., Zhou X., Yao C., Sun C., Yan H.",10.1080/2000656X.2018.1550418,Journal Of Plastic Surgery And Hand Surgery
"Silver Nanoparticles In The Environment: Sources, Detection And Ecotoxicology","The environmental impact of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) has become a topic of interest recently, this is due to the fact that AgNPs have been included in numerous consumer products including textiles, medical products, domestic appliances, food containers, cosmetics, paints and nano-functionalised plastics. The production, use and disposal of these AgNP containing products are potential routes for environmental exposure. These concerns have led to a number of studies investigating the release of particles from nano-functionalised products, the detection of the particles in the aquatic environment and the potential environmental toxicology of these AgNPs to aquatic organisms. The overall aim of this review is to examine methods for the capture and detection of AgNPs, potential toxicity and transmission routes in the aquatic environment.","Mcgillicuddy E., Murray I., Kavanagh S., Morrison L., Fogarty A., Cormican M., Dockery P., Prendergast M., Rowan N., Morris D.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.041,Science Of The Total Environment
"The Influence Of Topically Administered Heparin On Peripheral Microcirculation Of The Skin: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Preliminary Study On 50 Healthy Subjects","Background Venous thrombosis is the most common cause of flap failure in the first days after surgery. Although heparin is one of the most important antithrombotic substances and is implemented in the therapy of various diseases, there are only a few studies addressing its topical administration in the field of flap surgery. Especially, very little is known about the effects of topical heparin and its impact on microcirculation. In this study we evaluated to what extent topically administered heparin influences skin microcirculation (capillary venous oxygen saturation SO2, blood filling of microvessels, blood flow, and velocity) in healthy subjects. Methods Skin perfusion parameters on the forearm were measured with the O2C device in a double-blinded, controlled, and randomized study with 50 healthy subjects after administration of heparin ointment in three different concentrations and a control ointment (dexpanthenol). Results Topically administrated heparin slightly increased SO2 (max. 187 ± 285 SD or standard deviation % vs. 145 ± 129 SD %), flow (max. 264 ± 427 SD % vs. 151.74 ± 111 SD %), and velocity (max. 153 ± 149 SD % vs. 122 ± 56 SD %) after an incubation time of 60 minutes in comparison to control. No statistically significant difference could be detected regarding heparin concentration. Conclusion As a first important step in possible future implementing of heparin as a topical administration in flap surgery, our data-although not statistically significant-indicate that heparin can improve microcirculation (SO2, flow) in healthy subjects. Nevertheless, further research in subjects with impaired microcirculation is necessary.","Denzinger M., Held M., Amr A., Krauβ S., Bender D., Daigeler A., Wenger A.",10.1055/s-0041-1726028,Journal Of Reconstructive Microsurgery
The Impact Of Age On Perioperative Complications After Extremity Reconstruction With The Free Gracilis Flap: A Retrospective Cohort Study Involving 153 Patients,"Background The need for plastic and reconstructive surgery on elderly patients has been on the rise due to an increase in life expectancy in the past decades. Therefore, a study was conducted on young and elderly patients following microsurgical extremity reconstructions with free gracilis muscle flaps with the primary aim to investigate the influence of age and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score on the general outcome, as well as surgical and medical complications. Methods A retrospective analysis of 153 patients receiving free gracilis muscle flaps for extremity reconstructions between November 2009 and January 2018 was performed at two partner institutions specialized in microsurgical reconstructions. A logistic regression analysis was performed to correlate age and the ASA score with postoperative complication probability. Patients younger than 70 years were directly compared with elderly patients with respect to age, gender, ASA score, preexisting comorbidities, localization, and postoperative medical and surgical complications. Results Age turned out to be not significantly associated with major flap complications (p = 0.925) but with higher ASA scores (p = 0.016). However, an age-related significant increase in minor flap complications could be observed in the elderly (p = 0.008). A significant correlation between minor medical complications and age could be observed (p = 0.001) in contrast to ASA score (p = 0.912). Conclusion An increased minor flap, as well as minor and major medical complications, must be expected in extremity reconstructions with free gracilis flaps in elderly patients. Higher ASA scores correlate with a higher incidence of major flap complications. Septuagenarians are more prone to develop perioperative major medical complications than patients younger than 70 years. Age and general medical condition, coupled with the performance of each patient, should be thoroughly assessed individually to facilitate a tailored reconstructive approach using risk assessment tools and established scoring systems.","Weitgasser L., Amr A., Hladik M., Wechselberger G., Daigeler A., Schoeller T., Medved F.",10.1055/s-0038-1677455,Journal Of Reconstructive Microsurgery
Incorporating Environmental Impacts Into The Economic Evaluation Of Health Care Systems: Perspectives From Ecological Economics,"Health care is responsible for a range of negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, plastics waste, and pharmaceutical pollution of ecosystems through excretion and inappropriate disposal. Evidence on the scale of these impacts has been growing in high-income countries. To date, there has been only limited discussion of how environmental impacts might be incorporated into economic evaluations of health care programs, including health technology assessment. This paper considers why and how this aim might be achieved, using perspectives from both mainstream and ecological economics. There are strong arguments for using economic evaluation to internalise the negative environmental externalities currently being generated by health care, as well as precautionary arguments for health systems to better understand their exposure to their environmental impacts. The paper tests the feasibility of incorporating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions within costing for economic evaluation, and concludes that the use of shadow prices to achieve this aim is feasible. It suggests that this cost-based approach is preferable to more convoluted attempts to incorporate environmental impacts in the outcome component of health economic evaluations. The interaction between overuse, antimicrobial resistance and environmental harms of health care is identified as an area that would benefit from investigation using innovative economic methods.",Hensher M.,10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104623,"Resources, Conservation And Recycling"
Hypoxia-Sensitive Micellar Nanoparticles For Co-Delivery Of Sirna And Chemotherapeutics To Overcome Multi-Drug Resistance In Tumor Cells,"Recently, it has been discovered that the PEG layer on nanoparticle surface can create steric hindrance, preventing efficient cellular uptake of PEGylated nanoparticles. Thus, it would be ideal to have a nanoparticle system that sheds the PEG layer upon reaching the tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia, which is a hallmark of cancerous tumors, can be used as a trigger to shed the PEG layer from the nanoparticle surface. In this study, a hypoxia-sensitive PEG-azobenzene-PEI-DOPE (PAPD) construct, with an azobenzene group as a hypoxia-sensitive moiety, was prepared. The feasibility of co-delivering Doxorubicin (Dox) and anti-P-gp siRNA (siPgp) using the PAPD nanoparticles was evaluated in monolayers of the Adriamycin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780 ADR, and in 3D spheroids of the multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line, MCF7 ADR. Under hypoxic conditions, the PAPD nanoparticles showed up to a 60% increase in cellular uptake by monolayers and a significantly greater tumor penetration in a spheroid model. siPgp, when delivered using PAPD nanoparticles, showed up to a 60% P-gp downregulation under hypoxic conditions. The combination of siPgp and Dox delivered using PAPD nanoparticles led to an 80% cytotoxicity in cell monolayers and 20% cytotoxicity in spheroids under hypoxic conditions. In this research, a novel hypoxia-sensitive nanoparticle system was developed that demonstrated improved delivery of an encapsulated cargo and augmented cytotoxicity on multidrug-resistant cancer cells under hypoxic conditions.","Joshi U., Filipczak N., Khan M.M., Attia S.A., Torchilin V.",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119915,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics
Polyethylene Glycol Coatings On Plastic Substrates For Chemically Defined Stem Cell Culture,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a widely available and clinically relevant cell type with a host of applications in regenerative medicine. Current clinical expansion methods can lead to selective changes in hMSC phenotype potentially resulting from relatively undefined cell culture surfaces. Chemically defined synthetic surfaces can aid in understanding the influence of cell-material interactions on stem cell behavior. Here, a thin copolymer coating for hMSC culture on plastic substrates is developed. The random copolymer is synthesized by living free radical polymerization and characterized in solution before application to the substrate, ensuring a homogeneous coating and limiting the sample-to-sample variations. The ability to coat multiple substrate types and cover large surface areas is reported. Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides are incorporated into the coating under aqueous conditions via their lysine or cysteine side chains, resulting in amide and thioester linkages, respectively. Stability studies show amide linkages to be stable and thioester linkages to be labile under standard serum-containing culture conditions. In addition, chemically defined passaging of hMSCs using only ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on polystyrene dishes is shown. After passage, the hMSCs can be seeded back onto the same plate, indicating potential reusability of the coating. A thermally crosslinkable polymer coating, which is compatible with plastic substrates, provides a chemically defined substrate for human stem cell culture. The coating is applied to large areas using low concentrations of Arg-Gly-Asp peptides. Chemically defined passage is demonstrated, as is the ability to tailor the peptide stability through either thioester or amide peptide-polymer bonds.","Schmitt S.K., Xie A.W., Ghassemi R.M., Trebatoski D.J., Murphy W.L., Gopalan P.",10.1002/adhm.201500191,Advanced Healthcare Materials
Collateral Effects Of Microplastic Pollution On Aquatic Microorganisms: An Ecological Perspective,"Microplastics (MP) provide a unique and extensive surface for microbial colonization in aquatic ecosystems. The formation of microorganism-microplastic complexes, such as biofilms, maximizes the degradation of organic matter and horizontal gene transfer. In this context, MP affect the structure and function of microbial communities, which in turn render the physical and chemical fate of MP. This new paradigm generates challenges for microbiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology. Dispersal of MP is concomitant with that of their associated microorganisms and their mobile genetic elements, including antibiotic resistance genes, islands of pathogenicity, and diverse metabolic pathways. Functional changes in aquatic microbiomes can alter carbon metabolism and food webs, with unknown consequences on higher organisms or human microbiomes and hence health. Here, we examine a variety of effects of MP pollution from the microbial ecology perspective, whose repercussions on aquatic ecosystems begin to be unraveled.","Arias-Andres M., Rojas-Jimenez K., Grossart H.-P.",10.1016/j.trac.2018.11.041,Trac - Trends In Analytical Chemistry
Subeschar Culture Using A Punch Instrument In Unstageable Wounds,"Background A patient’s overall condition sometimes does not allow for the complete removal of a dead eschar or injured slough in cases involving a pressure-injury skin lesion. This frequently occurs in clinical practice, particularly in bedridden and older patients receiving home care or intensive care. Even after debridement, it is also difficult to manage open exu-dative wounds in these patients. Nevertheless, when a mature or immature eschar is treated without proper debridement, liquefaction necrosis underneath the eschar or slough tends to reveal a large, open wound with infectious exudates. We hypothesized that if the presence of any bacteria under the eschar can be evaluated and the progression of the presumed infection of the subeschar can be halted or delayed without creating an open wound, the final wound can be small, shallow, and uninfected. Methods Using a punch instrument, we performed 34 viable subeschar tissue cultures with a secure junction between the eschar and the normal skin. Results The bacterial study had 29 positive results. Based on these results and the patient’s status, appropriate antibiotics could be selected and administered. The use of suitable antibiotics led to relatively shallow and small exposed wounds. Conclusions This procedure could be used to detect potentially pathogenic bacteria hidden under black or yellow eschars. Since subeschar infections are often accompanied by multi-drug-resistant bacteria, the early detection of hidden infections and the use of appropriate antibiotics are expected to be helpful to patients.","Jung H.B., Lee Y.J.",10.5999/aps.2019.01641,Archives Of Plastic Surgery
Biodegradation And Antimicrobial Capability-Induced Heavy Metal Resistance Of The Marine-Derived Actinomycetes Nocardia Harenae Jjb5 And Amycolatopsis Marina Jjb11,"Currently, heavy metal-resistant (HMR) marine actinomycetes have attracted much attention worldwide due to their unique capabilities. In this study, 27 marine-derived actinomycetes were isolated from coastal beaches in the Arabian Gulf of Al-Jubail in Saudi Arabia and screened for resistance to 100 mg/L of the heavy metals Cd2+, Cr6+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Pb2+, and Ni2+ using different assay techniques. Six isolates were selected as HMRs, of which two isolates, JJB5 and JJB11, exhibited the highest maximum tolerance concentrations (200- > 300 mg/L). Both isolates were the highest among six-HMR screened for their biodegradation potential of plastics low-density polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride, recording the highest weight loss (15 ± 1.22 - 65 ± 1.2%) in their thin films. They also showed the highest biodegradability of the pesticides acetamiprid, chlordane, hexachlorocyclohexane, indoxacarb and lindane, indicating promising removal capacities (95.70-100%) for acetamiprid and indoxacarb using HPLC analysis. Additionally, the cell-free filtrate (CFF) of both isolates displayed the highest antimicrobial activity among the six-HMR screened against a variety of microbial test strains, recording the highest inhibition zone diameters (13.76 ± 0.66 - 26.0 ± 1.13 mm). GC‒MS analyses of the ethyl acetate extract of their CFFs revealed the presence of diverse chemical compounds with a multitude of remarkable biological activities. Based on their spore morphology and wall-chemotype, they were assigned to the nocardioform-actinomycetes. Furthermore, their phenotypic characteristics, together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (OR121525-OR121526), revealed them as Nocardia harenae JJB5 and Amycolatopsis marina JJB11.

April/Blys Deficient Rats Prevent Donor Specific Antibody (Dsa) Production And Cell Proliferation In Rodent Kidney Transplant Model,"APRIL (A proliferation inducing ligand) and BLyS (B Lymphocyte Stimulator) are two critical survival factors for B lymphocytes and plasma cells, the main source of alloantibody. We sought to characterize the specific effects of these cytokines in a kidney transplant model of antibody mediated rejection (AMR). We engineered APRIL(-/-) and BLyS(-/-) Lewis rats using CRISPR/Cas9. APRIL(-/-) and BLyS(-/-) rats were sensitized with Brown Norway (BN) blood (complete MHC mismatch). Twenty-one days following sensitization, animals were harvested and collected tissues were analyzed using flow cytometry, ELISPOT, and immunohistochemistry. Flow cross match and a 3 day mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was performed to assess donor specific antibody (DSA) production and T-cell proliferation, respectively. Sensitized dual knock out Lewis rats (APRIL(-/-)/BLyS(-/-)) underwent kidney transplantation and were sacrificed on day 7 post-transplant. Sensitized BLyS(-/-) had significant decreases in DSA and cell proliferation compared to WT and APRIL(-/-) (p<0.02). Additionally, BLyS(-/-) rats had a significant reduction in IgG secreting cells in splenic marginal zone B lymphocytes, and in cell proliferation when challenged with alloantigen compared to WT and APRIL(-/-). Transplanted APRIL(-/-)/BLyS(-/-) rodents had significantly less DSA and antibody secreting cells compared to WT (p<0.05); however, this did not translate into a significant difference in AMR seen between groups. In summary, our studies suggest that APRIL and BLyS play a greater role in DSA generation rather than AMR, highlighting the role of cellular pathways that regulate AMR.","Bath N.M., Verhoven B.M., Wilson N.A., Zeng W., Zhong W., Coons L., Djamali A., Redfield R.R.",10.1371/journal.pone.0275564,Plos One
"Surveillance For And Susceptibility Of Acinetobacter Baumannii In A Large Hospital And Burn Center In Shanghai, China, 2007-2013","Knowledge of epidemiology and microbial resistance helps clinicians carry out appropriate infection control strategies. A retrospective study in a comprehensive hospital, including a burn center, and using CHINET (the surveillance system for bacterial epidemiology and resistance in China) from 2007-2013 revealed that gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii in the burn center demonstrated higher resistance rates to ceftazidime, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and cefoperazone-sulbactam compared with the hospital and CHINET data. The high rate of antibiotic use in the burn center may have contributed to these results.","Guo H., Qin J., Xiang J.",10.1016/j.ajic.2016.06.014,American Journal Of Infection Control
Invasive Non-Candida Fungal Infections In Acute Burns-A 13-Year Review Of A Single Institution And Review Of The Literature,"The past decade has demonstrated increased burn wound infections with atypical invasive fungal organisms. The range of previously regiospecific organisms has expanded, and plant pathogens are increasingly represented. Our institution sought to examine changes in severe fungal non-Candida infections in our patients, via retrospective review of patients admitted to our burn center from 2008 to 2021. We identified 37 patients with atypical invasive fungal infections. Non-Candida genera included Aspergillus (23), Fusarium (8), Mucor (6), and 13 cases of 11 different species, including the second-ever human case of Petriella setifera. Three fungi were resistant to at least one antifungal. Concomitant infections included Candida (19), Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (14), Enterococcus and Enterobacter (13), Pseudomonas (9), and 14 additional genera. Complete data was available for 18 patients, who had a median of 3.0 (IQR 8.5, range 0-15) additional bacteria required a median of 1 (IQR 7, range 0-14) systemic antibacterials and 2 (IQR 2.5, range 0-4) systemic antifungals. One case of total-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa required bacteriophage treatment. One case of Treponema pallidum was found in infected burn wound tissue. Every patient required Infectious Disease consultation. Eight patients became bacteremic and one developed Candida fermentatifungemia. There were five patient deaths (13.8%), all due to overwhelming polymicrobial infection. Burn patients with atypical invasive fungal infections can have severe concomitant polymicrobial infections and multidrug resistance with fatal results. Early Infectious Disease consultation and aggressive treatment is critical. Further characterization of these patients may provide better understanding of risk factors and ideal treatmentpatterns.","Akhavan A.A., Shamoun F., Lagziel T., Rostami S., Cox C.A., Cooney C.M., Sood G., Hultman C.S., Caffrey J.A.",10.1093/jbcr/irad105,Journal Of Burn Care And Research
A Genetic Toolbox To Empower Paracoccus Pantotrophus Dsm 2944 As A Metabolically Versatile Synbio Chassis,"Background: To contribute to the discovery of new microbial strains with metabolic and physiological robustness and develop them into successful chasses, Paracoccus pantotrophus DSM 2944, a Gram-negative bacterium from the phylum Alphaproteobacteria and the family Rhodobacteraceae, was chosen. The strain possesses an innate ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. It utilizes diverse substrates, including cheap and renewable feedstocks, such as C1 and C2 compounds. Also, it can consume short-chain alkanes, predominately found in hydrocarbon-rich environments, making it a potential bioremediation agent. The demonstrated metabolic versatility, coupled with the synthesis of the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate, positions this microbial strain as a noteworthy candidate for advancing the principles of a circular bioeconomy. Results: The study aims to follow the chassis roadmap, as depicted by Calero and Nikel, and de Lorenzo, to transform wild-type P. pantotrophus DSM 2944 into a proficient SynBio (Synthetic Biology) chassis. The initial findings highlight the antibiotic resistance profile of this prospective SynBio chassis. Subsequently, the best origin of replication (ori) was identified as RK2. In contrast, the non-replicative ori R6K was selected for the development of a suicide plasmid necessary for genome integration or gene deletion. Moreover, when assessing the most effective method for gene transfer, it was observed that conjugation had superior efficiency compared to electroporation, while transformation by heat shock was ineffective. Robust host fitness was demonstrated by stable plasmid maintenance, while standardized gene expression using an array of synthetic promoters could be shown. pEMG-based scarless gene deletion was successfully adapted, allowing gene deletion and integration. The successful integration of a gene cassette for terephthalic acid degradation is showcased. The resulting strain can grow on both monomers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with an increased growth rate achieved through adaptive laboratory evolution. Conclusion: The chassis roadmap for the development of P. pantotrophus DSM 2944 into a proficient SynBio chassis was implemented. The presented genetic toolkit allows genome editing and therewith the possibility to exploit Paracoccus for a myriad of applications.","Pal U., Bachmann D., Pelzer C., Christiansen J., Blank L.M., Tiso T.",10.1186/s12934-024-02325-0,Microbial Cell Factories
Diclofenac Resensitizes Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus To Β-Lactams And Prevents Implant Infections,"Implant infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause major complications during the perioperative period. Diclofenac, one of the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is often used to relieve pain and inflammation. In this study, it is found that high-dose diclofenac can inhibit the growth of MRSA, and does not easily induce drug-resistant mutations after continuous passage. However, low-doses diclofenac can resensitize bacteria to β-lactams, which help to circumvent drug resistance and improve the antibacterial efficacy of conventional antibiotics. Further, low-dose diclofenac in combination with β-lactams inhibit MRSA associated biofilm formation in implants. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicate that diclofenac can reduce the expression of genes and proteins associated with β-lactam resistance: mecA, mecR, and blaZ; peptidoglycan biosynthesis: murA, murC, femA, and femB; and biofilm formation: altE and fnbP. Murine implant infection models indicate that diclofenac combined with β-lactams, can substantially alleviate MRSA infections in vivo. In addition, it is investigated that low dose diclofenac can inhibit MRSA antibiotic resistance via the mecA/blaZ pathway and related biofilms in implants. The synergistic effect of diclofenac and β-lactams might have promising applications for preventing perioperative infection, considering its multitarget effects against MRSA.","Zhang S., Qu X., Tang H., Wang Y., Yang H., Yuan W., Yue B.",10.1002/advs.202100681,"Advanced Science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
Candida Auris Susceptibility On Surfaces Coated With The Antifungal Drug Caspofungin,"Candida auris is known to survive for weeks on solid material surfaces. Its longevity contributes to medical device contamination and spread through healthcare facilities. We fabricated antifungal surface coatings by coating plastic and glass surfaces with a thin polymer layer to which the antifungal drug caspofungin was covalently conjugated. Caspofungin-susceptible and -resistant C. auris strains were inhibited on these surfaces by 98.7 and 81.1%, respectively. Cell viability studies showed that this inhibition was fungicidal. Our findings indicate that C. auris strains can be killed on contact when exposed to caspofungin that is reformulated as a covalently-bound surface layer. Lay summary: Candida auris is pathogenic, multidrug resistant yeast with the ability to survive on surfaces and remain transmissible for long periods of time in healthcare settings. In this study, we have prepared an antifungal surface coating and demonstrated its ability to kill adhering C. auris cells on contact.","Lamont-Friedrich S.J., Kidd S.E., Giles C., Griesser H.J., Coad B.R.",10.1093/mmy/myab075,Medical Mycology
Complete Genome Sequence Of Photobacterium Ganghwense C2.2: A New Polyhydroxyalkanoate Production Candidate,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable bioplastics that can be manufactured sustainably and represent a promising green alternative to petrochemical-based plastics. Here, we describe the complete genome of a new marine PHA-producing bacterium—Photobacterium ganghwense (strain C2.2), which we have isolated from the Black Sea seashore. This new isolate is psychrotolerant and accumulates PHA when glycerol is provided as the main carbon source. Transmission electron microscopy, specific staining with Nile Red visualized via epifluorescence microscopy and gas chromatography analysis confirmed the accumulation of PHA. This is the only PHA-producing Photobacterium for which we now have a complete genome sequence, allowing us to investigate the pathways for PHA production and other secondary metabolite synthesis pathways. The de novo assembly genome, obtained using open-source tools, comprises two chromosomes (3.5, 2 Mbp) and a megaplasmid (202 kbp). We identify the entire PHA synthesis gene cluster that encodes a class I PHA synthase, a phasin, a 3-ketothiolase, and an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. No conventional PHA depolymerase was identified in strain C2.2, but a putative lipase with extracellular amorphous PHA depolymerase activity was annotated, suggesting that C2.2 is unable to degrade intracellular PHA. A complete pathway for the conversion of glycerol to acetyl-CoA was annotated, in accordance with its ability to convert glycerol to PHA. Several secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and a low number of genes involved in antibiotic resistance and virulence were also identified, indicating the strain's suitability for biotechnological applications.","Lascu I., Mereuță I., Chiciudean I., Hansen H., Avramescu S.M., Tănase A.-M., Stoica I.",10.1002/mbo3.1182,Microbiologyopen
Infections In Burn Patients: A Retrospective View Over Seven Years,"Backgroundand objectives: Burn patients represent a challenging cohort because the injuries entail a vulnerability to colonisation by microorganisms. The ensuing infections can lead to serious complications and, in many cases, to the death of the burn patient. Surgical intervention and wound dressings, as well as antibiotic treatment, are crucial for optimising the treatment of the patient. Materialand Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we analysed the treatment course, antibiotic therapy, and general complications of 252 burn patients with second- or third-degree burns over a time span of 7 years. Results: Patients who developed infections tended to have, on average, a higher total body surface area (TBSA), higher abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) scores, and longer hospital stays. Patients who were admitted to the burn unit after 2006 had significantly shorter stays in the burn unit. TBSA and ABSI scores were lower in the patient cohort admitted after 2006. Patients exhibiting a TBSA greater than 30% had significantly longer hospital stays and antibiotic treatment periods. TBSA and ABSI scores were significantly higher in patients who died. The results of binary logistic regression indicate that a higher ABSI score increases the odds ratio of developing an infection. Bacteria number had no significant effect on the odds of patient death but positively influenced the odds ratio of developing an infection. TBSA was negatively associated with the risk of developing an infection and was an insignificant predictor of mortality. Conclusions: To gauge the optimal treatment for a burn patient, it is crucial for practitioners to correctly select, dose, and time antibiotics for the patient. Monitoring bacterial colonisation is vital to nip rising infection in the bud and ensure the correct antibiotic selection. This will help prevent the development of multi-resistant bacteria.","Tsolakidis S., Freytag D.L., Dovern E., Alharbi Z., Kim B.-S., Houschyar K.S., Reumuth G., Schäfer B., Rennekampff H.-O., Pallua N., Grieb G.",10.3390/medicina58081066,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
Mitochondrial Transfer From Adipose Stem Cells To Breast Cancer Cells Drives Multi-Drug Resistance,"Background: Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease, showing heterogeneity in the genetic background, molecular subtype, and treatment algorithm. Historically, treatment strategies have been directed towards cancer cells, but these are not the unique components of the tumor bulk, where a key role is played by the tumor microenvironment (TME), whose better understanding could be crucial to obtain better outcomes. Methods: We evaluated mitochondrial transfer (MT) by co-culturing Adipose stem cells with different Breast cancer cells (BCCs), through MitoTracker assay, Mitoception, confocal and immunofluorescence analyses. MT inhibitors were used to confirm the MT by Tunneling Nano Tubes (TNTs). MT effect on multi-drug resistance (MDR) was assessed using Doxorubicin assay and ABC transporter evaluation. In addition, ATP production was measured by Oxygen Consumption rates (OCR) and Immunoblot analysis. Results: We found that MT occurs via Tunneling Nano Tubes (TNTs) and can be blocked by actin polymerization inhibitors. Furthermore, in hybrid co-cultures between ASCs and patient-derived organoids we found a massive MT. Breast Cancer cells (BCCs) with ASCs derived mitochondria (ADM) showed a reduced HIF-1α expression in hypoxic conditions, with an increased ATP production driving ABC transporters-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR), linked to oxidative phosphorylation metabolism rewiring. Conclusions: We provide a proof-of-concept of the occurrence of Mitochondrial Transfer (MT) from Adipose Stem Cells (ASCs) to BC models. Blocking MT from ASCs to BCCs could be a new effective therapeutic strategy for BC treatment.","Del Vecchio V., Rehman A., Panda S.K., Torsiello M., Marigliano M., Nicoletti M.M., Ferraro G.A., De Falco V., Lappano R., Lieto E., Pagliuca F., Caputo C., La Noce M., Papaccio G., Tirino V., Robinson N., Desiderio V., Papaccio F.",10.1186/s13046-024-03087-8,Journal Of Experimental And Clinical Cancer Research
Nanoplastic Ingestion Enhances Toxicity Of Persistent Organic Pollutants (Pops) In The Monogonont Rotifer Brachionus Koreanus Via Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Disruption,"Among the various materials found inside microplastic pollution, nanosized microplastics are of particular concern due to difficulties in quantification and detection; moreover, they are predicted to be abundant in aquatic environments with stronger toxicity than microsized microplastics. Here, we demonstrated a stronger accumulation of nanosized microbeads in the marine rotifer Brachionus koreanus compared to microsized ones, which was associated with oxidative stress-induced damages on lipid membranes. In addition, multixenobiotic resistance conferred by P-glycoproteins and multidrug resistance proteins, as a first line of membrane defense, was inhibited by nanoplastic pre-exposure, leading to enhanced toxicity of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether and triclosan in B. koreanus. Our study provides a molecular mechanistic insight into the toxicity of nanosized microplastics toward aquatic invertebrates and further implies the significance of synergetic effects of microplastics with other environmental persistent organic pollutants.","Jeong C.-B., Kang H.-M., Lee Y.H., Kim M.-S., Lee J.-S., Seo J.S., Wang M., Lee J.-S.",10.1021/acs.est.8b03211,Environmental Science And Technology
Implementation Of Surgical Site Infection Surveillance In Low- And Middle-Income Countries A Position Statement For The International Society For Infectious Diseases: A Position Statement For The International Society For Infectious Diseases,"Surgical site infection (SSI) rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) range from 8 to 30% of procedures, making them the most frequent healthcare-acquired infection (HAI) with substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic impacts. Presented here is an approach to surgical site infection prevention based on surveillance and focused on five critical areas identified by international experts. These five areas include 1. Collecting valid, high-quality data; 2. Linking HAIs to economic incapacity, underscoring the need to prioritize infection prevention activities; 3. Implementing SSI surveillance within infection prevention and control (IPC) programs to enact structural changes, develop procedural skills, and alter healthcare worker behaviors; 4. Prioritizing IPC training for healthcare workers in LMICs to conduct broad-based surveillance and to develop and implement locally applicable IPC programs; and 5. Developing a highly accurate and objective international system for defining SSIs, which can be translated globally in a straightforward manner. Finally, we present a clear, unambiguous framework for successful SSI guideline implementation that supports developing sustainable IPC programs in LMICs. This entails 1. Identifying index operations for targeted surveillance; 2. Identifying IPC “champions” and empowering healthcare workers; 3. Using multimodal improvement measures; 4. Positioning hand hygiene programs as the basis for IPC initiatives; 5. Use of telecommunication devices for surveillance and healthcare outcome follow-ups.

Alar Base Augmentation Using Vomerine Bone Graft In Patients With Cleft Lip Nasal Deformity,"BACKGROUND: Although many trials have been made to augment the unilateral alar base depression, the ultimate aesthetic satisfaction has proven difficult to achieve. In our study, we present a novel submucosal dissection technique to harvest the vomer bone and use it as an onlay graft to correct the alar base depression. METHODS: We collected a prospective cohort study of 11 patients with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity. Using CorelDRAW X7 software, we obtained perioperative clinical photographs to analyze the nostril and lateral lip morphometric measurements on the cleft side. Computed tomography scans were used to assess the required graft's volume and to detect resorption. We performed vomerine ostectomy and placed and fixed the bone graft in with a lag screw over the alar base depression. RESULTS: The nostril width showed a significant increase, in addition to the height/width ratio. The columellar angle with the lateral lip height increased remarkably, with a general improvement in the nasal tip aesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: The vomer bone graft has been shown to correct the lateral and inferior disorientation of the alar base and improve the nostril and nasal tip aesthetic measurements. The vomer bone is therefore a sufficient bone source for grafting with high viability and no resorption.","Elfeki B., Elhussiny Khater A.M., Bahaa El-Din A.M., Shouman O.O., Baek R.-M., Kim B.-K.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000002432,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Analysis Of Distribution And Drug Resistance Of Pathogens Of Burn Patients During 9 Years,"Objective: To investigate distribution and drug resistance of pathogens of burn patients. Methods: A total of 3 357 strains were cultured and isolated from 25 286 specimens of wounds excretion, deep venous catheters, venous blood, stool, mid-stream urine, sputum, puncture fluid, and throat swab of 11 510 burn patients hospitalized in our burn wards from January 2007 to December 2015. After being identified by API bacteria identification panels and automatically bacteria identification equipment, drug-resistances of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to 28 common antibiotics were tested by drug sensitivity test with K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.6 software was used to analyze constituent ratio of gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria in each year, distribution of pathogens in each year, and drug resistance of the above-mentioned 4 pathogens in 9 years to 28 common antibiotics. Data were analyzed by the linear model curve fitting. Results: (1) From 2007 to 2015, constituent ratios of gram-negative bacteria were respectively 41.22% (101/245), 41.88% (165/394), 45.92% (169/368), 42.54% (208/489), 52.35% (267/510), 56.89% (194/341), 58.99% (210/356), 56.95% (172/302), and 50.28% (177/352), with significantly increasing trend (R(2)=0.625, P<0.05); constituent ratios of gram-positive bacteria were respectively 58.78% (144/245), 58.12% (229/394), 54.08% (199/368), 57.46% (281/489), 47.65% (243/510), 43.11% (147/341), 41.01% (146/356), 43.05% (130/302), 49.72% (175/352), with significantly decreasing trend (R(2)=0.625, P<0.05). In 9 years, constituent ratio of Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first in all bacteria, and constituent ratios of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were with significantly increasing trend (R(2)=0.811, 0.778, P<0.01). (2) In 9 years, drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to gentamycin and rifampicin were with significantly decreasing trend (R(2)=0.727, 0.766, P<0.01); drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to phosphonomycin were always in lower levels of 4.6% to 19.5%. In 9 years, drug-resistant rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin had no significant change in trend (R(2)=0.023, <0.001, P>0.05), while drug-resistant rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to other 10 common antibiotics were with significantly increasing trend (R(2)=0.764, 0.793, 0.785, 0.768, 0.752, 0.749, 0.789, 0.786, 0.706, 0.629, P<0.01). In 9 years, drug-resistant rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam was with significantly decreasing trend (R(2)=0.652, P<0.01), and drug-resistant rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to amikacin was with significantly increasing trend ( R(2)=0.531, P<0.05). In 9 years, drug-resistant rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to piperacillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, and gentamicin were with obviously increasing trend (R(2)=0.481, 0.672, 0.694, 0.532, 0.810, 0.641, 0.809, 0.709, 0.579, 0.810, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: Constituent ratios of gram-positive bacteria of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae of burn patients hospitalized in our burn wards from 2007 to 2015 were significantly increased, while constituent ratios of Staphylococcus aureus of those children always ranked the first. Drug-resistence of bacteria of those children in our burn wards was serious. Drug-resistant rate of Staphylococcus aureus only to phosphonomycin was always in lower level. Drug-resistant rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 10 common antibiotics except ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin were significantly increased. Drug-resistant rate of Acinetobacter baumannii only to ampicillin/sulbactam was significantly decreased. Drug-resistant rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to most common antibiotics were significantly increased.","Dou Y., Zhang Q.",10.3760/cma.j.issn.1009-2587.2018.03.008,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns

Multi-Kinase Inhibitors And Cisplatin For Head And Neck Cancer Treatment In Vitro,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains one of the major causes of suboptimal outcome following therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are overexpressed in HNSCC, which contributes to the limited effect of chemotherapeutic treatment. In addition to their named function, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been revealed to impact on ABC transporter activity and expression. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of combination therapy using different TKIs combined with cisplatin. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to characterize ABC transporter and receptor expression in 5 HNSCC cell lines treated with 3 different TKIs (pazopanib, dovitinib, nintedanib) and cisplatin. Treatment efficacy was analyzed using a crystal violet staining assay. Analysis of ABC transporter (ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2) genetic alterations was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of mono- and combination treatment. With the exception of ABCB1, all of the investigated ABC transporters were expressed in each cell line. The additive effects of TKI + cisplatin combination treatment were observed for pazopanib in three cell lines, nintedanib in four cell lines, and were not observed for dovitinib in any of the cell lines investigated. The combination of multi-kinase inhibitors and conventional chemotherapy in HNSCC may strengthen the use of current therapeutic strategies; nintedanib appears to be the most suitable TKI for combination therapy. Further efforts are required to classify TKI efficacy with regard to cisplatin resistance.","Brands R.C., De Donno F., Knierim M.L., Steinacker V., Hartmann S., Seher A., Kübler A.C., Müller-Richter U.D.A.",10.3892/ol.2019.10541,Oncology Letters
Infected Diabetic Wound Regeneration Using Peptide-Modified Chiral Dressing To Target Revascularization,"Revascularization plays a critical role in the healing of diabetic wounds. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and refractory multidrug resistant bacterial infection are the two major barriers to revascularization, directly leading to impaired healing of diabetic wounds. Here, an artfully designed chiral gel dressing is fabricated (named as HA-LM2-RMR), which consists of l-phenylalanine and cationic hexapeptide coassembled helical nanofibers cross-linked with hyaluronic acid via hydrogen bonding. This chiral gel possesses abundant chiral and cationic sites, not only effectively reducing AGEs via stereoselective interaction but also specifically killing multidrug resistant bacteria rather than host cells since cationic hexapeptides selectively interact with negatively charged microbial membrane. Surprisingly, the HA-LM2-RMR fibers present an attractive ability to activate sprouted angiogenesis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells by upregulating VEGF and OPA1 expression. In comparison with clinical Prontosan Wound Gel, the HA-LM2-RMR gel presents superior healing efficiency in the infected diabetic wound with respect to angiogenesis and re-epithelialization, shortening the healing period from 21 days to 14 days. These findings for chiral wound dressing provide insights for the design and construction of diabetic wound dressings that target revascularization, which holds great potential to be utilized in tissue regenerative medicine.","Xing C., Zhu H., Dou X., Gao L., Baddi S., Zou Y., Zhao C., Peng Y., Fang Y., Feng C.-L.",10.1021/acsnano.2c10039,Acs Nano
Gold—Polyoxoborates Nanocomposite Prohibits Adsorption Of Bacteriophages On Inner Surfaces Of Polypropylene Labware And Protects Samples From Bacterial And Yeast Infections,"Bacteriophages (phages) are a specific type of viruses that infect bacteria. Because of growing antibiotic resistance among bacterial strains, phage-based therapies are becoming more and more attractive. The critical problem is the storage of bacteriophages. Recently, it was found that bacteriophages might adsorb on the surfaces of plastic containers, effectively decreasing the titer of phage suspensions. Here, we showed that a BOA nanocomposite (gold nanoparticles embedded in polyoxoborate matrix) deposited onto the inner walls of the containers stabilizes phage suspensions against uncontrolled adsorption and titer decrease. Additionally, BOA provides antibacterial and antifungal protection. The application of BOA assures safe and sterile means for the storage of bacteriophages.","Wdowiak M., Ochirbat E., Paczesny J.",10.3390/v13071206,Viruses

Adhesion And Biofilm Formation By Staphylococcus Aureus Clinical Isolates Under Conditions Relevant To The Host: Relationship With Macrolide Resistance And Clonal Lineages,"Purpose. Staphylococcus aureus isolates, collected from various clinical samples, were analysed to evaluate the contribution of the genetic background of both erythromycin-resistant (ERSA) and-susceptible (ESSA) S. aureus strains to biofilm formation. Methods. A total of 66 ESSA and 43 ERSA clinical isolates were studied for adhesiveness and biofilm formation under different atmospheres. All isolates were evaluated for phenotypic and genotypic macrolide resistance, and for clonal relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and by spa typing on representative isolates. Results. A high genetic heterogeneity was encountered, although 10 major PFGE types accounted for 86 % with a few small spatially and temporally related clusters. Overall, biofilm formation under anoxia was significantly lower than under oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres. Biofilm formation by ESSA was significantly higher compared to ERSA under oxic and micro-aerophilic conditions. Adhesiveness to plastic was significantly higher among respiratory tract infection isolates under micro-aerophilic conditions, while surgical site infection isolates formed significantly higher biomass of biofilm under oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres compared to anoxia. Pulsotype 2 and 4 strains formed significantly higher biofilm biomass than pulsotype 1, with strains belonging to CC8 forming significantly more compared to those belonging to CC5, under both oxic and micro-aerophilic atmospheres. Conclusions. S. aureus biofilm formation appears to be more efficient in ESSA than ERSA, associated with specific S. aureus lineages, mainly CC8 and CC15, and affected by atmosphere.

They can lead to increases in hospital stays, therapy costs, repeat surgeries, and implant removal. If not handled properly, these wounds have a very poor prognosis and will cause serious physical and psychological harm to patients, which may result in medicolegal disputes. In recent years, the incidence of iatrogenic wounds has increased because of (1) an increase in the population of older people owing to increased life expectancy, (2) the continued expansion of surgical indications, (3) an increase in difficult surgeries, and (4) the constant emergence and application of new implantable biomaterials and other therapies. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to improve the therapy of iatrogenic wounds. However, the difficulty in treating these wounds is considerable due to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, the high number of patients with metabolic diseases, and complex complications in patients. In particular, iatrogenic wounds caused by surgical site infections due to implantable biomaterials could lead to material leakage and conflicts regarding whether to retain or remove the implants. This review provides a definition of iatrogenic wounds, describes their characteristics, classifies them, and provides information about the importance of analyzing iatrogenic wounds. We hope that this review will provide useful information for the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic wounds and help to reduce their incidence in the future.","Cheng B., Tian J., Peng Y., Fu X.",10.1186/s41038-019-0155-2,Burns And Trauma
Integrative Analysis Of Aging-Related Genes Reveals Cebpa As A Novel Therapeutic Target In Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Background: To explore the impact of ARGs on the prognosis of NSCLC, and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and immune microenvironment. Preliminary research on the biological functions of CEBPA in NSCLC. Methods: Using consensus clustering analysis to identify molecular subtypes of ARGs in NSCLC patients; employing LASSO regression and multivariate Cox analysis to select 7 prognostic risk genes and construct a prognostic risk model; validating independent prognostic factors of NSCLC using forest plot analysis; analyzing immune microenvironment correlations using ESTIMATE and ssGSEA; assessing correlations between prognostic risk genes via qPCR and Western blot in NSCLC; measuring mRNA and protein expression levels of knocked down and overexpressed CEBPA in NSCLC using CCK-8 and EdU assays; evaluating the effects of knocked down and overexpressed CEBPA on cell proliferation using Transwell experiments; examining the correlation of CEBPA with T cells and B cells using mIHC analysis. Results: Consensus clustering analysis identified three molecular subtypes, suggesting significant differential expression of these ARGs in NSCLC prognosis and clinical pathological parameters. There was significant differential expression between the two risk groups in the prognostic risk model, with P < 0.001. The risk score of the prognostic risk model was also P < 0.001. CEBPA exhibited higher mRNA and protein expression levels in NSCLC cell lines. Knockdown of CEBPA significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of CEBPB, YWHAZ, ABL1, and CDK1 in H1650 and A549 cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CEBPA markedly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells, whereas overexpression of CEBPA showed the opposite trend. mIHC results indicated a significant increase in CD3 + CD4+, CD3 + CD8+, and CD20 + cell counts in the high CEBPA expression group. Conclusions: The risk score of the prognostic risk model can serve as an independent prognostic factor, guiding the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. CEBPA may serve as a potential tumor biomarker and immune target, facilitating further exploration of the biological functions and immunological relevance in NSCLC.","Zhu J., Zhu X., Shi C., Li Q., Jiang Y., Chen X., Sun P., Jin Y., Wang T., Chen J.",10.1186/s12935-024-03457-4,Cancer Cell International
A Combined Aging And Immune Prognostic Signature Predict Prognosis And Responsiveness To Immunotherapy In Melanoma,"Background: Melanoma is the most lethal, and one of the most aggressive forms of cutaneous malignancies, which poor response to treatment has always puzzled clinicians. As is known to all, aging and immune microenvironment are two crucial factors impacting melanoma biological progress through the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, reliable biomarkers for predicting melanoma prognosis based on aging and immune microenvironment and therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoints remain to be determined. Methods: The aging-related genes (ARGs) were obtained from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources and immune-related genes (IRGs) were downloaded from the Immunology database as well as Analysis Portal (ImmPort) database. Next, we initially performed LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression to identify prognostic ARGs and IRGs in the TCGA and GSE65904 datasets, and firstly constructed a novel comprehensive index of aging and immune (CIAI) signature. Finally, in vitro molecular biology experiments were performed to assess the regulatory role of CNTFR in melanoma cell lines proliferation and migration, macrophage recruitment, and M2 polarization. Results: This novel CIAI signature consisted of 7 genes, including FOXM1, TP63, ARNTL, KIR2DL4, CCL8, SEMA6A, and CNTFR, in which melanoma patients in the high-CIAI group had shorter OS, DSS, and PFI, indicating CIAI model served as an independent prognostic index. Moreover, we found the CIAI score was potentially correlated with immune scores, estimate score, immune cell infiltration level, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy effect, and drug sensitivity. Finally, CNTFR might function as oncogenes in melanoma cell lines and the silencing of CNTFR reduced macrophage recruitment and M2 polarization. Conclusion: In this study, we have first presented a novel prognostic CIAI model applied to assess immune checkpoint therapy and the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy agents in melanoma patients. Thus providing a new insight for combating melanoma.","Lv W., Zhan Y., Tan Y., Wu Y., Chen H.",10.3389/fphar.2022.943944,Frontiers In Pharmacology
Cytarabine-Resistant Flt3-Itd Leukemia Cells Are Associated With Tp53 Mutation And Multiple Pathway Alterations—Possible Therapeutic Efficacy Of Cabozantinib,"Internal tandem duplication of FLT3 juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-ITD)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leads to poor clinical outcomes after chemotherapy. We aimed to establish a cytarabine-resistant line from FLT3-ITD-positive MV4-11 (MV4-11-P) cells and examine the development of resistance. The FLT3-ITD mutation was retained in MV4-11-R; however, the protein was underglycosylated and less phosphorylated in these cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, MEK1/2 and p53 increased in MV4-11-R. The levels of Mcl-1 and p53 proteins were also elevated in MV4-11-R. A p53 D281G mutant emerged in MV4-11-R, in addition to the pre-existing R248W mutation. MV4-11-P and MV4-11-R showed similar sensitivity to cabozantinib, sorafenib, and MK2206, whereas MV4-11-R showed resistance to CI-1040 and idarubicin. MV4-11-R resistance may be associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, but not ERK phosphorylation, after exposure to these drugs. The multi-kinase inhibitor cabozantinib inhibited FLT3-ITD signaling in MV4-11-R cells and MV4-11-R-derived tumors in mice. Cabozantinib effectively inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival time in mice bearing MV4-11-R-derived tumors. Together, our findings suggest that Mcl-1 and Akt phosphorylation are potential therapeutic targets for p53 mutants and that cabozantinib is an effective treatment in cytarabine-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","Ko Y.-C., Hu C.-Y., Liu Z.-H., Tien H.-F., Ou D.-L., Chien H.-F., Lin L.-I.",10.3390/ijms20051230,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Effect Of Hydroxyethyl Starch (Hes) Versus 5% Albumin Solution On Intra-Abdominal Pressure In Severe Burn Patients: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial,"Introduction: Massive burn patients are at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) as a complication of resuscitation. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) versus 5% albumin solution on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in massive burn patients. Methods: This was a prospective randomized clinical trial carried on at Ain Shams University (ASU) burn unit for 2 years. Where adult patients with burns more than 20% of TBSA were equally randomized into HES group or albumin group. Results: Fifty-two patients were equally randomized into 2 groups. We found no difference in age, sex, weight, type of burn, and TBSA between the two groups. The mean total resuscitation fluid volume in the first 48 h was 213 ml/kg and 206.2 ml/kg for the HES group and the albumin group respectively (p = 0.674). IAP statistically was non-significantly higher in the HES group. We found no statistical difference between the two groups as regards the renal function tests. Conclusion: Both HES and 5% albumin solution are effective and safe colloids for burn resuscitation. As regards the IAP, it seems that both 5% albumin and HES have comparable effect regarding IAH in severely burn patients. Both HES and 5% albumin were partially equal in terms of renal involvement and vital data stability.","Abdelmotaal A.M., Abdelsalam A.M., Bakry S.A.D., Abdel Hafiez R.H., Mabrouk A.R.",10.1016/j.burns.2023.06.015,Burns
Ecotoxicological Effects Of Microplastics Combined With Antibiotics In The Aquatic Environment: Recent Developments And Prospects,"Both microplastics and antibiotics are commonly found contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics have the ability to absorb antibiotic pollutants in water, but the specific adsorption behavior and mechanism are not fully understood, particularly in relation to the impact of microplastics on toxicity in aquatic environments. We review the interaction, mechanism, and transport of microplastics and antibiotics in water environments, with a focus on the main physical characteristics and environmental factors affecting adsorption behavior in water. We also analyze the effects of microplastic carriers on antibiotic transport and long-distance transport in the water environment. The toxic effects of microplastics combined with antibiotics on aquatic organisms are systematically explained, as well as the effect of the adsorption behavior of microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, the scientific knowledge gap and future research directions related to the interactions between microplastics and antibiotics in the water environment are summarized to provide basic information for preventing and treating environmental risks.

Advancing Sustainable Agriculture Through Multi-Omics Profiling Of Biosolids For Safe Application: A Review,"Biosolids, derived from wastewater treatment processes, are valuable resources for soil amendment in agriculture due to their nutrient-rich composition. However, various contaminants of concern (CEC) such as pharmaceuticals, per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, endocrine disruptive chemicals, surfactants, pathogens, nanoplastics, and microplastics, are also reported in biosolids. The use of biosolids for agriculture may introduce these CEC into the soil, which raises concerns about their environmental and human health impacts. Moreover, the presence of pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Shigella, Giardia, Rotavirus, etc.) even after treatment calls for microbial profiling of biosolids, especially in developing countries. Multi-omics approaches can be used as powerful tools for characterizing microbial communities and highlighting metabolic pathways. Moreover, these approaches also help in predicting the ecological and agronomic effects of biosolids application in agricultural soils. This review discusses the advantages and challenges of using biosolids in agriculture, considering the range of different CEC reported in biosolids. Moreover, the current legislation for the use of biosolids in agriculture is also presented, highlighting the limitations with respect to guidelines for emerging contaminants in biosolids. Furthermore, the role of the multi-omics approach in biosolids management, focusing on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is also assessed. Multi-omics also allows for real-time monitoring, ensuring continuous optimization of biosolids towards changing environmental conditions. This dynamic approach not only enhances the safe use, but also enhances the sustainability of waste management practices, minimizing the negative effects. Finally, the future research directions for integrating the multi-omics approach into biosolid management practices are also suggested. The need for updating the legislative framework, continued innovation to promote sustainable and robust agricultural systems, bringing the process closer to the principles of a circular bioeconomy is also empahasized.","Shukla S., Khan R., Chrzanowski, Vagliasindi F.G.A., Roccaro P.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124292,Journal Of Environmental Management
Pneumococcal Nasopharyngeal Carriage And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Profile In Children Under Five In Southern Ethiopia,"Background: Streptococcus pneumonia causes high morbidity and mortality, particularly in children under five. Nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage predisposes individuals to pneumococcal infection and horizontal spread within the community. Overuse of antibiotics has been linked to increased risk of antimicrobial resistance to S. pneumonia. We investigated NP carriage rate and resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics in under-five children visiting a public referral center in southern Ethiopia. Methods: In total, 413 under 5 children who visited the outpatient department for a health check-up, immunization or acute mild illnesses underwent NP sampling. Parent/caregiver surveys were administered at the clinic. Sterile plastic applicator rayon tipped swabs were used for NP sampling. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using modified the disk diffusion method. Results: S. pneumonia NP carriage was observed in 39% [95% confidence interval (CI): 34.4-43.8]. Living with one or more sibling (AOR (adjusted odds ratio) 1.95: 95% CI: 1.01, 3.76), age group of 3-23 months (AOR 2.31: 95% CI: 1.07, 4.98), co-sleeping with family (AOR 2.09, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.79), attendance at kindergarten/day-care (AOR 1.84: 95% CI: 1.09, 3.11) and malnutrition independently increased S. pneumonia carriage at the individual level. S. pneumonia was highly resistant to Oxacillin (38.5%), Tetracycline (37.3%), and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (34.2%). Multi-drug resistance was observed in 42.2% of isolates. Conclusions: A high streptococcal NP carriage rate was observed in under-five children. The high level of resistance to commonly used antibiotics calls for enhancing national surveillance of resistance patterns and enforce antibiotic stewardship efforts.","Hussen S., Asnake S., Wachamo D., Tadesse B.T.",10.12688/f1000research.27583.3,F1000Research
Skin Perfusion Changes Within 12 H After Axillary Plexus Block,"Background/Purpose: An improvement of the blood flow would be beneficial in microvascular upper-extremity reconstruction and in digit replantation. In the present work, skin perfusion changes and their duration due to axillary plexus block were quantified. Methods: The peripheral blood flow of the upper extremities in 20 patients undergoing trapeziectomy under axillary plexus block was analyzed. Results: Laser Doppler spectrophotometry was used to measure perfusion factors over a 12-h period, with the contralateral hand acting as the control. Axillary plexus block produced a significant increase of peripheral oxygen saturation (117 ± 35% vs. control 93 ± 22%, p = 0.019), peripheral blood flow (220 ± 166% vs. 130 ± 77%, p = 0.037), and velocity (164 ± 58% vs. 117 ± 45%, p = 0.011). Conclusion: Axillary plexus block produces an improvement of peripheral tissue oxygen saturation of the upper extremities over the first 6 h after the inception of anesthesia.

Mmp1 Expression Is Activated By Slug And Enhances Multi-Drug Resistance (Mdr) In Breast Cancer,"High matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression is associated with enhanced breast cancer growth and metastasis and also might predict poor prognosis. In this study, we further investigated the functional role of MMP1 and how it is upregulated in multi-drug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cells. By retrieving microarray data in GEO datasets and the survival data in the Kaplan Meier plotter, we observed that MMP1 is significantly upregulated in MCF-7/ADR cells compared to the parental MCF-7 cells, while high MMP1 expression is associated with worse overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) in breast cancer patients after systematic therapy. Functional studies showed that MMP1 overexpression significantly reduced the drug sensitivity in MCF-7 cells, while MMP1 knockdown substantially enhanced the sensitivity in MCF-7/ADR cells. By performing western blotting and immunofluorescent staining, we confirmed that MCF-7/ADR cells had enhanced mesenchymal properties than MCF-7 cells. In MCF-7 cells, enforced Slug expression resulted in significant MMP1 upregulation, while in MCF-7/ADR cells, Slug knockdown led to reduced MMP1 expression. By performing bioinformatic analysis, we observed that the promoter of MMP1 has three putative Slug binding sites. The following dual luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR verified these three binding sites. Therefore, we infer that Slug enhances MMP1 transcription via directly binding to the promoter region in breast cancer cells, which is a previously unrecognized mechanism in the development of MDR.","Shen C.-J., Kuo Y.-L., Chen C.-C., Chen M.-J., Cheng Y.-M.",10.1371/journal.pone.0174487,Plos One
Transcriptomic And Histological Analysis Of Exacerbated Immune Response In Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa In A Murine Model Of Endophthalmitis,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) endophthalmitis is a serious threat to the whole spectrum of therapeutic procedures associated with the risk of managing and preventing vision loss. We have earlier shown the interplay of immune mediators in patients with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) endophthalmitis leading to worse outcome. Expanding on these findings, a murine model of endophthalmitis was developed to explore the effects of drug resistance on the pathogenesis by analyzing the temporal changes in retinal morphology along with its transcriptomic signatures. Clinical isolates of susceptible (S-PA) and multidrug-resistant PA (MDR-PA) were injected intravitreally in C57BL/6 mice followed by enucleation at 6 and 24 h time points postinfection. Disease progression and retinal changes were monitored by clinical and histological assessment and transcriptome analysis in a pair-wise manner. Histological assessment of MDR-PA eyeball revealed higher disease severity (p < 0.05), CD45+ cells (p = 0.007), MPO+ cells (p = 0.01), GFAP+ (p = 0.02), along with higher retinal cell death in mice infected with MDR-PA (p = 0.008). Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of nearly 923 genes at 6 h p.i. and 2,220 genes at 24 h p.i. (FC ≥2, adjusted p-value <0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis identified differential regulation of chemokine- and cytokine-mediated, MAPK, and NF-кβ signaling pathways. In conclusion, rapid deterioration of retinal architecture and immune exacerbation was significantly associated with the MDR endophthalmitis, suggesting the need for immunomodulatory agents to strengthen host cell functions and support antibiotics to save the retinal structure from inevitable deterioration and restoration of the vision.","Naik P., Pandey S., Naik M.N., Mishra D.K., Boyenpally S.R., Joseph J.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.789023,Frontiers In Immunology
An Efficient And Novel Technology For The Extraction Of Parasite Genomic Dna From Whole Blood Or Culture,"The aim of this study was to assess pathogen DNA extraction with a new spin column-based method (DNA-XT). DNA from either whole-blood samples spiked with Plasmodium falciparum or Leishmania donovani amastigote culture was extracted with DNA-XT and compared with that produced by a commercial extraction kit (DNeasy(®)). Eluates from large and small sample volumes were assessed by PCR and spectroscopy. Using a small volume (5 μl) of blood, the DNA-XT and DNeasy methods produced eluates with similar DNA concentrations (0.63 vs 1.06 ng/ μl, respectively). The DNA-XT method produced DNA with lower PCR inhibition than DNeasy. The new technique was also twice as fast and required fewer plastics and manipulations but had reduced total recovered DNA compared with DNeasy.","Clark D.J., Moore C.M., Flanagan M., Van Bocxlaer K., Piperaki E.-T., Yardley V., Croft S.L., Tyson J., Whitehouse S.P., O'Halloran J., Krishna S., Staines H.M.",10.2144/btn-2019-0086,Biotechniques
Hopeless Neuroma—The Neurotized Free Flap Tissue Augmentation As Salvage Therapy—A Concept And Clinical Demonstration,"Therapy-resistant neuroma pain is a devastating condition for patients and surgeons. Although various methods are described to surgically deal with neuromas, some discontinuity and stump neuroma therapies have anatomical limitations. It is widely known that a neurotizable target for axon ingrowth is beneficial for dealing with neuromas. The nerve needs “something to do”. Furthermore, sufficient soft tissue coverage plays a major role in sufficient neuroma therapy. We aimed, therefore, to demonstrate our approach for therapy of resistant neuromas with insufficient tissue coverage using free flaps, which are sensory neurotized via anatomical constant branches. The central idea is to provide a new target, a new “to do” for the painful mislead axons, as well as an augmentation of deficient soft tissues. As indication is key, we furthermore demonstrate clinical cases and common neurotizable workhorse flaps.","Aman M., Glaser J.J., Boecker A.H., Thielen M., Eisa A., Bigdeli A.K., Gazyakan E., Kneser U., Harhaus L.",10.3390/jpm13020313,Journal Of Personalized Medicine

A Site-Specific Integrative Plasmid Found In Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Clinical Isolate Hs87 Along With A Plasmid Carrying An Aminoglycoside-Resistant Gene,"Plasmids play critical roles in bacterial fitness and evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here two plasmids found in a drug-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolate HS87 were completely sequenced. The pHS87b plasmid (11.2 kb) carries phage-related genes and function-unknown genes. Notably, pHS87b encodes an integrase and has an adjacent tRNA(Thr)-associated attachment site. A corresponding integrated form of pHS87b at the tRNA(Thr) locus was identified on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa, showing that pHS87b is able to site-specifically integrate into the 3'-end of the tRNA(Thr) gene. The pHS87a plasmid (26.8 kb) displays a plastic structure containing a putative replication module, stability factors and a variable region. The RepA of pHS87a shows significant similarity to the replication proteins of pPT23A-family plasmids. pHS87a carries a transposon Tn6049, a truncated insertion sequence ΔIS1071 and a Tn402-like class 1 integron which contains an aacA4 cassette that may confer aminoglycoside resistance. Thus, pHS87b is a site-specific integrative plasmid whereas pHS87a is a plastic antibiotic resistance plasmid. The two native plasmids may promote the fitness and evolution of P. aeruginosa.","Bi D., Xie Y., Tai C., Jiang X., Zhang J., Harrison E.M., Jia S., Deng Z., Rajakumar K., Ou H.-Y.",10.1371/journal.pone.0148367,Plos One

A Fully Sealed Plastic Chip For Multiplex Pcr And Its Application In Bacteria Identification,"Multiplex PCR is an effective tool for simultaneous multiple target detection but is limited by the intrinsic interference and competition among primer pairs when it is performed in one reaction tube. Dividing a multiplex PCR into many single PCRs is a simple strategy to overcome this issue. Here, we constructed a plastic, easy-to-use, fully sealed multiplex PCR chip based on reversible centrifugation for the simultaneous detection of 63 target DNA sequences. The structure of the chip is quite simple, which contains sine-shaped infusing channels and a number of reaction chambers connecting to one side of these channels. Primer pairs for multiplex PCR were sequentially preloaded in the different reaction chambers, and the chip was enclosed with PCR-compatible adhesive tape. For usage, the PCR master mix containing a DNA template is pipetted into the infusing channels and centrifuged into the reaction chambers, leaving the infusing channels filled with air to avoid cross-contamination of the different chambers. Then, the chip is sealed and placed on a flat thermal cycler for PCR. Finally, amplification products can be detected in situ using a fluorescence scanner or recovered by reverse centrifugation for further analyses. Therefore, our chip possesses two functions: 1) it can be used for multi-target detection based on end-point in situ fluorescence detection; and 2) it can work as a sample preparation unit for analyses that need multiplex PCR such as hybridization and target sequencing. The performance of this chip was carefully examined and further illustrated in the identification of 8 pathogenic bacterial genomic DNA samples and 13 drug-resistance genes. Due to simplicity of its structure and operation, accuracy and generality, high-throughput capacity, and versatile functions (i.e., for in situ detection and sample preparation), our multiplex PCR chip has great potential in clinical diagnostics and nucleic acid-based point-of-care testing.","Xu Y., Yan H., Zhang Y., Jiang K., Lu Y., Ren Y., Wang H., Wang S., Xing W.",10.1039/c5lc00244c,Lab On A Chip
Ecological Influences Of The Migration Of Micro Resin Particles From Crushed Waste Printed Circuit Boards On The Dumping Soil,"About 0.8 million tons of resin particles, which were generated from the recovery of waste printed circuit boards, were dumped on soil at Qingyuan city of China. Resin particles not only belong to micro plastic but also contain brominated flame retardants and heavy metals. There is little information about soil pollution caused by the dumped resin particles. This study found resin particles would transfer from soil surface into soil at least 10 mm downward for six months. Average content of bromine in soil within 10 cm exceeded 2500 mg/kg. The highest content of Pb, Zn, and Cu was 3450, 1143 and 1450 mg/kg, which were approximately 6.9, 2.3 and 3.6 times as much as Grade III soil standard of China. Micro plastic, brominated flame retardants, and heavy metals made significant effects on soil bacterial community. Bacterial diversity was destroyed and the number of resistant bacteria increased obviously such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Paracoccus. This paper presented the ecological destroy of soil when the resin particles were deposited on soil surface. It also suggested the government to urgently manage the resin particles produced in the recovery of waste printed circuit boards.","Li Y., Lin M., Ni Z., Yuan Z., Liu W., Ruan J., Tang Y., Qiu R.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121020,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Rotation Advancement Keystone Flap For Closure Of Large Myelomeningocele Defects,"INTRODUCTION: Myelomeningocele is the most common form of neural tube anomalies. Early reliable skin coverage should be achieved to reduce central nervous system infections. The keystone flaps are gaining popularity for myelomeningocele defect reconstruction. However, the use of a traditional keystone flap is limited in very wide or transversely oriented myleomeningocele defects with inadequate lateral tissue laxity. In this study, we present our successful experience using modified rotation advancement keystone flaps for closure of the transversely oriented myelomeningocele defects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2019 and April 2020, the modified rotation advancement keystone flap was used for reconstruction of transversely oriented myelomeningocele defect in 7 patients (5 males and 2 females) with average age of 14 days. The localization of the lesions was lumbosacral in 5 patients and thoracolumbar in 2 patient. The average myelomeningocele defect width was 6.4 cm, whereas the average defect length was 5.7 cm. The following information was evaluated: the flap dimensions, operative time, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: All patients had uneventful operations, except for 1 case of superficial epidermolysis over flap tip, which settled with conservative wound management. Immediate venous congestion was detected in 2 patients that completely resolved. Otherwise, all wounds healed without any evidence of complications. The mean follow-up was 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conventional keystone flap seems to have geometric constraints to close a transversally oriented myelomeningocele defect, the modified rotation advancement keystone flap serves as a superior alternative and effective option for closure transversally oriented defect.","Hifny M.A., Hamdan A.R., Tayel A.M., El Khateeb E.E.-S., Yagi S., Park T.H.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000003150,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Does Presurgical Taping Change Nose And Lip Aesthetics In Infants With Unilateral Cleft Lip And Palate? A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of taping alone in changing nose and lip aesthetics in infants with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate before and after surgical lip repair. METHODS: The study design was a prospective, balanced, randomized, parallel-group, single-blinded, controlled trial. All the steps were carried out in the Department of Orthodontics of Cairo University in Egypt. Thirty-one infants with nonsyndromic unilateral complete cleft lip and palate were randomly assigned to either no treatment (control) or taping groups. In the taping group, all infants received horizontal tape between the two labial segments, aiming to decrease the cleft gap. No other interventions were performed in this group. Standardized photographs and videos were taken of the infants in both groups at the beginning of the treatment (T1), directly before surgical lip repair (T2), and 2 weeks after surgical lip repair (T3). Photographs and shots from videos were calibrated and used for outcome assessment. Blinded assessors carried out all the measurements digitally on the standardized photographs at T1, T2, and T3 using computer software. RESULTS: Significant changes in all the measurements were recorded in the taping group at T2 before surgical lip repair in comparison with the control group. At T3, no differences were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Taping is a successful intervention in changing nose and lip aesthetics before surgical lip repair. After surgical lip repair, both groups had matching aesthetics.

Development Of Arg-Based Biodegradable Poly(Ester Urea) Urethanes And Its Biomedical Application For Bone Repair,"Thermal plastic polyurethanes (TPUs), serving as biomaterials, have become increasingly prevalent over time in many fields including artificial blood vessels, pericardial patches and other tissue engineering scaffolds by virtue of well adjustable performance. However, synthetic polyurethanes are, to some extent, inadequate for their cytocompatibility and biological activity owing to high hydrophobicity and lack of active groups. In this study, an amino-terminated bis(L-arginine) alkylene diester extender (L-Arg-8) was synthesized and Arg-based biodegradable poly(ester urea) urethanes (PEUUs) with different content of arginine groups were designed, synthesized and characterized in regard to the amelioration of the biodegradability, hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) with PCL as soft segments. Biodegradability, hydrophilicity and positive surface charges increased after Arginine was introduced. As cytocompatibility was improved, PEUU materials A8-1.2 and A8-1.6 were proved to be suitable for human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) to adhere, grow and proliferate on in vitro. These materials would unlock great potential for the use in tissue engineering and regeneration. Additionally, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were composited to PEUUs for further exploration to the applications in bone tissue. The addition of halloysite nanotubes further stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells in vitro. At the same time, a rat cranial defect model was built to assess effects of repair in vivo. Osteointegration and repair were promoted by patch-implanted groups. A8-1.2 6% HNTs showed the best repair. All the results indicated that Arg-based poly(ester urea) urethanes and the composites were conductive to bone repair.","Zhang Y., Huang K., Yuan Q., Gu Z., Wu G.",10.1166/jbn.2019.2818,Journal Of Biomedical Nanotechnology
Mechanisms Of Inhibition And Recovery Under Multi-Antibiotic Stress In Anammox: A Critical Review,"With the escalating global concern for emerging pollutants, particularly antibiotics, microplastics, and nanomaterials, the potential disruption they pose to critical environmental processes like anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) has become a pressing issue. The anammox process, which plays a crucial role in nitrogen removal from wastewater, is particularly sensitive to external pollutants. This paper endeavors to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the inhibition mechanisms of multi-antibiotic on anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, along with insights into their recovery processes. The paper dives deeply into the various ways antibiotics interact with anammox bacteria, focusing specifically on their interference with the bacteria's extracellular polymers (EPS) - crucial components that maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the cells. Additionally, it explores how anammox bacteria utilize quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms to regulate their community structure and respond to antibiotic stress. Moreover, the paper summarizes effective removal methods for these antibiotics from wastewater systems, which is crucial for mitigating their inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria. Finally, the paper offers valuable insights into how anammox communities can recuperate from multi-antibiotic stress. This includes strategies for reintroducing healthy bacteria, optimizing operational conditions, and using bioaugmentation techniques to enhance the resilience of anammox communities. In summary, this paper not only enriches our understanding of the complex interactions between antibiotics and anammox bacteria but also provides theoretical and practical guidance for the treatment of antibiotic pollution in sewage, ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes.","Ji X., Zhang X., Ju T., Zhou L., Jin D., Wu P.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122754,Journal Of Environmental Management
The Use Of Autologous And Cadaveric Grafts In Rhinoplasty: A Survey Study,"BACKGROUND: Both autologous and cadaveric grafts are often used during rhinoplasty to create volume and provide support. Despite discussion in the literature comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and complication rates between grafting options, it remains unclear which is the superior choice when considering availability, donor site morbidity, and cost. There is a little description of the current use of these materials amongst facial plastic surgeons. METHODS: A 12 question survey was created, and IRB approval was obtained. The survey was distributed to practicing members of the AAFPRS via their membership listserv. RESULTS: 178 respondents completed the survey for an overall response rate of 17.5%. The most common rhinoplasty graft types used by respondents were autologous septal cartilage (96.6%), autologous auricular grafts (93.8%), autologous rib graft (ARG) (75.8%), and cadaveric rib graft (CRG) (56.7%). Patient comorbidities and performing more than 50 rhinoplasties per year were positively correlated with use of CRG grafts and concerns about complications and cost were negatively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: While autologous septal and auricular cartilage remain the most common graft choices amongst surveyed facial plastic surgeons, a majority utilize cadaveric rib grafts in their practice. Patient comorbidities, surgery volume, concerns about graft complications, and cost were the chief factors associated with use of cadaveric grafts amongst survey respondents.

Rational Selection And Use Of Antimicrobials In Patients With Burn Injuries,"Caring for patients with burn injuries is challenging secondary to the acute disease process, chronic comorbidities, and underrepresentation in evidence-based literature. Much current practice relies on extrapolation of guidance from different patient populations and wide variations in universal practices. Identifying infections or sepsis in this hypermetabolic population is imperfect and often leads to overprescribing of antimicrobials, suboptimal dosing, and multidrug resistance. An understanding of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may aid optimization of dosing regimens to better attain treatment targets. This article provides an overview of the current status of burn infection and attempts recommendations for consideration to improve universally accepted care.","Hill D.M., Sinclair S.E., Hickerson W.L.",10.1016/j.cps.2017.02.012,Clinics In Plastic Surgery
Plastic Probe Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Developed For Rapid Fingerprint Profile Of Biological Samples Without Pretreatment,"A triangular-shaped flat plastic substrate probe was prepared for direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for analysis of untreated chemical and biological samples including liquids (Met-Arg-Phe-Ala peptide, reserpine, and dodecyl aldehyde), solids (biological samples, traditional Chinese medicine), and powders (roasted coffee, rhizoma coptidis, lotus plumule, and Schisandra sphenanthera). Quantitative analysis of reserpine in water yielded a detection limit of 1 ng mL-1, dynamic response range within 1-500 ng mL-1, and linearity of signal response ˃0.9925. Compared to the conventional capillary ESI, this plastic probe ESI offers lower cost of analysis (US $0.0056 per probe), higher sensitivity, lower sample consumption, longer signal duration (>6 min), better reproducibility, signal stability, and higher speed of analysis (<10 s per sample, including sample loading). Overall, the results indicate the potential of ESI-MS based on flat plastic probes as a versatile method for simple, sensitive, and stable analysis of untreated biological sample analysis.","Wang S., Shan S., Yang J., Zhou J., Wang G.",10.1007/s00216-023-04947-6,Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry
Identification Of Abcc5 Among Atp-Binding Cassette Transporter Family As A New Biomarker For Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based On Bioinformatics Analysis,"Purpose: Liver cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide, and the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter family has been widely accepted as a cause of multidrug resistance. This study was conducted to explore the potential value and mechanisms of the ABC transporter gene family in the liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Materials and Methods: Data were collected from different public databases. UALCAN, ONCOMINE, and GEPIA were used to retrieve a selection of differently expressed and pathological stage-related genes among the ABC family. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized for grouping, and its prognostic value was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. The co-expression pattern was constructed with UALCAN, and the functional analyses were carried out with DAVID. The correlation between the biomarker and immune infiltration, genetic alteration frequency, and drug sensitivity were explored with TIMER, cBioPortal, GDSC and CTRP, respectively. Finally, tSNE algorithm was used to explore the distribution of ABCC5 expressed cells. Results: Among the ABC transporter family members, ABCC5 was differently expressed and strongly related to the pathological stage of LIHC. PCA divided patients of LIHC into two groups, and Cox analyses demonstrated that ABCC5 was an independent risk factor of LIHC. Functional analyses indicated that the genes were enriched in the pathways of transmembrane transporter, ATPase activity, and bile secretion. ABCC5 is also associated with immune infiltration of cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. The genetic alteration frequency of ABCC5 confirmed its potential value in LIHC. In addition, several drugs were explored and found to be relevant to LIHC. The t-SNE showed that expression of ABCC5 was most concentrated in macrophages, followed by hepatocytes. Conclusion: ABCC5 may facilitate LIHC progression through different mechanisms and be a potential biomarker and target for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of LIHC.","Qiu Y., Li H., Xie J., Qiao X., Wu J.",10.2147/IJGM.S333904,International Journal Of General Medicine
A Prospective Randomized Cost Billing Comparison Of Local Fasciocutaneous Perforator Versus Free Gracilis Flap Reconstruction For Lower Limb In A Developing Economy,"Distal half leg complex wounds are usually a formidable problem that necessitates either local or free flap coverage. The aim of this study was to compare cost billing charges in free Gracilis flap (fGF) and local fasciocutaneous perforator flap (lFPF) in reconstructing complex soft tissue leg and foot defects. Patients and methods Thirty consecutive adult (>15-year-old) patients with soft tissue defects in the leg and/or foot requiring tissue coverage with a flap in the period between 2012 and 2015 were randomly assigned (block randomization) to either an fGF or lFPF procedure. The outcome measures addressed were total billed charges costs, perioperative billed charges cost, partial or complete flap loss, length of hospital stay, inpatient postsurgical care duration, complications, operating time and number of operative scrub staff. Results One patient suffered from complete flap loss in each group. Reconstruction with lFPF showed total lower billed charges costs by 62% (2509 USD) (p < 0.001) and perioperative billed charges cost by 54% (779 USD) (p < 0.001), and shorter total hospital stay (36.5 days; p < 0.001), inpatient postsurgical care duration (6.4 days; p < 0.001), operating time (4.3 h; p < 0.001) and fewer scrub staff (2.2 persons; p < 0.001). Conclusion These results suggest that neither flap is totally superior to the other; the choice should instead be based on the outcome sought and logistics. lFPF requires lower billed charges cost and resource use and saves operative time and personnel and reduces length of hospital stay. Our approach changed towards using perforator flaps in medium-sized defects, keeping the free flap option for larger defects.","Abdelrahman I., Moghazy A., Abbas A., Elmasry M., Adly O., Elbadawy M., Steinvall I., Sjoberg F.",10.1016/j.bjps.2016.04.013,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
Genome Rearrangements In Escherichia Coli During De Novo Acquisition Of Resistance To A Single Antibiotic Or Two Antibiotics Successively,"Background: The ability of bacteria to acquire resistance to antibiotics relies to a large extent on their capacity for genome modification. Prokaryotic genomes are highly plastic and can utilize horizontal gene transfer, point mutations, and gene deletions or amplifications to realize genome expansion and rearrangements. The contribution of point mutations to de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance is well-established. In this study, the internal genome rearrangement of Escherichia coli during to de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance was investigated using whole-genome sequencing. Results: Cells were made resistant to one of the four antibiotics and subsequently to one of the three remaining. This way the initial genetic rearrangements could be documented together with the effects of an altered genetic background on subsequent development of resistance. A DNA fragment including ampC was amplified by a factor sometimes exceeding 100 as a result of exposure to amoxicillin. Excision of prophage e14 was observed in many samples with a double exposure history, but not in cells exposed to a single antibiotic, indicating that the activation of the SOS stress response alone, normally the trigger for excision, was not sufficient to cause excision of prophage e14. Partial deletion of clpS and clpA occurred in strains exposed to enrofloxacin and tetracycline. Other deletions were observed in some strains, but not in replicates with the exact same exposure history. Various insertion sequence transpositions correlated with exposure to specific antibiotics. Conclusions: Many of the genome rearrangements have not been reported before to occur during resistance development. The observed correlation between genome rearrangements and specific antibiotic pressure, as well as their presence in independent replicates indicates that these events do not occur randomly. Taken together, the observed genome rearrangements illustrate the plasticity of the E. coli genome when exposed to antibiotic stress.","Hoeksema M., Jonker M.J., Bel K., Brul S., Ter Kuile B.H.",10.1186/s12864-018-5353-y,Bmc Genomics
"Incidence, Risk Factors, And Outcome Of Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Acquisition During An Outbreak In A Burns Unit","Background: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MR-AB) can cause outbreaks in a burns unit. Aim: To study the incidence, risk factors and outcome of MR-AB colonization during an outbreak. Methods: A prospective study was conducted from April to November 2014 in a burns unit in Paris. Weekly surveillance cultures of patients and their environment were performed. MR-AB acquisition, discharge, or death without MR-AB colonization were considered as competing events. To identify risk factors for colonization, baseline characteristics and time-dependent variables were investigated in univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox models. MR-AB strains were genotypically compared using multi-locus sequence typing. Findings: Eighty-six patients were admitted in the burns unit during the study period. Among 77 patients without MR-AB colonization at admission, 25 (32%) acquired MR-AB with a cumulative incidence of 30% at 28 days (95% CI: 20–40). Median time to MR-AB acquisition was 13 days (range: 5–34). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for MR-AB acquisition were ≥2 skin graft procedures performed [hazard ratio (HR): 2.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–8.00; P = 0.032] and antibiotic therapy during hospitalization (HR: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.19–16.4; P = 0.026). A major sequence type of MR-AB (ST2) was found in 94% and 92% of patients and environmental strains, respectively, with all strains harbouring the blaOXA-23 gene. MR-AB colonization increased length of hospitalization (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.17–0.58; P = 0.0002) by a median of 12 days. Conclusion: A high incidence of MR-AB acquisition was seen during this outbreak with most strains from patients and their environment belonging to single sequence type. MR-AB colonization was associated with more skin graft procedures, antibiotic use, and prolonged hospitalization.","Munier A.-L., Biard L., Rousseau C., Legrand M., Lafaurie M., Lomont A., Donay J.-L., De Beaugrenier E., Flicoteaux R., Mebazaa A., Mimoun M., Molina J.-M.",10.1016/j.jhin.2017.07.020,Journal Of Hospital Infection
No-Drain Single Incision Liposuction Pull-Through Technique For Gynecomastia,"BACKGROUND: Several different methods have been proposed for treatment of gynecomastia, depending on the amount of breast enlargement and skin redundancy. The liposuction pull-through technique has been proposed as an efficacious treatment for many gynecomastia cases. This work aims to study the outcome of this technique when applied as an outpatient procedure, without the use of drains and through a single incision.METHODS: Fifty-two patients with bilateral gynecomastia without significant skin excess were included in this study. The liposuction pull-through technique was performed through a single incision just above the inframammary fold and without the use of drains. Patients were followed up for 6 months.RESULTS: The proposed technique was able to treat the gynecomastia in all patients, with a revision rate of 1.9% to remove residual glandular tissues. There were no seromas, hematomas, nipple distortion, permanent affection of nipple sensation or wound healing problems.CONCLUSION: The liposuction pull-through technique is an effective treatment for gynecomastia without significant skin redundancy. It combines the benefits of the direct excision of glandular tissues, with the minimally invasive nature of liposuction. Performing the procedure through a single incision without the use of drains and without general anesthesia is a safe alternative.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Does Repeated Exposure To Hydrogen Peroxide Induce Candida Auris Resistance?,"Background: To minimize environmental colonization by microorganisms that may persist and thrive in healthcare settings, thus reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), new insights over already known biocides are certainly of relevance. Although the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) against the emergent yeast Candida auris is moderately documented, concerns over the potential induction of resistance after repeated exposure do persist. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the hypothetical induction of Candida auris resistance following 30 days of consecutive exposure to lethal and sublethal concentrations of H(2)O(2). Furthermore, the authors aimed to elucidate about the rank of efficacy of H(2)O(2) against C. auris comparing to other Candida species and whether different strains of C. auris may display different susceptibilities to H(2)O(2). Methods: During the induction of resistance assays, both type strains and clinical isolates of Candida auris, Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis were exposed repeatedly to defined concentrations of H(2)O(2), for 30 days. Results: After that period, no significant differences were found when comparing the minimal inhibitory concentration values of H(2)O(2) in case of the induced strains versus each respective positive control. Moreover, H(2)O(2) displayed similar effectiveness against all the tested Candida species and no differences were demonstrated among the distinct strains of C. auris. Conclusions: The adoption of H(2)O(2) solutions in routine protocols in order to promote disinfection standards against Candida auris, improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs, is certainly welcomed.","Cobrado L., Ricardo E., Ramalho P., Fernandes A.R., Rodrigues A.G.",10.1186/s13756-023-01281-5,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
The First Nationwide Surveillance Of Antibacterial Susceptibility Patterns Of Pathogens Isolated From Skin And Soft-Tissue Infections In Dermatology Departments In Japan,"To investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) at dermatology departments in Japan, a Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey in 2013. Three main organisms were collected from SSTI at 30 dermatology departments in medical centers and 10 dermatology clinics. A total of 860 strains – 579 of Staphylococcus aureus, 240 of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and 41 of Streptococcus pyogenes – were collected and shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The patient profiles were also studied. Among all 579 strains of S. aureus, 141 (24.4%) were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Among 97 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 54 (55.7%) were methicillin-resistant (MRSE). MRSA and MRSE were more frequently isolated from inpatients than from outpatients. Furthermore, these methicillin-resistant strains were also isolated more frequently from patients with histories of taking antibiotics within 4 weeks and hospitalization within 1 year compared to those without. However, there were no significant differences in MIC values and susceptibility patterns of the MRSA strains between patients with a history of hospitalization within 1 year and those without. Therefore, most of the isolated MRSA cases at dermatology departments are not healthcare-acquired, but community-acquired MRSA. S. pyogenes strains were susceptible to most antibiotics except macrolides. The information in this study is not only important in terms of local public health but will also contribute to an understanding of epidemic clones of pathogens from SSTI.","Watanabe S., Ohnishi T., Yuasa A., Kiyota H., Iwata S., Kaku M., Watanabe A., Sato J., Hanaki H., Manabe M., Suzuki T., Otsuka F., Aihara M., Iozumi K., Tamaki T., Funada Y., Shinozaki M., Kobayashi M., Okuda M., Kikyo G., Kikuchi K., Okada Y., Takeshima M., Kaneko O., Ogawa N., Ito R., Okuyama R., Shimada S., Shimizu T., Hatta N., Manabu M., Tsutsui K., Tanaka T., Miyachi Y., Asada H., Furukawa F., Kurokawa I., Iwatsuki K., Hide M., Muto M., Yamamoto O., Niihara H., Takagaki K., Kubota Y., Sayama K., Sano S., Furue M., Kanekura T.",10.1016/j.jiac.2017.05.006,Journal Of Infection And Chemotherapy
Application Of The Biolog System For Characterization Of Serratia Marcescens Ss Marcescens Isolated From Onsite Wastewater Technology (Oswt),"The scope of this study was to apply the Biolog system to identify and characterize a Serratia strain isolated from the surface of black plastic pieces which constitute the fluidized bed filter (onsite wastewater technology, OSWT). The preliminary isolation of the strain was done in the medium with tetracycline at a 16 mg/l concentration. To characterize the isolated strain, the following Biolog methods were applied: (1) EcoPlates microplates for evaluation of physiological profiling, (2) GEN III OmniLog® ID System for identification of the isolate, and (3) phenotypic microarrays (PM) technology for evaluation of sensitivity to antibiotics (PM11 and PM12). Results were recorded using the original OmniLog® software. The Serratia strain was identified as Serratia marcescens ss marcescens with similarity index 0.569. The same identification was obtained by the 16S rDNA analysis. PM analysis showed an enhancement of phenotype (resistance or growth) of this strain to 35 antibiotics. The loss of phenotype (sensitivity or non-growth) was observed only for 5 antibiotics: lomefloxacin (0.4 µg/ml), enoxacin (0.9 µg/ml), nalidixic acid (18.0 µg/ml), paromomycin (25.0 µg/ml) and novobiocin (1100 µg/ml). This study acknowledges that the methods proposed by the Biolog system allow correct and complete identification and characterization of the microbes isolated from different environments. Phenotypic microarrays could be successfully used as a new tool for identification of the multi-antibiotic resistance of bacteria and for determination of the minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC).","Chojniak J., Jałowiecki Ł, Dorgeloh E., Hegedusova B., Ejhed H., Magnér J., Płaza G.",10.18388/abp.2015_1138,Acta Biochimica Polonica
Advances In Sirna Delivery Strategies For The Treatment Of Mdr Cancer,"RNA interference (RNAi) represents a promising therapeutic method that uses siRNA for cancer treatment. Although the RNAi technique has been increasingly used for clinical trials, systemic siRNA delivery into targeted cells is still challenging. The barriers impeding siRNA therapeutics delivery and impacting the treatment outcome must overcome with negligible systemic toxicity for a desirable and successful delivery of siRNA to MDR cancer cells. Nano delivery strategies have been investigated for nanocarrier functionalization, cancer immunotherapy and cancer targeting.

The Adsorption Of Drugs On Nanoplastics Has Severe Biological Impact,"Micro- and nanoplastics can interact with various biologically active compounds forming aggregates of which the effects have yet to be understood. To this end, it is vital to characterize these aggregates of key compounds and micro- and nanoplastics. In this study, we examined the adsorption of the antibiotic tetracycline on four different nanoplastics, made of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and nylon 6,6 (N66) through chemical computation. Two separate approaches were employed to generate relevant conformations of the tetracycline-plastic complexes. In the first approach, we folded the plastic particle from individual polymer chains in the presence of the drug through multiple separate simulated annealing setups. In the second, more biased, approach, the neat plastic was pre-folded through simulated annealing, and the drug was placed at its surface in multiple orientations. The former approach was clearly superior to the other, obtaining lower energy conformations even with the antibiotic buried inside the plastic particle. Quantum chemical calculations on the structures revealed that the adsorption energies show a trend of decreasing affinity to the drug in the order of N66> PS> PP> PE. In vitro experiments on tetracycline-sensitive cell lines demonstrated that, in qualitative agreement with the calculations, the biological activity of tetracycline drops significantly in the presence of PS particles. Preliminary molecular dynamics simulations on two selected aggregates with each plastic served as first stability test of the aggregates under influence of temperature and in water. We found that all the selected cases persisted in water indicating that the aggregates may be stable also in more realistic environments. In summary, our data show that the interaction of micro- and nanoplastics with drugs can alter drug absorption, facilitate drug transport to new locations, and increase local antibiotic concentrations, potentially attenuating antibiotic effect and at the same time promoting antibiotic resistance.","Dick L., Batista P.R., Zaby P., Manhart G., Kopatz V., Kogler L., Pichler V., Grebien F., Bakos V., Plósz B.G., Kolev N.Z., Kenner L., Kirchner B., Hollóczki O.",10.1038/s41598-024-75785-4,Scientific Reports
A Comprehensive Analysis Of Evolution And Underlying Connections Of Water Research Themes In The 21St Century,"This work aimed to reflect the advancements in water-related science, technology, and policy and shed light on future research opportunities related to water through a systematic overview of Water Research articles published in the first 21.5 years of the 21st century. Specific bibliometric analyses were performed to i) reveal the temporal and spatial trends of water-related research themes and ii) identify the underlying connections between research topics. The results showed that while top topics including wastewater (treatment), drinking water, adsorption, model, biofilm, and bioremediation remained constantly researched, there were clear shifts in topics over the years, leading to the identification of trending-up and emerging research topics. Compared to the first decade of the 21st century, the second decade not only experienced significant uptrends of disinfection by-products, anaerobic digestion, membrane bioreactor, advanced oxidation processes, and pharmaceuticals but also witnessed the emerging popularity of PFAS, anammox, micropollutants, emerging contaminants, desalination, waste activated sludge, microbial community, forward osmosis, antibiotic resistance genes, resource recovery, and transformation products. On top of the temporal evolution, distinct spatial evolution existed in water-related research topics. Microplastics and Covid-19 causing global concerns were hot topics detected, while metagenomics and machine learning were two technical approaches emerging in recent years. These consistently popular, trending-up and emerging research topics would most likely attract continuous/increasing research input and therefore constitute a major part of the prospective water-related research publications.","Chen X., Chen H., Yang L., Wei W., Ni B.-J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155411,Science Of The Total Environment
The Impact Of Postoperative Antibiotic And Duration After Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction On Resistance Among Cultured Species,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing presence of literature within plastic surgery that establishes best practice for postoperative antibiotics after implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR), although it has not been widely adopted or translated into clinical practice. This study aims to determine how antibiotic and duration affects patient outcomes. We hypothesize that IBBR patients who receive a longer duration of postoperative antibiotics will demonstrate higher rates of antibiotic resistance as compared with the institutional antibiogram. METHODS: A retrospective chart review included patients who underwent IBBR between 2015 and 2020 at a single institution. Variables of interest included patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical techniques, infectious complications, and antibiograms. Groups were classified by antibiotic (cephalexin, clindamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and duration (≤7 days, 8-14 days, and >14 days). RESULTS: There were a total of 70 patients who experienced infections included in this study. Onset of infection did not differ based on antibiotic during either device implantation (postexpander P = 0.391; postimplant P = 0.234). Antibiotic and duration did not have an established relationship with explantation rate either (P = 0.154). In patients who had Staphylococcus aureus isolated, there was significantly increased resistance to clindamycin when compared with the institutional antibiogram (sensitivities of 43% and 68%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Neither antibiotic nor duration displayed a difference in overall patient outcomes, including explantation rates. In this cohort, S. aureus strains isolated in association with IBBR infections demonstrated a higher level of resistance to clindamycin compared with strains isolated and tested within the broader institution.","Driscoll C.R., Grosser J.A., Davidson A.L., Lloyd K.M., Prabhu S.S., Katz A.J.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000003451,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Current Applications And Future Impact Of Machine Learning In Emerging Contaminants: A Review,"With the continuous release into environments, emerging contaminants (ECs) have attracted widespread attention for the potential risks, and numerous studies have been conducted on their identification, environmental behavior bioeffects, and removal. Owing to the superiority of dealing with high-dimensional and unstructured data, a new data-driven approach, machine learning (ML), has been gradually applied in the research of ECs. This review described the fundamental principle, algorithms, and workflow of ML, and summarized advances of ML applications for typical ECs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, nanoparticles, antibiotic resistance genes, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, microplastics, antibiotics, and pharmaceutical and personal care products). ML methods showed practicability, reliability, and effectiveness in predicting or analyzing the occurrence, distribution, bioeffects, and removal of ECs, and various algorithms and derived models were developed and optimized to obtain better performance. Moreover, the size and homogeneity of the data set strongly influence the application of ML, and choosing the appropriate ML models with different characteristics is crucial for addressing specific problems related to the data sets. Future efforts should focus on improving the quality of data set and adopting more advanced algorithms, developing the potential of quantitative structure-activity relationship, and promoting the applicability domains and interpretability of models. In addition, the development of codeless ML tools will benefit the accessibility of ML models.","Lei L., Pang R., Han Z., Wu D., Xie B., Su Y.",10.1080/10643389.2023.2190313,Critical Reviews In Environmental Science And Technology
Are Antibiotics Needed In Septorhinoplasty? An Evidence-Based Approach,"The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the context of septorhinoplasty (SRP) is a frequently debated topic among plastic surgeons. Most surgeons routinely use antibiotics to prevent the dreaded physical and psychological morbidity of postoperative infections, although this practice is controversial. With antimicrobial resistance becoming a global threat, however, optimizing antibiotic prescribing is essential. The current evidence would suggest that the rate of postoperative infection is low and routine antibiotic use is unnecessary in SRP surgery. Rates range from 0.5 to 2% in simple SRP surgery, majority of which are minor nasal infections which respond to oral antibiotics and do not require hospital admission. In cases of complex SRP, defined as revision cases or where grafts or implants have been utilized, infection rates can be much higher with an incidence of 7 to 11%, and as such utilization of antibiotics is reasonable. When considering the regime to be utilized, a single preoperative dose of intravenous antibiotics has the same efficacy in reducing the incident of postoperative infection as a postoperative 7-day course of oral antibiotics. In the authors' practice, all patients receive a single intravenous dose of antibiotics on induction, and in the case of utilization of a graft from a nonnasal site, this is complimented with an oral course of postoperative antibiotics. With this approach, infections rates are at the lowest range of available published literature.","Mantelakis A., Argiris K., Joshi A., D'Souza A.R.",10.1055/a-1920-0876,Facial Plastic Surgery : Fps
Hand Infections: Epidemiology And Public Health Burden,"Upper extremity infections are common. Most infections can be effectively treated with minor surgical procedures and/or oral antibiotics; however, inappropriate or delayed care can result in significant, long-term morbidity. The basic principles of treating hand infections were described more than a century ago and most remain relevant today. Immunosuppressant medications, chronic health conditions such as diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus, and public health problems like intravenous drug use, have changed the landscape of hand infections and provide new challenges in treatment.","Gundlach B.K., Sasor S.E., Chung K.C.",10.1016/j.hcl.2020.03.001,Hand Clinics
Cutaneous Mycobacterium Abscessus Infection Following Plastic Surgery: Three Case Reports,"Aim: Mycobacterium abscessus is ubiquitous in the environment and seldom causes infections in immunocompetent individuals. However, skin and soft tissue infections caused by M. abscessus have been reported in recent years. Additionally, the cutaneous infections or outbreaks post cosmetic surgery caused by M. abscessus have been increasing due to the popularity of plastic surgery. The main modes of transmission are through contaminated saline, disinfectants, or surgery equipment, as well as close contact between patients. This article describes three patients who were admitted to our hospital between November 2019 and October 2020. They presented with long-term non-healing wounds caused by M. abscessus infection after undergoing plastic surgery. Symptoms presented by the three patients included swelling, ulceration, secretion, and pain. After identification of M. abscessus with Ziehl-Neelsen staining and MALDI-TOF MS system, the patients were treated with surgical debridement and clarithromycin. Conclusion: It is important to note that a long-term wound that does not heal, especially after plastic surgery, should raise suspicion for M. abscessus infection. The infection mechanism in these three patients may have been due to exposure to surgical equipment that was not properly sterilized or due to poor sterile technique by the plastic surgeon. To prevent such infections, it is important to ensure proper sterilization of surgical equipment and saline.","Shen H., Zhang Q., Peng L., Ma W., Guo J.",10.2147/CCID.S445175,"Clinical, Cosmetic And Investigational Dermatology"
Effect Of Decellularized Adipose Tissue Combined With Vacuum Sealing Drainage On Wound Inflammation In Pigs,"Objective: To preliminary explore the effect of decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) combined with vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) on wound inflammation in pigs. Methods: The DAT was prepared through the process of freeze-thaw, enzymatic digestion, organic solvent extraction, and vacuum freeze-drying. The appearance of DAT was observed before and after freeze-drying. HE staining was used to observe its structure and acellular effect. Eighteen male Bama minipigs were recruited, and four dorsal skin soft tissue wounds in diameter of 4 cm were made on each pig and randomly divided into 4 groups for different treatments. The wounds were treated with DAT combined with VSD in DAT/VSD group, DAT in DAT group, VSD in VSD group, and sterile gauze dressing in control group. HE staining was performed at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after treatment. Moreover, the expressions of inflammatory factors [interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)], as well as the phenotypes of M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypic markers [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 (ARG-1)] were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). ELISA was used to determine the content of iNOS and ARG-1. Results: General observation and HE staining showed that DAT obtained in this study had a loose porous structure without cells. The neutrophils of wounds were significantly less in DAT/VSD group than in control group and DAT group ( P<0.05) at 3 days after treatment, and the difference was not significant ( P>0.05) between DAT/VSD group and VSD group. And the neutrophils were significantly less in DAT/VSD group than in other three groups ( P<0.05) at 7, 10, and 14 days. The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS were significantly lower in DAT/VSD group than in other three groups at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days ( P<0.05), while the mRNA expression of ARG-1 was significantly higher in DAT/VSD group than in other three groups ( P<0.05). ELISA showed that the content of iNOS was significantly lower in DAT/VSD group than in other three groups at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days ( P<0.05), while the content of ARG-1 was significantly higher in DAT/VSD group than in other three groups ( P<0.05). Conclusion: DAT combined with VSD can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration during wound healing, regulate the expressions of inflammatory factors and macrophage phenotype, and the effect is better than single use of each and conventional dressing change.","Wang Y., Wei W., Han Y.",10.7507/1002-1892.201904010,Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi = Zhongguo Xiufu Chongjian Waike Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Reparative And Reconstructive Surgery
Metatranscriptome Sequencing Identifies Escherichia Are Major Contributors To Pathogenic Functions And Biofilm Formation In Diabetes Related Foot Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis in the feet of persons with diabetes is clinically challenging and is associated with high rates of amputation. In this study RNA-sequencing was employed to explore microbial metatranscriptomes with a view to understand the relative activity and functions of the pathogen/s responsible for diabetes foot osteomyelitis (DFO). We obtained 25 intraoperative bone specimens from persons with confirmed DFO, observing that Escherichia spp. (7%), Streptomyces spp. (7%), Staphylococcus spp. (6%), Klebsiella spp. (5%) and Proteus spp. (5%) are the most active taxa on average. Data was then subset to examine functions associated with pathogenesis (virulence and toxins), biofilm formation and antimicrobial/multi-drug resistance. Analysis revealed Escherichia spp. are the most active taxa relative to pathogenic functions with K06218 (mRNA interferase relE), K03699 (membrane damaging toxin tlyC) and K03980 (putative peptidoglycan lipid II flippase murJ), K01114 (membrane damaging toxin plc) and K19168 (toxin cptA) being the most prevalent pathogenic associated transcripts. The most abundant transcripts associated with biofilm pathways included components of the biofilm EPS matrix including glycogen synthesis, cellulose synthesis, colonic acid synthesis and flagella synthesis. We further observed enrichment of a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of L-rhamnose (K01710 -dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase rfbB, rmlB, rffG) which was present in all but four patients with DFO.","Radzieta M., Malone M., Ahmad M., Dickson H.G., Schwarzer S., Jensen S.O., Lavery L.A.",10.3389/fmicb.2022.956332,Frontiers In Microbiology
Impact Of An Acinetobacter Baumannii Outbreak On Kidney Events In A Burn Unit: A Targeted Machine Learning Analysis,"Background: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria outbreaks represent a major threat in intensive care units. Patients may then be exposed to drug-related direct toxicity during such outbreaks. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of an outbreak of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (IR-AB) on renal outcomes. Methods: We performed a before-and-after observational study in a French burn intensive care unit during an IR-AB outbreak: a 13-month period before (period A, October 2013-October 2014) and a 13-month period after outbreak control (period B, December 2014-December 2015). A total of 409 patients were included, 195 during period A and 214 during period B. The main endpoint was major adverse kidney events at day 90 (MAKE 90). Secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury (AKI) and persistent renal dysfunction. Results: Incidence of MAKE 90 was 15.9% during period A versus 11.2% during period B (P =.166) and AKI 28.2% versus 18.7% (P =.023). The use of colistin was associated with renal outcomes in univariate analysis. After adjustment of potential confounding factors using a targeted Machine Learning Analysis (ie, IR-AB-related infection, septic shock, severity scores, other nephrotoxics, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine at admission, Staphylococcus aureus), colistin remained associated with the risk of MAKE and AKI (relative risk = 2.909, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.364, 6.204], P =.006 for MAKE 90, and relative risk = 2.14, 95% CI [1.52, 3.02], P<.0001 for AKI). Conclusions: The episode of IR-AB outbreak was associated with an increased risk of kidney events, which appears to be driven by the use of colistin.","Vauchel T., Pirracchio R., Chaussard M., Lafaurie M., Rouveau M., Rousseau C., Benyamina M., Soussi S., Dépret F., Ferry A., Oueslati H., Chaouat M., Mimoun M., Jarlier V., Moreno N., Mebazaa A., Legrand M.",10.1016/j.ajic.2018.09.010,American Journal Of Infection Control
Critical Review: Propensity Of Premise Plumbing Pipe Materials To Enhance Or Diminish Growth Of Legionella And Other Opportunistic Pathogens,"Growth of Legionella pneumophila and other opportunistic pathogens (OPs) in drinking water premise plumbing poses an increasing public health concern. Premise plumbing is constructed of a variety of materials, creating complex environments that vary chemically, microbiologically, spatially, and temporally in a manner likely to influence survival and growth of OPs. Here we systematically review the literature to critically examine the varied effects of common metallic (copper, iron) and plastic (PVC, cross-linked polyethylene (PEX)) pipe materials on factors influencing OP growth in drinking water, including nutrient availability, disinfectant levels, and the composition of the broader microbiome. Plastic pipes can leach organic carbon, but demonstrate a lower disinfectant demand and fewer water chemistry interactions. Iron pipes may provide OPs with nutrients directly or indirectly, exhibiting a high disinfectant demand and potential to form scales with high surface areas suitable for biofilm colonization. While copper pipes are known for their antimicrobial properties, evidence of their efficacy for OP control is inconsistent. Under some circumstances, copper’s interactions with premise plumbing water chemistry and resident microbes can encourage growth of OPs. Plumbing design, configuration, and operation can be manipulated to control such interactions and health outcomes. Influences of pipe materials on OP physiology should also be considered, including the possibility of influencing virulence and antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, all known pipe materials have a potential to either stimulate or inhibit OP growth, depending on the circumstances. This review delineates some of these circumstances and informs future research and guidance towards effective deployment of pipe materials for control of OPs.","Cullom A.C., Martin R.L., Song Y., Williams K., Williams A., Pruden A., Edwards M.A.",10.3390/pathogens9110957,Pathogens
Flexible Hierarchical Wraps Repel Drug-Resistant Gram-Negative And Positive Bacteria,"Healthcare acquired infections are a major human health problem, and are becoming increasingly troublesome with the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. Engineered surfaces that reduce the adhesion, proliferation, and spread of bacteria have promise as a mean of preventing infections and reducing the use of antibiotics. To address this need, we created a flexible plastic wrap that combines a hierarchical wrinkled structure with chemical functionalization to reduce bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and the transfer of bacteria through an intermediate surface. These hierarchical wraps were effective for reducing biofilm formation of World Health Organization-designated priority pathogens Gram positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 87 and 84%, respectively. In addition, these surfaces remain free of bacteria after being touched by a contaminated surface with Gram negative E. coli. We showed that these properties are the result of broad liquid repellency of the engineered surfaces and the presence of reduced anchor points for bacterial adhesion on the hierarchical structure. Such wraps are fabricated using scalable bottom-up techniques and form an effective cover on a variety of complex objects, making them superior to top-down and substrate-specific surface modification methods.","Imani S.M., Maclachlan R., Rachwalski K., Chan Y., Lee B., Mcinnes M., Grandfield K., Brown E.D., Didar T.F., Soleymani L.",10.1021/acsnano.9b06287,Acs Nano
Early Biofilm And Streamer Formation Is Mediated By Wall Shear Stress And Surface Wettability: A Multifactorial Microfluidic Study,"Biofilms are intricate communities of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-produced matrix of extra-polymeric substances (EPS), creating complex three-dimensional structures allowing for liquid and nutrient transport through them. These aggregations offer constituent microorganisms enhanced protection from environmental stimuli—like fluid flow—and are also associated with higher resistance to antimicrobial compounds, providing a persistent cause of concern in numerous sectors like the marine (biofouling and aquaculture), medical (infections and antimicrobial resistance), dentistry (plaque on teeth), food safety, as well as causing energy loss and corrosion. Recent studies have demonstrated that biofilms interact with microplastics, often influencing their pathway to higher trophic levels. Previous research has shown that initial bacterial attachment is affected by surface properties. Using a microfluidic flow cell, we have investigated the relationship between both wall shear stress (τ(w)) and surface properties (surface wettability) upon biofilm formation of two species (Cobetia marina and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We investigated biofilm development on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) membranes, Permanox® slides, and glass slides, using nucleic acid staining and end-point confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that flow conditions affect biomass, maximum thickness, and surface area of biofilms, with higher τ(w) (5.6 Pa) resulting in thinner biofilms than lower τ(w) (0.2 Pa). In addition, we observed differences in biofilm development across the surfaces tested, with LDPE typically demonstrating more overall biofilm in comparison to Permanox® and glass. Moreover, we demonstrate the formation of biofilm streamers under laminar flow conditions within straight micro-channels.","Chun A.L.M., Mosayyebi A., Butt A., Carugo D., Salta M.",10.1002/mbo3.1310,Microbiologyopen
Role Of Antibiotic Treatment After Surgical Debridement Of Superficial Hand Infections In 180 Patients,"Considering the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the lack of recommendations on antibiotic treatment, the present study evaluated the necessity of local and systemic antibiotic therapy in addition to surgical debridement in superficial hand infections. Superficial hand infections were defined as not involving tendons, joints or bone. Data were analyzed for 180 patients, assigned to three study groups according to postoperative antimicrobial treatment. Patients in group I were treated with both systemic and local antibiotics; in group II antimicrobial therapy was limited to local antibiotics in the form of subcutaneous gentamicin bead chains; group III did not receive any antibiotic treatment after surgical debridement. Patients were followed up at two weeks and at three months. Immobilization time and length of stay were longer in group I, but there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of revision rate or recovery of hand function assessed by measurement of finger mobility, grip strength and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score at follow-up. Antibiotic treatment of hand infections should be considered carefully and reserved for specific indications: e.g., severe infections and selected patients such as those with diabetes or immunocompromising diseases.","Ederer I.A., Schreiner J., Stahl S., Daigeler A., Wahler T.",10.1016/j.hansur.2022.02.010,Hand Surgery And Rehabilitation
Comparing The Antimicrobial Effect Of Silver Ion-Coated Silicone And Gentamicin-Irrigated Silicone Sheets From Breast Implant Material,"BACKGROUND: Post-operative infection is a significant complication of breast implant surgery that may require extensive use of antibiotics and surgical interventions. Here, we developed a biomaterial coating that is chemically bonded to silicone implants which delivers antimicrobial ions over time. METHODS: After coating the silicone implants with a ""mediator"" polymer (γ-PGA), the implants were impregnated with silver (Ag) ions. Antimicrobial effects of these implants were assayed with modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The silicone disks were transferred to a plate with fresh bacteria. Control was intended to simulate an intra-operative wash. RESULTS: The Ag-γ-PGA coated silicone demonstrated antimicrobial effects against the most common etiological agents of breast implant infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no effect of inhibition of bacterial growth around the control silicone or the silicone coated only with γ-PGA. The zone of inhibition was generally larger around the Ag-γ-PGA coated silicone as compared to the silicone irrigated with gentamicin, and continued antibacterial effect was also observed at 48 hours in the Ag-γ-PGA coated silicone for all bacteria groups with the exception of P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin-irrigated silicone did not inhibit bacterial growth at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: The observed antibacterial performance of the Ag-γ-PGA coating as compared to simulated intra-operative antibiotic wash is promising and should be further evaluated to develop the next generation of implants with diminished risk for post-operative implant infections.","Heno F., Azoulay Z., Khalfin B., Craddock H.A., Silberstein E., Moran-Gilad J., Rapaport H.",10.1007/s00266-021-02348-7,Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
Necrox-5 Ameliorates Inflammation By Skewing Macrophages To The M2 Phenotype,"This study aimed to evaluate the role of NecroX-5, a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, on the functional plasticity of macrophages and the possible underlying mechanism using RAW264.7 cells, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice, and a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The change in cell morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The expression of CD206, arginase (Arg)-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were examined by western blotting. The production of inflammatory cytokines was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and statistical comparisons were made. The results showed that treatment of RAW264.7 cells with NecroX-5 caused an elongated shape in comparison to non-treated cells. The expression levels of macrophage mannose receptor CD206 and Arg-1, specific markers of M2 cells, were significantly upregulated by NecroX-5 treatment, while those of iNOS (M1 macrophages) was decreased. In addition, NecroX-5 significantly reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, while interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 secretion in the supernatant was significantly enhanced. Treatment with NecroX-5 considerably ameliorated the progression of DSS-induced colitis and significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that NecroX-5 might dampen inflammation by switching the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype due to IL-4 and IL-13 induction.","Nam S.-Y., Shin B.-H., Lee M., Lee S., Heo C.Y.",10.1016/j.intimp.2018.11.017,International Immunopharmacology
"The Role Of Tumor Associated Macrophages (Tams) In Cancer Pro-Gression, Chemoresistance, Angiogenesis And Metastasis-Current Status","Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), located in the tumor microenviron-ment (TME), play a significant role in cancer cell survival and progression. TAMs have been involved in producing immuno-suppressive TME in the tumor by generating inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, etc. TAMs can influence the angiogenesis, metastatic behavior of tumor cells (TCs) and cause multidrug resistance. TAMs within the TME can enhance cancer cell metastasis and are stromal and perivascu-lar. The angiogenesis is promoted at the hypoxia, and the avascular zones of TME. Differentiation states of TAMs are considered ‘plastic’ as they exhibit temporal expression of one or several phenotypes depending on local cues. Emerging cancer research depicted the epigenetic regulation of macrophage polarization (both M1s, M2s) and their potential implications to develop pharmacologic modulators and microRNAs to act as molecular switches and even to serve as targeted therapies to inhibit tumor growth. In the present ar-ticle, the role of TAMs in tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis was discussed. In addition, key signaling cascades regulated by TAMs, which have a role in chemoresistance, were also discussed. Currently, novel pleiotropic properties of various anticancer phytomedicines are gaining importance as they assist in overcoming TAMs-induced che-moresistance. Moreover, these phytomedicines are being tested as ‘adjunct therapeutics’ along with chemotherapeutic agents, anti-angiogenic molecules, anti-metastatic com-pounds, and other immune-checkpoint blockers against tumor metastasis/angiogenesis. Hence, a brief note on natural products targeting TAMs was provided. In summary, this review would benefit pharmacologists and medical professionals to develop therapies to target TAMs using multi-OMICs approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.","Dallavalasa S., Beeraka N.M., Basavaraju C.G., Tulimilli S.V., Sadhu S.P., Rajesh K., Aliev G., Madhunapantula S.V.",10.2174/0929867328666210720143721,Current Medicinal Chemistry
Human Health And Ocean Pollution,"Background: Pollution – unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity – is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.","Landrigan P.J., Stegeman J.J., Fleming L.E., Allemand D., Anderson D.M., Backer L.C., Brucker-Davis F., Chevalier N., Corra L., Czerucka D., Bottein M.-Y.D., Demeneix B., Depledge M., Deheyn D.D., Dorman C.J., Fénichel P., Fisher S., Gaill F., Galgani F., Gaze W.H., Giuliano L., Grandjean P., Hahn M.E., Hamdoun A., Hess P., Judson B., Laborde A., Mcglade J., Mu J., Mustapha A., Neira M., Noble R.T., Pedrotti M.L., Reddy C., Rocklöv J., Scharler U.M., Shanmugam H., Taghian G., Van De Water J.A.J.M., Vezzulli L., Weihe P., Zeka A., Raps H., Rampal P.",10.5334/aogh.2831,Annals Of Global Health
Effectiveness And Role Of Using Hyaluronic Acid Injections For Gluteal Augmentation: A Comprehensive Systematic Review Of Techniques And Outcomes,"INTRODUCTION: There has been a rapid increase in the number of patients undergoing non-surgical gluteal augmentation in recent years, leading to an increase in the number of articles in the literature regarding the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) for gluteal augmentation. No systematic review has been published on the effectiveness of HA for gluteal augmentation. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive review regarding the effectiveness and role of using HA for gluteal augmentation. METHODS: This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We conducted a search across MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, using the following search keywords: gluteus, buttocks, gluteoplasty, gluteal augmentation, hyaluronic acid, and filler. RESULTS: Ten articles published between 2013 and 2022 that included 168 patients. The estimated duration of product effectiveness is 16.16 months. Most studies showed statistically significant improvements in patients' satisfaction. Mean volume of HA injected for optimal gluteal fat augmentation was 206.71 ml. Of included studies, two reported major complications, five patients experienced bruising and erythema as minor complications, five patients experienced effusion and inflammation at the injection site, three patients experienced gel dislocation, and one patient experienced irregular contours. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, HA is a predictable method for gluteal augmentation. Patients were satisfied with their outcomes. Despite gluteal augmentation with HA having a modest complication rate, it can still involve serious complications such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and death. There is a need for further research in a randomized control trial. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

A Cd31-Derived Peptide Prevents The Development Of Antibody-Mediated Lesions In A Rat Model Of Aortic Allograft,"Background: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a major cause of graft loss. The development of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) directed against the allogeneic HLA molecules expressed by the graft also leads to accelerated arteriosclerosis. CD31 is a protein expressed on endothelial and immune cells, ensuring homeostasis at this interface. When strong immune stimulation occurs, the regulatory function of CD31 is lost owing to cleavage of its extracellular portion. P8RI, a synthetic peptide that binds to the ectodomain of CD31, is able to restore the CD31 immunomodulatory function. In this study, we hypothesized that CD31 could represent an attractive molecular target in AMR and investigated whether P8RI could prevent the development of vascular antibody-mediated lesions. Materials and methods: A rat model of orthotopic aortic allograft was used, and P8RI was administered for 28 days. Circulating DSAs were quantified to assess the alloimmune humoral response, and histologic and immunohistochemical analyses of aortic allografts were performed to estimate antibody-mediated lesions in the allograft. Results: Aorta-allografted rats receiving P8RI developed fewer DSAs than control animals (mean fluorescence intensity 344 vs 741). The density of nuclei in the media (3.4 x 10(-5) vs 2.2 x 10(-5) nuclei/px(2)) and media surface area (2.33 x 10(6) vs 2.02 x 10(6) px(2)) were higher in animals treated with P8RI than in control animals. Conclusions: These data support a therapeutic potential for molecules able to restore the CD31 signaling to fight AMR. P8RI, an agonist synthetic peptide targeting CD31, might prevent DSA production and have a beneficial effect in limiting arterial antibody-mediated lesions. CD31 agonists may become therapeutic tools to prevent and treat solid organ transplant arteriosclerosis.","Sannier A., Stroumza N., Atlan M., Even G., Guedj K., Sénémaud J., Coscas R., Caligiuri G., Nicoletti A.",10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.01.003,Transplantation Proceedings
Global Surgery Is Stronger When Infection Prevention And Control Is Incorporated: A Commentary And Review Of The Surgical Infection Landscape,"Incorporating infection prevention and control (IPC) is crucial for strengthening global surgery, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review article highlights the critical role IPC plays in ensuring equitable and sustainable surgical care, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3 and 10, which aim to promote health and reduce inequalities. Surgical site infections (SSIs) and other healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) disproportionately affect LMICs, where IPC infrastructure is often underdeveloped. Without robust IPC measures, surgeries in these regions can result in higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, exacerbating disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Despite global efforts, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on the Prevention of Surgical Site Infections, IPC integration in surgical practices remains inconsistent, particularly in resource-constrained settings. More widespread adoption and implementation are necessary. By embedding IPC within global surgery frameworks, health systems can improve surgical outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the resilience of healthcare systems. Effective IPC reduces extended hospital stays, limits the spread of antimicrobial resistance, and increases trust in surgical services. Moreover, the cost savings from preventing SSIs are substantial, benefiting both healthcare systems and patients by reducing the need for prolonged care and antibiotic treatments. This review article calls for greater integration of IPC measures in global surgery initiatives to ensure that surgical interventions are both life-saving and equitable. Strengthening IPC is not optional but essential for achieving the broader goals of universal health coverage and improving public health outcomes globally.","Hinson C., Kilpatrick C., Rasa K., Ren J., Nthumba P., Sawyer R., Ameh E.",10.1186/s12893-024-02695-7,Bmc Surgery
Environmental Factors Support The Formation Of Specific Bacterial Assemblages On Microplastics,"While the global distribution of microplastics (MP) in the marine environment is currently being critically evaluated, the potential role of MP as a vector for distinct microbial assemblages or even pathogenic bacteria is hardly understood. To gain a deeper understanding, we investigated how different in situ conditions contribute to the composition and specificity of MP-associated bacterial communities in relation to communities on natural particles. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and wooden pellets were incubated for 2 weeks along an environmental gradient, ranging from marine (coastal Baltic Sea) to freshwater (waste water treatment plant, WWTP) conditions. The associated assemblages as well as the water communities were investigated applying high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our setup allowed for the first time to determine MP-dependent and -independent assemblage factors as subject to different environmental conditions in one system. Most importantly, plastic-specific assemblages were found to develop solely under certain conditions, such as lower nutrient concentration and higher salinity, while the bacterial genus Erythrobacter, known for the ability to utilize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), was found specifically on MP across a broader section of the gradient. We discovered no enrichment of potential pathogens on PE or PS; however, the abundant colonization of MP in a WWTP by certain bacteria commonly associated with antibiotic resistance suggests MP as a possible hotspot for horizontal gene transfer. Taken together, our study clarifies that the surrounding environment prevailingly shapes the biofilm communities, but that MP-specific assemblage factors exist. These findings point to the ecological significance of specific MP-promoted bacterial populations in aquatic environments and particularly in plastic accumulation zones.","Oberbeckmann S., Kreikemeyer B., Labrenz M.",10.3389/fmicb.2017.02709,Frontiers In Microbiology
"Homologous Stress Adaptation, Antibiotic Resistance, And Biofilm Forming Ability Of Salmonella Enterica Serovar Heidelberg Atcc8326 On Different Food-Contact Surfaces Following Exposure To Sublethal Chlorine Concentrations1","Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC 8326) was examined for the ability to adapt to the homologous stress of chlorine through exposure to increasing chlorine concentrations (25 ppm daily increments) in tryptic soy broth (TSB). The tested strain exhibited an acquired tolerance to chlorine in TSB with the tolerant cells growing in concentrations up to 400 ppm. In addition, the chlorine stressed cells displayed rugose morphology on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates at 37°C. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chlorine for adapted (rugose and smooth) cells was determined to be 550 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively whereas the MIC for the control was 450 ppm. The biofilm forming ability of the adapted and control cells were examined on both plastic and stainless steel surface at room temperature and 37°C. The rugose variant, in contrast to the smooth (adapted and control) showed the ability to form strong biofilms (P ≤ 0.05) on a plastic surface at room temperature and 37°C. Rugose cells compared to smooth and control attached more (P ≤ 0.05) to steel surfaces as well. The possibility of cross-adaptation was examined by exposing the adapted and control cells to different antibiotics according to the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Adapted cells exhibited reduced susceptibility to some of the antibiotics tested as compared to control. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to sublethal chlorine concentration during the sanitization procedure can result in tolerant Salmonella cells. Chlorine may confer cross-protection that aids in the survival of the tolerant population to other environmental stresses.","Obe T., Nannapaneni R., Sharma C.S., Kiess A.",10.3382/ps/pex346,Poultry Science
Diagnosis And Management Of Hand Infections,"Hand and upper-extremity infections span a broad spectrum of presentations for the hand surgeon, primary care provider, and emergency medicine practitioner. As many hand infections arise from penetrating trauma, knowledge of the offending pathogen, location, and mode of spread allows the clinician to determine the appropriate intervention. Along with a thorough history and physical examination, patient factors such as age, occupation, medical comorbidities, and surgical history should be noted. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management allow for optimal recovery and outcomes. In this article, we describe the ongoing debate regarding the timing and influence of preoperative antibiotics on culture yield, timing of debridement for open fractures as it relates to infection risk, and strategies for obtaining adequate cultures to guide antibiotic therapy for complex infections such as periprosthetic joint and hardware infections. Given the changing epidemiological landscape and increased rates of antibiotic resistance, it is critical to promote antibiotic stewardship. We provide updated treatment recommendations and antibiotic profiles for the treatment of common hand infections. Finally, we discuss newer technologies such as next-generation sequencing and development of promising diagnostic and treatment strategies that will enhance the hand surgeon's ability to treat complex hand infections.","Song E., Seidelman J., Hammert W., Saltzman E.",10.1016/j.jhsa.2024.09.001,Journal Of Hand Surgery
Susceptibility Of Microorganisms Causing Acute Hand Infections,"Hand infections are a common presentation at the emergency departments. Without knowing the source of infection clinicians are dependent on systematic reports on the bacterial spectrum and susceptibility tests of the specific infection in their patient community. This study was based on a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to our outpatient clinic with acute hand infections. We documented patient demographics, the etiology, location, culture tests of the infection and analyzed if certain bacteria could be cultured significantly more often in certain etiologies or in specific sites of the hand infection. Susceptibility tests were added. Bacterial swabs of 204 patients were analyzed. Overall S. aureus was found in 53% of all cases, in only one case revealed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). There was no significant difference in the bacterial spectrum according to the etiology of the hand infections, except for animal bites where Pasteurella multocida was the dominating bacteria in 63% of all cases. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin were effective against the main bacteria. Our study confirms the previously published antibiotic resistance reports and reinforces the current antibiotic treatment guidelines also in this western European population.","Fuchsjäger N., Winterleitner H., Krause R., Feierl G., Koch H.",10.1371/journal.pone.0220555,Plos One
Effect Of Incubation Temperature On Antibiotic Resistance And Virulence Factors Of Acinetobacter Baumannii Atcc 17978,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a notorious opportunistic pathogen that is prevalent mainly in hospital settings. The ability of A. baumannii to adapt and to survive in a range of environments has been a key factor for its persistence and success as an opportunistic pathogen. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature on the clinically relevant phenotypes displayed by A. baumannii at 37Å°C and 28Å°C. Surface-associated motility was significantly reduced at 28Å°C, while biofilm formation on plastic surfaces was increased at 28Å°C. Decreased susceptibility to aztreonam and increased susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were observed at 28Å°C. No differences in virulence, as assayed in a Galleria mellonella model, were observed. Proteomic analysis showed differential expression of 629 proteins, of which 366 were upregulated and 263 were downregulated at 28Å°C. Upregulation of the Csu and iron uptake proteins at 28Å°C was a key finding for understanding some of the phenotypes displayed by A. baumannii at 28°C.","Malaka De Silva P., Chong P., Fernando D.M., Westmacott G., Kumara A.",10.1128/AAC.01514-17,Antimicrobial Agents And Chemotherapy
Covid-19'S Environmental Impacts: Challenges And Implications For The Future,"Strict measures have curbed the spread of COVID-19, but waste generation and movement limitations have had an unintended impact on the environment over the past 3 years (2020–2022). Many studies have summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main environmental topic (i.e., CO(2) emissions) across the 3 years remains unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention than the negative ones (50.6 % versus 35.7 %), especially in emissions reduction (34 % of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 %) received the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global emission reduction, especially in terms of CO(2), has received significant attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in 2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant effect on CO(2) emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international aviation related CO(2) emissions dropped by 59 %, 49 %, and 25 % in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped by only 3.16 % in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix, medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world.","Ang L., Hernández-Rodríguez E., Cyriaque V., Yin X.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165581,Science Of The Total Environment
High-Sensitive Determination Of Tetracycline Antibiotics Adsorbed On Microplastics In Mariculture Water Using Pre-Cof/Monolith Composite-Based In-Tube Solid Phase Microextraction On-Line Coupled To Hplc-Ms/Ms,"Microplastics (MPs) act as carriers for organic pollutants (e.g. antibiotics) and microorganisms (e.g. bacteria) in waters, leading to the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, the antibiotics adsorbed on MPs may exacerbate this process. For further research, it is necessary to understand the types and amounts of antibiotics adsorbed on MPs. However, due to the heavy work of MPs collection and sample pretreatment, there is a lack of analytical methods and relevant data. In this study, an in-tube solid phase microextraction (IT-SPME) on-line coupled to HPLC-MS/MS method based on amorphous precursor polymer of three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks/monolith-based composite adsorbent was developed, which could efficiently capture, enrich and analyze tetracycline (TCs) antibiotics. Under the optimal extraction parameters, the developed method was capable of detecting TCs at levels as low as 0.48–1.76 pg. This method was applied to analyze the TCs adsorbed on MPs of different particle sizes in mariculture water for the first time, requiring a minimum amount of MPs of only 1 mg. Furthermore, it was observed that there could be an antagonistic relationship between algal biofilm and TCs loaded on MPs. This approach could open up new possibilities for analyzing pollutants on MPs and support deeper research on MPs.","Pang J., Chen H., Guo H., Lin K., Huang S., Lin B., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133768,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Improved Prediction Of Bacterial Genotype-Phenotype Associations Using Interpretable Pangenome-Spanning Regressions,"Discovery of genetic variants underlying bacterial phenotypes and the prediction of phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance are fundamental tasks in bacterial genomics. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods have been applied to study these relations, but the plastic nature of bacterial genomes and the clonal structure of bacterial populations creates challenges. We introduce an alignment-free method which finds sets of loci associated with bacterial phenotypes, quantifies the total effect of genetics on the phenotype, and allows accurate phenotype prediction, all within a single computationally scalable joint modeling framework. Genetic variants covering the entire pangenome are compactly represented by extended DNA sequence words known as unitigs, and model fitting is achieved using elastic net penalization, an extension of standard multiple regression. Using an extensive set of state-of-the-art bacterial population genomic data sets, we demonstrate that our approach performs accurate phenotype prediction, comparable to popular machine learning methods, while retaining both interpretability and computational efficiency. Compared to those of previous approaches, which test each genotype-phenotype association separately for each variant and apply a significance threshold, the variants selected by our joint modeling approach overlap substantially. IMPORTANCE Being able to identify the genetic variants responsible for specific bacterial phenotypes has been the goal of bacterial genetics since its inception and is fundamental to our current level of understanding of bacteria. This identification has been based primarily on painstaking experimentation, but the availability of large data sets of whole genomes with associated phenotype metadata promises to revolutionize this approach, not least for important clinical phenotypes that are not amenable to laboratory analysis. These models of phenotype-genotype association can in the future be used for rapid prediction of clinically important phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance and virulence by rapid-turnaround or point-of-care tests. However, despite much effort being put into adapting genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches to cope with bacterium-specific problems, such as strong population structure and horizontal gene exchange, current approaches are not yet optimal. We describe a method that advances methodology for both association and generation of portable prediction models.","Lees J.A., Mai T.T., Galardini M., Wheeler N.E., Horsfield S.T., Parkhill J., Corander J.",10.1128/mBio.01344-20,Mbio
The Anticancer Effects Of Curcumin And Clinical Research Progress On Its Effects On Esophageal Cancer,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common tumor of the gastrointestinal system and a major threat to human health. The etiology and incidence of EC vary depending on the type of pathology. Owing to the unique physiological structure of the esophagus and the poor biological behavior of EC, the treatment modalities available are limited, and the prognosis of patients is relatively poor. Curcumin is a type of natural phytochemical belonging to the class of phenolic compounds. It exerts favorable anticancer effects on various cancers. A growing body of evidence indicates that curcumin suppresses tumor development and progression by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, thus inducing apoptosis, regulating microRNA expression, reversing multidrug resistance, and inducing sensitivity to the therapeutic effect of chemoradiotherapy. Multiple cellular molecules, growth factors, and genes encoding proteins participating in different signaling pathways interact with each other to contribute to the complex and orderly anticancer effect. The efficacy and safety of curcumin have been established in preclinical studies for EC and clinical trials for other cancers. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin limits its clinical application. Therefore, the modification of curcumin analogs, the combination of curcumin with other drugs or therapies, and the use of novel nanocarriers have been widely investigated to improve the clinical effects of curcumin in EC.","Wang S., Gao X., Li J., Wei S., Shao Y., Yin Y., Zhang D., Tang M.",10.3389/fphar.2022.1058070,Frontiers In Pharmacology
Predisposing Factors In The Formation Of Biofilms In Indwelling Biliary Stents,"Introduction: Biliary plastic stents are a landmark achievement in the field of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the relief of obstructed biliary system by a non-surgical approach. The limiting factors for these plastic stents are their diameter and the tendency to get occluded. Factors involved in the formation of biofilms are not well studied. Objectives: We quantified the biofilm mass and its principal constituents in biliary stents, investigated the bacteria in biofilm formation and analyzed its relation to the predisposing factors. Methods: Demographic and clinical details of 81 patients with biliary stent retrieval were noted. Stents were processed for biofilm mass quantification, protein and polysaccharide estimation and molecular identification of bacteria involved. Correlation of biofilm formation to predisposing factors was also analyzed. Results: The underlying causes for stent insertion were benign stricture (35.8%), bile duct stones (56.8%) and malignancy (7.4%) with cholangitis in 61.7% patients. The retrieved stent size was 7 Fr (76.5%) and 10 Fr (23.5%) with 65 days median insertion duration. Polybacterial consortia were isolated in 82.5% of the stents. The mean biofilm mass was 0.187 ± 0.18 OD, protein 0.50 ± 0.25 mg/mL and polysaccharide 0.051 ± 0.018 mg/mL and were higher in stents of patients with cholangitis. Protein was significantly lower in the 10 Fr stents compared to 7 Fr ones. Biofilm mass was higher (p = 0.04) in stents with indwelling time of ≥3 months and >6 months. Factors such as etiology of stenting and presence of single versus multiple microorganisms were insignificant. Conclusion: Our study quantified biofilm mass, protein and polysaccharide in occluded biliary stents and demonstrated polybacterial profile. Cholangitis and smaller diameter stents depicted higher protein concentration in the biofilms predisposing to early biofilm formation. Longer stent indwelling time was associated with higher biofilm mass and protein concentration elucidating the timedependent biofilm formation process.","Vaishnavi C., Samanta J., Kapoor P., Kochhar R.",10.1186/s13756-017-0201-4,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Factors Influencing The Durability Of Antimicrobial Coatings On Different Surfaces,"Introduction: Infection through contaminated surfaces is not an abstract risk, but has already been shown by several publications. It has been shown that antimicrobial surfaces can significantly reduce microbiological contamination on surfaces in the long term. However, there have been few studies on how surface properties and reprocessing affect the durability of these coatings. Objectives: This work will therefore examine the influence of different materials and reprocessing methods on the durability of antimicrobial surface technologies. Methods: Test samples made of different materials (glass, plastic) are subsequently provided with an TiO2Ag based antimicrobial coating (HECOSOL GmbH, Bamberg) by electrospray technique and tested for their durability and remaining activity by standard methods (ISO 22196). In a second step, abrasion tests and microbiological activity tests were done on coated wallpaper bonded to plasterboard using various cleaning and disinfecting agents and cloth systems (microfiber cloth, cotton cloth, foam cloth). Results: While strong antimicrobial efficacy can still be demonstrated on glass surfaces even after several hundred abrasion cycles, this is no longer present on plastic surfaces after just a few cycles. The abrasion tests with various cleaning agents, disinfectants and wipe systems also showed an influence of the material and the preparation on the antimicrobial efficacy. All test samples in our experimental setup showed at least slight efficacy. However, only 5 of the 47 tested samples showed a remaining strong efficacy. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the underlying surface material and also the selection of cleaning and disinfection procedures and wipe systems appears to influence the durability of the coatings on the surfaces. In order to be able to make a statement about the longterm activity of these surface technologies, the effectiveness should be tested in the finished product and after several reprocessing cycles.","Buhl S., Stich A., Vogt J., Brückner R., Bulitta C.",10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
An Overview About The Medical Use Of Antifungals In Portugal In The Last Years,"Despite the introduction of new antifungal agents, the frequency of invasive and mucocutaneous fungal infections as well as resistance to antifungal drugs continues to increase. Over 300 million persons are infected annually with fungi. Resistance to antimicrobials is one of today's major health threats. Can the possible causes of fungal antimicrobial resistance be understood and prevented to minimize risks to public health. We provide an overview of antifungal drug use in European countries, particularly Portugal. We reviewed prescriptions for and over-the-counter sales (OTC) of azoles in Portuguese pharmacies and in alternative shops. We conclude that in Portugal, azole antifungal sales, as well as medical prescribed azoles are very high. The Portuguese population consumes more antifungal drugs per capita than others in Europe.","Manuel Da S Azevedo M., Cruz L., Pina-Vaz C., Gonçalves-Rodrigues A.",10.1057/jphp.2016.4,Journal Of Public Health Policy
Evolution Of Ph-Sensitive Transcription Termination During Adaptation To Repeated Long-Term Starvation.,"Fluctuating environments that consist of regular cycles of co-occurring stress are a common challenge faced by cellular populations. For a population to thrive in constantly changing conditions, an ability to coordinate a rapid cellular response is essential. Here, we identify a mutation conferring an arginine-to-histidine (Arg to His) substitution in the transcription terminator Rho. The rho R109H mutation frequently arose in E. coli populations experimentally evolved under repeated long-term starvation conditions, during which feast and famine result in drastic environmental pH fluctuations. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that populations containing the rho mutation also possess putative loss-of-function mutations in ydcI, which encodes a recently characterized transcription factor associated with pH homeostasis. Genetic reconstructions of these mutations show that the rho allele confers a plastic alkaline-induced reduction of Rho function that, when found in tandem with a ΔydcI allele, leads to intracellular alkalinization and genetic assimilation of Rho mutant function. We further identify Arg to His substitutions at analogous sites in rho alleles from species originating from fluctuating alkaline environments. Our results suggest that Arg to His substitutions in global regulators of gene expression can serve to rapidly coordinate complex responses through pH sensing and shed light on how cellular populations across the tree of life use environmental cues to coordinate rapid responses to complex, fluctuating environments.","Worthan S.B., Mccarthy R.D.P., Delaleau M., Stikeleather R., Bratton B.P., Boudvillain M., Behringer M.G.",10.1101/2024.03.01.582989,Biorxiv
Successful Topical Treatment Of Human Biofilms Using Multiple Antibiotic Elution From A Collagen-Rich Hydrogel,"Chronic non-healing wounds significantly strain modern healthcare systems, affecting 1-2% of the population in developed countries with costs ranging between $28.1 and $96.8 billion annually. Additionally, it has been established that chronic wounds resulting from comorbidities, such as peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, tend to be polymicrobial in nature. Treatment of polymicrobial chronic wounds with oral and IV antibiotics can result in antimicrobial resistance, leading to more difficult-to-treat wounds. Ideally, chronic ulcers would be topically treated with antibiotic combinations tailored to the microbiome of a patient's wound. We have previously shown that a topical collagen-rich hydrogel (cHG) can elute single antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth in a manner that is nontoxic to mammalian cells. Here, we analyzed the microbiology of cultures taken from human patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus suffering from chronic wounds present for more than 6 weeks. Additionally, we examined the safety of the elution of multiple antibiotics from collagen-rich hydrogel in mammalian cells in vivo. Finally, we aimed to create tailored combinations of antibiotics impregnated into cHG to successfully target and treat infections and eradicate biofilms cultured from human chronic diabetic wound tissue. We found that the majority of human chronic wounds in our study were polymicrobial in nature. The elution of multiple antibiotics from cHG was well-tolerated in mammalian cells, making it a potential topical treatment of the polymicrobial chronic wound. Finally, combinations of antibiotics tailored to each patient's microbiome eluted from a collagen-rich hydrogel successfully treated bacterial cultures isolated from patient samples via an in vitro assay.","Sharma A.D., Jarman E.H., Kuppalli K., Murphy M.J., Longaker M.T., Gurtner G., Fox P.M.",10.1038/s41598-024-54477-z,Scientific Reports
Quantification Of Dermal Microcirculatory Changes After Topical Administration Of Capsaicin: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study In 46 Subjects,"Background: Dermal blood flow is crucial for wound healing and survival of flaps in dermatologic surgery. To improve flap viability in cases of compromised perfusion topical agents can easily be applied. The aim of this placebo-controlled study was to characterize changes of DBF in healthy subjects by quantitatively assessing perfusion dynamics after application of capsaicin to establish a reference for measurements at injured sites. Methods: In 46 healthy subjects perfusion dynamics after local application with capsaicin and placebo was noninvasively assessed, determining cutaneous oxygen saturation, relative hemoglobin count and blood flow using an Oxygen-to-See device. Results: A significant raise in superficial (162% p = 0.000) and deep (144%, p = 0.000) skin oxygenation after 30 min was provoked. A highly significant raise in measurements of flow and velocity was present in superficial (523%, p = 0.000) and deep (242%, p = 0.000) sites. Conclusion: With the introduced model applied to observe changes in parameters of dermal blood flow in healthy subjects the authors can reliably monitor effects of topically administered capsaicin. This baseline can be used as reference for further studies in the settings of endangered flap survival or critically perfused wounds as has been proven in animal studies.","Schäfer R.C., Sohn A., Kersten A., Amr A., Held M., Wenger A.",10.1080/08941939.2022.2091694,Journal Of Investigative Surgery
Anatomic And High-Resolution Computed Tomographic Angiography Study Of The Lateral Femoral Condyle Flap: Implications For Surgical Dissection,"Background The lateral femoral condyle (LFC) flap is a vascularized bone flap based on the superior lateral genicular artery (SLGA). Harvest technique for this flap has not yet been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to better delineate the blood supply to the bone and skin of this flap to allow for a safe and effective harvest. Materials and methods Twenty-three lower extremities were injected with latex or a mixture of latex and barium sulfate. The SLGA was identified and dissected, documenting the course, diameter, anatomical relations, length, and branches. In the mixture group, high-resolution CT scanning was performed prior to dissection. Two additional specimens were dissected to illustrate the harvest technique. Results The SLGA originated from the popliteal artery at an average of 44.3 mm proximal to the knee joint line. The SLGA had an average diameter of 1.9 mm at origin and length of 56 mm. It coursed posterior to the femur, reaching the lateral intermuscular septum (IMS), dividing into superficial (patellar) and deep (condylar) branches, which coursed toward and gave branches to the patella and the LFC, respectively. At least one (average 1.4) septocutaneous skin perforator >5 mm emerged and ran posterior to the IMS. 3D reconstructions of the CT scans were used to confirm anatomic findings and describe a standard harvest technique. Conclusions The SLGA has consistent anatomy, adequate length, suitable diameter at origin for microvascular anastomosis, and constant perforators to bone and skin. The LFC flap provides a useful alternative to flaps from the medial knee or iliac crest.","Morsy M., Sur Y.J., Akdag O., Eisa A., El-Gammal T.A., Lachman N., Moran S.L.",10.1016/j.bjps.2017.08.012,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
The Arc Gene: Retroviral Heritage In Cognitive Functions,"Stabilization of neuronal plastic changes is mediated by transient gene expression, including transcription of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated gene (Arc), also known as Arg 3.1. Arc is implicated in several types of synaptic plasticity, including synaptic scaling, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression. However, the precise mechanisms by which Arc mediates these forms of long-term plasticity are unclear. It was recently found that Arc protein is capable of forming capsid-like structures and of transferring its own mRNA to neighboring cells. Moreover, Arc mRNA undergoes activity-dependent translation in these “transfected” cells. These new data raise unexpected possibilities for the mechanisms of the Arc action, and many intriguing questions concerning the role of Arc transcellular traffic in neuronal plasticity. In this mini-review, we discuss a possible link between the role of Arc in learning and memory and the virus-like properties of this protein. Additionally, we highlight some of the emerging questions for future neurobiological studies and translational applications of Arc transsynaptic effects.","Kedrov A.V., Durymanov M., Anokhin K.V.",10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.02.006,Neuroscience And Biobehavioral Reviews
Inferior Long-Term Results Of A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Initially Demonstrating Enhanced Sensory Nerve Recovery Using A Chitosan Nerve Tube,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic peripheral nerve injuries can result in significant functional impairments and long-term sequelae. This study evaluated the long-term outcomes of a chitosan tube implantation protecting the epineural coaptation after peripheral nerve injuries using two different tube versions (V 1.0 and V 2.0 with different wall thickness and resorption characteristics) compared to a control group. The study focused on pain levels, sensory function, and overall functional outcomes. METHODS: Patients who received tube implantation around direct coaptation sites of digital nerves were prospectively randomized and compared to control patients without additional tube protection. Pain levels, sensory function, grip force, and functional scores were assessed at different time points, ranging from three months to five years after the procedure. Furthermore, biodegradation of the tubes was measured via high-resolution MR-neurography (MRN) and categorized. RESULTS: Long-term evaluation revealed that patients with V 1.0 had higher pain levels compared to the control group after five years. They also reported more symptoms of numbness and hypersensitivity. V 2.0 patients exhibited higher pain levels at three months, which did not persist at six months. However, they showed compromised sensory function, with higher values of two-point discrimination compared to V 1.0 and the control group. No differences were found in grip force or functional scores between the groups. MRI displayed remnants of implants even in long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest potential limitations due to pain increase and impaired sensory function associated with tube implantation in the long term. However, in the short term, the material seemed to have a protective effect (as published previously). The resorption process was not completed at the end of the observation period of five years. This might explain the prolonged scarring and inferior long-term results. Future research should focus on improving tube materials and design to minimize adverse effects and enhance functional outcomes in patients with peripheral nerve injuries.","Aman M., Preisner F., Mayrhofer-Schmid M., Eisa A., Schwarz D., Kneser U., Harhaus L., Boecker A.H.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000011526,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Occurrence Characteristics Of Microplastics And Metal Elements In The Surface Water Of Huangpu River And Their Associations With Metal Resistance Genes,"Urban rivers have been regarded as the ""hotspots"" for microplastic (MPs) and metal contamination as they play important roles in pollution migration. However, as important sinks and sources of resistance genes, there has been little to no research investigating the associations between MPs, metal contaminations, and metal resistance genes (MRGs). Ten water samples were collected from the Huangpu River in situ; along with metal elements, MPs characteristics analyzed. Metal resistance genes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in waters and MPs were detected using metagenomic technology. As a result, the highest metal concentration was that of Sb in surface water (3.16±0.419) μg·L-1. The average abundance of MPs was (1.78±0.84) n·L-1, and the peak levels located in industrial and densely populated areas, which was significantly higher than those in agricultural and low population density areas. Fibrous, small-size (<0.5 mm), and transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the largest contributors of MPs. Eighteen MRGs were detected in all the samples. The relative abundance of MRGs in water was 1.68±0.21. The most dominant MRGs subtypes were merR and ruvB, which are subtypes resistant to mercury and Multi_metals. Correlation analysis showed that chromium and nickel in waters were significantly positively associated with MRG-Cr, MRG-Ni, and Multi_metals resistance genes. For MPs particles, the relative abundance of MRGs was 1.63±0.53. The most dominant MRGs subtypes were merT-P and copB, which also belong to mercury-resistant and Multi_metals. The Multi_metals resistance gene, ctpC, cueA, czrA, kmtR, etc., had significant positive associations with Ni, Cr, and Sb in waters. Compared with water samples, MPs selectively enriched merT-P, copB, ziaA, sodA, and dmeF. Additionally, the co-occurrence patterns of MRGs and MGEs were explored based on network analysis. In water samples, the transposases (tnpA_1 and tnpA_2), integrase (qacEdelta), and insertion sequence (IS91) were the major contributors of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of specific MRGs. Multiple subtypes resistant to copper and Multi_metals resistance genes on MPs were positively associated with IncFIC(FII), Rep7, rep7, and rep13, which were subtypes of plasmids. The presence of MPs exerted a significant impact on HGT of specific MRGs mediated by plasmids.","Lu J.-W., Xu C.-Y., Hu C., Liu S.-R., Li F.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202206267,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Pediatric Acute Dacryocystitis,"Purpose: To review and summarize the symptomatology, microbiology, special clinical entities, management, complications, and outcomes of pediatric acute dacryocystitis. Methods: The author performed a PubMed search of all articles published in English on acute dacryocystitis. Pediatric subpopulations of these articles were reviewed along with the scant literature of direct references to neonatal and pediatric acute dacryocystitis. Data reviewed included demographics, presentations, microbiological work up, management, complications, and outcomes. Results: Acute dacryocystitis is not very common in the pediatric age groups and occurs mostly as a complication of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The age of onset is usually in the neonatal period with a female preponderance. The clinical spectrum ranges from classic pediatric acute dacryocystitis to meningitis. Staphylococcus aureus is the commonest isolate. Occasionally acquired etiologies and rare organisms like Pantoea sp., Epstein-Barr Virus, and Sporothrix are implicated in the etiopathogenesis. The diagnosis is usually clinical aided by laboratory investigations. Better antibiotics, well-established laboratory techniques and surgical modalities, and improved patient care logistics have contributed to good outcomes; however, complications are still being noted although infrequently. Conclusions: Pediatric acute dacryocystitis is a distinct entity with unique features of its own. It is a serious infection that warrants careful evaluation and immediate management. In the era of antibiotic resistance, microbiological work up of Pediatric acute dacryocystitis is very useful for subsequent treatment. Surgical challenges in the pediatric age group are distinct and the outcomes are good if standard protocols are followed.",Ali M.J.,10.1097/IOP.0000000000000472,Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Polyethylene Microplastics Increase Cadmium Uptake In Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa L.) By Altering The Soil Microenvironment,"Little research has focused on the combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals in soil, especially the mechanism of their interaction. We conducted a 45-day microcosm experiment to test the hypothesis that polyethylene (PE) MPs and cadmium (Cd) had a joint toxicity to lettuce fitness. The effects of MPs at different addition ratios on Cd bioavailability and soil properties were also investigated in the microenvironment of three levels of Cd-contaminated soils. The results showed that the 10% MPs had an adverse impact on the plant biomass and significantly decreased soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC), but significantly increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The presence of MPs increased the soil Cd bioavailability and plant Cd concentrations and accumulations across all three levels of Cd-contaminated soils, which potentially aggregated the combined toxicity. The amounts of the bacterial 16SRNA and the fungal ITSRNA genes displayed a hormesis effect in response to the MP addition ratios while the abundance of Cd resistance genes cadA and czcA increased across all three Cd levels. The regression path analysis indicated that MPs affected shoot Cd concentrations by altering soil properties, which directly and indirectly contributed to the alteration mechanism, while the soil pH, DOC, and Cd bioavailability played core roles. The results suggest that the co-exposure of PE MPs in heavy metal-contaminated soil may therefore increase the toxicity, uptake, accumulation, and bioavailability of heavy metals by altering the properties of the soil microenvironment, which deserves further research.","Wang F., Wang X., Song N.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147133,Science Of The Total Environment
Intraoperative Bile Culture In Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Teaching Old Dogma New Tricks,"INTRODUCTION: Biliary stents increase surgical site infections (SSIs) following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to bactibilia and contaminated intraoperative bile spillage. Intraoperative bile culture (IOBC) is performed to guide empiric therapy for SSIs; however, its utility is poorly studied. We sought to evaluate IOBC and the interplay between stenting, bactibilia, and SSI following pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS: Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 2008 to April 2020 were identified through our institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database; patients without IOBC were excluded. Odds of SSI were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Four-hundred-eighty-three patients were identified. One-hundred-eighty-nine (39%) patients had plastic stents and 154 (32%) had metal stents. Three-hundred-twenty-nine (96%) patients with stents had bactibilia versus 18 (13%) without stents (P < 0.001). The biliary microbiome and antibiotic resistance patterns in patients with metal and plastic stents were nearly identical. Of 159 NSQIP-defined SSIs, most were incisional (n = 92, 58%). Bactibilia and stent presence were associated with incisional (OR 3.69 and 3.39, both P < 0.001) but not organ space SSI (P > 0.1); however, stent type was not (P > 0.5). Of the 73 speciated SSI cultures, an IOBC-identified organism was present in 42 (58%), while at least one organism not found in the IOBC was present in 49 (67%). CONCLUSION: Bactibilia is associated with incisional but not organ space SSI following pancreaticoduodenectomy and is strongly associated with stent presence. Stent type does not independently influence the biliary microbiome or SSI risk. IOBC has a poor ability to predict causative organisms in SSIs following pancreaticoduodenectomy and is not recommended for routine use.","Sutton T.L., O'Grady J., Martindale R., Mayo S.C., Gilbert E.W., Sheppard B.C.",10.1007/s11605-021-05182-z,Journal Of Gastrointestinal Surgery : Official Journal Of The Society For Surgery Of The Alimentary Tract
"The Chlamydia Suis Genome Exhibits High Levels Of Diversity, Plasticity, And Mobile Antibiotic Resistance: Comparative Genomics Of A Recent Livestock Cohort Shows Influence Of Treatment Regimes","Chlamydia suis is an endemic pig pathogen, belonging to a fascinating genus of obligate intracellular pathogens. Of particular interest, this is the only chlamydial species to have naturally acquired genes encoding for tetracycline resistance. To date, the distribution and mobility of the Tet-island are not well understood. Our study focused on whole genome sequencing of 29 C. suis isolates from a recent porcine cohort within Switzerland, combined with data from USA tetracycline-resistant isolates. Our findings show that the genome of C. suis is very plastic, with unprecedented diversity, highly affected by recombination and plasmid exchange. A large diversity of isolates circulates within Europe, even within individual Swiss farms, suggesting that C. suis originated around Europe. New World isolates have more restricted diversity and appear to derive from European isolates, indicating that historical strain transfers to the United States have occurred. The architecture of the Tet-island is variable, but the tetA(C) gene is always intact, and recombination has been a major factor in its transmission within C. suis. Selective pressure from tetracycline use within pigs leads to a higher number of Tet-island carrying isolates, which appear to be lost in the absence of such pressure, whereas the loss or gain of the Tet-island from individual strains is not observed. The Tet-island appears to be a recent import into the genome of C. suis, with a possible American origin.","Seth-Smith H.M., Wanninger S., Bachmann N., Marti H., Qi W., Donati M., Di Francesco A., Polkinghorne A., Borel N.",10.1093/gbe/evx043,Genome Biology And Evolution
Efficacy And Safety Of Ala-Pdt In Treatment Of Diabetic Foot Ulcer With Infection,"Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with infection is a major clinical issue, as the infection not only potentially devastate the wound healing, but also is the factor that most often leads to amputation. Nevertheless, traditional antibiotic treatment is often insufficient to clear the infection, which could lead to side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has broad-spectral antibacterial activity. Meanwhile, it is difficult to induce antibiotic resistance. Here, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) in the treatment of DFUs with infection. Methods: In our study, 5 diabetic patients with infectious DFUs were diagnosed by pathological examination and the depth of wound was examined by X-Ray. All patients’ wounds were firstly irradiated with 20% ALA-PDT (635 nm, 100 J/cm(2), 80 mW/cm(2)) using the red LED to control the infection. Treatment will be combined with debridement if there is granulation necrosis or secretion on the wound surface. PDT sessions were performed weekly in all patients until healing was achieved. All patients were followed up for 0.6–1.2 years after treatment. Results: In 5 patients, the DFUs with infection was completely controlled by ALA-PDT. There was no recurrence of DFUs in the follow-up of 0.9 years (range, 0.6–1.2 years) after the treatment. Conclusions: ALA-PDT treatment for DFUs with infection show successful outcomes and might ultimately avoid amputation.","Li X., Kou H., Zhao C., Zhu F., Yang Y., Lu Y.",10.1016/j.pdpdt.2022.102822,Photodiagnosis And Photodynamic Therapy
Systemic Antibiotics In The Surgical Treatment Of Peri-Implantitis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial,"Aim: To study the clinical, radiographic and microbiological outcomes after surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, with or without adjunctive systemic antibiotics. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four patients (113 implants) with peri-implantitis were randomized into three groups (A, amoxicillin and metronidazole; B, phenoxymethylpenicillin and metronidazole; or C, placebo). Treatment included resective surgery and implant surface decontamination with adjunctive antibiotics or placebo. Primary outcomes were probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction and marginal bone level (MBL) stability. Secondary outcomes were treatment success (defined as PPD ≤ 5 mm, bleeding on probing [BOP] ≤ 1site, absence of suppuration on probing [SOP] and absence of progressive bone loss of >0.5 mm), changes in BOP/SOP, mucosal recession (REC), clinical attachment level (CAL), bacterial levels and adverse events. Outcomes were evaluated for up to 12 months. The impact of potential prognostic indicators on treatment success was evaluated using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 76 patients (104 implants) completed the study. All groups showed clinical and radiological improvements over time. Statistically significant differences were observed between groups for MBL stability (A = 97%, B = 89%, C = 76%), treatment success (A = 68%, B = 66%, C = 28%) and bacterial levels of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia, favouring antibiotics compared to placebo. Multiple regression identified antibiotic use as potential prognostic indicator for treatment success. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most reported adverse events in the antibiotic groups. Conclusions: Adjunctive systemic antibiotics resulted in additional improvements in MBL stability. However, the potential clinical benefits of antibiotics need to be carefully balanced against the risk of adverse events and possible antibiotic resistance.","Riben Grundström C., Lund B., Kämpe J., Belibasakis G.N., Hultin M.",10.1111/jcpe.13994,Journal Of Clinical Periodontology
Analysis Of Blood Cultures From Major Burns Patients In A Tertiary Care Burn Unit In Oman,"Objectives: This study aimed to review the blood stream infections of major burn patients in a tertiary care burn unit to determine the most prevalent infecting organisms in order to have a better empirical therapy protocol. Methods: This retrospective study analysed the blood stream infection of 155 major burn (>20% Total Body Surface Area [TBSA]) patients in Khoula Hospital, Muscat, Oman between January 2014 to December 2019. Results: The median age was 33 years and 57.42% of patients were male. The median TBSA was 38%, mortality was 25.16% and 50.9% of patients had positive blood cultures. The expired patients had higher TBSAs, Abbreviated Burns Severity Index scores and earlier first positive blood cultures. Candida was commonly grown in all the blood cultures, but the most prevalent organisms were Acinetobacter, Staphylococci, Klebsiella, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas. All Acinetobacter species are multidrug resistant. Of the 17 patients who had Kelbsiella grown in the blood culture, 8 grew multidrug-resistant Klebsiella. Only 4 patients' blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The number of blood culture samples taken ranged between 1-28 (median = 6). The first positive blood culture showed that Staphylococcus epidermidis and Acinetobacter were the most common infecting organisms. Conclusions: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter was the most predominant microorganism grown from the blood cultures of major burn patients in a tertiary care burn unit. Empirical therapy should include antibiotics that are effective against this organism to reduce the mortality.","Albusaidi M.T., Jabri A.A., Hadhrami A.A.A., Al Khaldi M.O., Shummo M.A., Haridi K.M., Din A.S.E., Ghawas S.M., Saleh A.E., Jacob J., Alsafy T., Elias A.T., Al-Busaidi S.",10.18295/squmj.12.2023.085,Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal
"Colistin Resistance In Gram-Negative Ocular Infections: Prevalence, Clinical Outcome And Antibiotic Susceptibility Patterns","Purpose: To study the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility profile, clinical outcomes and plasmid-mediated transfer of colistin resistance (CLR) among Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolates from different ocular infections. Design: Prospective case–control study in eastern India. Methods: Consecutive ocular samples with GNB isolates from clinically diagnosed cases of microbial keratitis, infectious endophthalmitis and orbital infections were included. Inclusion criteria were significant GNB growth from ocular samples and > 6 weeks follow-up. Clinical outcomes were determined by disease-specific criteria for each clinical group. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution for colistin and Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method for others. Plasmid detection for CLR genes mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes was done by standard protocols. Results: Sixty GNB isolates were studied. Overall prevalence of CLR (intrinsic plus acquired) was 40% (n = 24), acquired being 37.5% of CLR isolates (n = 9). The prevalence varied from 45.5% (10/22) and 45% (9/20) in microbial keratitis and infectious endophthalmitis, respectively, to 26.3% (5/19) in orbital infections. Clinical outcomes in CLR patients were significantly worse in microbial keratitis (p = 0.018) and orbital infections (p = 0.018), and comparable to colistin-susceptible ones (p = 0.77) in infectious endophthalmitis. CLR isolates had significantly higher resistance to Amikacin, Gentamicin and Ceftazidime but were susceptible to Piperacillin, Carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Plasmids mcr-1 and mcr-2 were detected in 6.25% (n = 1) and 25%(n = 4), respectively, of the 16 tested isolates. Conclusions: CLR is highly prevalent in ocular isolates and affects clinical outcomes. CLR isolates may still remain susceptible to Carbapenems, Piperacillin and fluoroquinolones. Plasmid mcr-1- and mcr-2-mediated CLR remains low in ocular infections.","Mitra S., Basu S., Rath S., Sahu S.K.",10.1007/s10792-020-01298-4,International Ophthalmology
Reliability Of Chest Wall Perforator Flaps For Breast Reshaping Following Massive Weight Loss,"BACKGROUND: Breast deformity following massive weight loss poses a unique challenge inadequately managed by traditional methods. Patients also have considerable lateral and posterior upper trunk tissue surplus. Multiple studies have used chest wall flaps for auto-augmentation with mastopexy to tackle this problem. However, the outcome measures did not include any objective tools to assess the reliability of these flaps. Hence, in this study sono-mammography and breast anthropometric measurements are used for evaluation of the added volume and long-term sustainability of chest wall perforator flaps. METHODOLOGY: Twenty massive weight loss patients with Pittsburgh Rating Scale score 2-3 underwent mastopexy with autologous augmentation through perforator flaps encompassing lateral chest wall skin. Outcome measures were breast volume, and the presence of fat necrosis on mammography, and direct breast anthropometry. CONCLUSION: All patients showed a consistent increase in volume postoperatively and no fat necrosis in postoperative mammography, reflecting flap reliability over one year of follow-up. All postoperative anthropometric measurements showed improvement in the breast deformities addressed.

Tellurium Compound Provides Pro-Apoptotic Signaling In Drug Resistant Multiple Myeloma,"Multiple Myeloma, effectively treated by chemotherapeutic drugs, relapses due to drug resistance. We tested here the capacity of mesenchymal stromal cells, from the bone marrow of patients or from adipose tissue of healthy individuals, to induce drug resistance in Myeloma cell lines. We show that drug resistance can be achieved by factors secreted by the various MSC’s. Mass spectrometry analysis of MSC’s conditioned media revealed that fibronectin, was particularly instrumental in providing anti-apoptotic signals to MM cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that SAS ([octa-O-bis-(R,R)tartarate ditellurane]), an immunomodulator Tellurium compound, is not only able of blocking the physical interaction between MM cells and fibronectin but is also capable of re-sensitizing the cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, we show that this re-sensitization is coupled with the blocking of pAKT induction, in MM cells, by the MSC’s. These results indicate that SAS may be useful in the treatment of drug resistant MM.","Zigman-Hoffman E., Sredni B., Meilik B., Naparstek E., Tartakovsky B.",10.1080/10428194.2020.1858292,Leukemia And Lymphoma
"Environmental Pitfalls And Associated Human Health Risks And Ecological Impacts From Landfill Leachate Contaminants: Current Evidence, Recommended Interventions And Future Directions","The improper management of solid waste, particularly the dumping of untreated municipal solid waste, poses a growing global challenge in both developed and developing nations. The generation of leachate is one of the significant issues that arise from this practice, and it can have harmful impacts on both the environment and public health. This paper presents an overview of the primary waste types that generate landfill leachate and their characteristics. This includes examining the distribution of waste types in landfills globally and how they have changed over time, which can provide valuable insights into potential pollutants in a given area and their trends. With a lack of specific regulations and growing concerns regarding environmental and health impacts, the paper also focuses on emerging contaminants. Furthermore, the environmental and ecological impacts of leachate, along with associated health risks, are analyzed. The potential applications of landfill leachate, suggested interventions and future directions are also discussed in the manuscript. Finally, this work addresses future research directions in landfill leachate studies, with attention, for the first time to the potentialities that artificial intelligence can offer for landfill leachate management, studies, and applications.","Gunarathne V., Phillips A.J., Zanoletti A., Rajapaksha A.U., Vithanage M., Di Maria F., Pivato A., Korzeniewska E., Bontempi E.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169026,Science Of The Total Environment
Decontaminating Surfaces With Atomized Disinfectants Generated By A Novel Thickness-Mode Lithium Niobate Device,"We evaluated the ability of a novel lithium niobate (LN) thickness-mode device to atomize disinfectants and reduce microbial burden on model surface materials. A small-scale plastic model housed the LN thickness-mode device and circular coupon surface materials including polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and natural rubber. Coupon surfaces were coated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii), atomized with disinfectant solutions of varying viscosity (including 10% bleach, 70% ethanol (EtOH), or 25% triethylene glycol (TEG)) using the LN thickness-mode device, and assessed for surviving bacteria. The LN thickness-mode device effectively atomized disinfectants ranging from low viscosity 10% bleach solution or 70% EtOH to highly viscous 25% TEG. Coupons harboring MDR bacteria and atomized with 10% bleach solution or 70% EtOH were effectively decontaminated with ~ 100% bacterial elimination. Atomized 25% TEG effectively eliminated 100% of K. pneumoniae (CRE) from contaminated coupon surfaces but not MRSA. The enclosed small-scale plastic model established proof-of-principle that the LN thickness-mode device could atomize disinfectants of varying viscosities and decontaminate coupon surface materials harboring MDR organisms. Future studies evaluating scaled devices for patient rooms are warranted to determine their utility in hospital environmental decontamination.","Kumaraswamy M., Collignon S., Do C., Kim J., Nizet V., Friend J.",10.1007/s00253-018-9088-0,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology

Genome Plasticity Shapes The Ecology And Evolution Of Phocaeicola Dorei And Phocaeicola Vulgatus,"Phocaeicola dorei and Phocaeicola vulgatus are very common and abundant members of the human gut microbiome and play an important role in the infant gut microbiome. These species are closely related and often confused for one another; yet, their genome comparison, interspecific diversity, and evolutionary relationships have not been studied in detail so far. Here, we perform phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic analyses of these two Phocaeicola species. We report that P. dorei has a larger genome yet a smaller pan-genome than P. vulgatus. We found that this is likely because P. vulgatus is more plastic than P. dorei, with a larger repertoire of genetic mobile elements and fewer anti-phage defense systems. We also found that P. dorei directly descends from a clade of P. vulgatus¸ and experienced genome expansion through genetic drift and horizontal gene transfer. Overall, P. dorei and P. vulgatus have very different functional and carbohydrate utilisation profiles, hinting at different ecological strategies, yet they present similar antimicrobial resistance profiles.","Da Silva Morais E., Grimaud G.M., Warda A., Stanton C., Ross P.",10.1038/s41598-024-59148-7,Scientific Reports
Azole-Resistant Aspergillus Fumigatus Clinical Isolate Screening In Azole-Containing Agar Plates (Eucast E.Def 10.1): Low Impact Of Plastic Trays Used And Poor Performance In Cryptic Species,"Azole-containing agar is used in routine Aspergillus fumigatus azole resistance screening. We evaluated the impact of the type of plastic used to prepare in-house agar plates on the procedure's performance against A. fumigatus sensu stricto and cryptic species. A. fumigatus sensu stricto (n = 91) and cryptic species (n = 52) were classified as susceptible or resistant (EUCAST E.Def 9.3.2; clinical breakpoints v10). In-house azole-containing agar plates were prepared following EUCAST E.Def 10.1 on three types of multidish plates. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and agreement values of the agar plates to screen for azole resistance. Overall, sensitivity and specificity values of the agar screening method were 100% and 93.3%, respectively. The type of tray used did not affect these values. All isolates harboring TR34-L98H substitutions were classified as resistant to itraconazole and voriconazole by the agar method; however, false susceptibility (very major error) to posaconazole was not uncommon and happened in isolates with posaconazole MICs of 0.25 mg/liter. Isolates harboring G54R and TR46-Y121F-T289A substitutions were correctly classified by the agar method as itraconazole/posaconazole resistant and voriconazole resistant, respectively. False resistance (major error) occurred in isolates showing tiny fungal growth. Finally, agreements between both procedures against cryptic species were much lower. Azole-containing agar plates are a convenient and reliable tool to screen for resistance in A. fumigatus sensu stricto; the type of plastic tray used minimally affects the method. On the contrary, the performance against cryptic species is rather poor.","Serrano-Lobo J., Gómez A., Rodríguez-Sánchez B., Muñoz P., Escribano P., Guinea J.",10.1128/AAC.00482-21,Antimicrobial Agents And Chemotherapy

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Contamination Of Hospital-Use-Only Mobile Phones And Efficacy Of 222-Nm Ultraviolet Disinfection,"Background: Mobile phones may be contaminated with nosocomial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The aim of this study was to investigate the MRSA contamination rate on doctors’ hospital-use-only mobile phones and the efficacy of 222-nm ultraviolet light (UV) disinfection. Methods: We investigated the MRSA contamination rate of doctors’ hospital-use-only mobile phones, as well as the reduction in MRSA counts on plastic plates and aerobic bacteria (AB) on mobile phones before and after exposure to 222-nm UV irradiation. Results: Five (10%) of the 50 mobile phones investigated were contaminated with MRSA. Exposure to 0.1 mJ/cm(2) 222-nm UVC irradiation for 1.5 and 2.5 min (9 and 15 mJ/cm(2)) achieved mean log(10) MRSA colony-forming units reductions of 2.91 and 3.95, respectively. Exposure to 9 mJ/cm(2) 222-nm UVC irradiation (0.1 mW/cm(2) for 1.5 minutes) significantly reduced AB contamination on mobile phones (P <.001). Conclusions: The use of 222-nm UV disinfection resulted in effective in vitro reduction of MRSA and significantly reduced AB contamination of mobile phone surfaces.","Kaiki Y., Kitagawa H., Hara T., Nomura T., Omori K., Shigemoto N., Takahashi S., Ohge H.",10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.011,American Journal Of Infection Control
"Mycoplasma Agalactiae Vaccines: Current Status, Hurdles, And Opportunities Due To Advances In Pathogenicity Studies","Contagious agalactia (CA) is a serious multietiological disease whose classic etiological agent is Mycoplasma agalactiae and which causes high morbidity and mortality rates in infected herds. CA is classified as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health due to its significant worldwide economic impact on livestock, primarily involving goat and sheep farms. The emergence of atypical symptoms and strains of M. agalactiae in wildlife ungulates reestablishes its highly plastic genome and is also of great epidemiological significance. Antimicrobial therapy is the main form of control, although several factors, such as intrinsic antibiotic resistance and the selection of resistant strains, must be considered. Available vaccines are few and mostly inefficient. The virulence and pathogenicity mechanisms of M. agalactiae mainly rely on surface molecules that have direct contact with the host. Because of this, they are essential for the development of vaccines. This review highlights the currently available vaccines and their limitations and the development of new vaccine possibilities, especially considering the challenge of antigenic variation and dynamic genome in this microorganism.","Barbosa M.S., Sampaio B.A., Spergser J., Rosengarten R., Marques L.M., Chopra-Dewasthaly R.",10.3390/vaccines12020156,Vaccines
Clinical Indications And Compassionate Use Of Phage Therapy: Personal Experience And Literature Review With A Focus On Osteoarticular Infections,"The history of phage therapy started with its first clinical application in 1919 and continues its development to this day. Phages continue to lack any market approval in Western medicine as a recognized drug, but are increasingly used as an experimental therapy for the compassionate treatment of patients experiencing antibiotic failure. The few formal experimental phage clinical trials that have been completed to date have produced inconclusive results on the efficacy of phage therapy, which contradicts the many successful treatment outcomes observed in historical accounts and recent individual case reports. It would therefore be wise to identify why such a discordance exists between trials and compassionate use in order to better develop future phage treatment and clinical applications. The multitude of observations reported over the years in the literature constitutes an invaluable experience, and we add to this by presenting a number of cases of patients treated compassionately with phages throughout the past decade with a focus on osteoarticular infections. Additionally, an abundance of scientific literature into phage-related areas is transforming our knowledge base, creating a greater understanding that should be applied for future clinical applications. Due to the increasing number of treatment failures anticipatedfrom the perspective of a possible post-antibiotic era, we believe that the introduction of bacteriophages into the therapeutic arsenal seems a scientifically sound and eminently practicable consideration today as a substitute or adjuvant to antibiotic therapy.","Patey O., Mccallin S., Mazure H., Liddle M., Smithyman A., Dublanchet A.",10.3390/v11010018,Viruses
Chlorination Enhances The Phthalates Release And Increases The Cytotoxicity And Bacterial Functions Related To Human Disease Of Drinking Water In Plastic Pipes,"The interaction between water and pipe surfaces can deteriorate drinking water quality, thus threatening public health. However, uncertainties remain in the release mechanism of phthalates acid esters (PAEs) from plastic pipes and their effects on drinking water quality. Our study indicated that PAEs released from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes was higher than polyethylene (PE) pipes. Chlorine disinfection increased the released PAEs concentration in effluents of PE-Cl(2) and PVC–Cl(2) pipes to 6.60∼7.87 μg/L and 7.45∼8.88 μg/L, respectively. PAEs release varied the CHO and tannins numbers in dissolved organic matter (DOM), increasing the cytotoxicity of water. Although chorine disinfection reduced the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, it upregulated the relative abundance of bacterial metabolic pathways related to human disease, such as drug resistance: antimicrobial and cancer: overview. In addition, various biofilm bacterial community compositions affected the interactions between bacteria and pipe surfaces, and the roughness of pipe surfaces increased after biofilm formation. The hydrophilicity of pipe surfaces also increased due to biofilm formation and chlorine disinfection. After five months of running, higher hydrophilicity of PVC pipe surface was observed than that of PE pipes, especially after chlorine disinfection, consequently enhancing PAEs release. In conclusion, chlorine disinfection accelerated PAEs release from plastic pipes by increasing the hydrophilicity of pipe surfaces, resulting in higher cytotoxicity and microbial risk of drinking water, especially in PVC–Cl(2) pipes. This study revealed the influence of chlorine disinfection on PAEs release and its potential risk to public health, which provided insightful visions for the future drinking water security monitoring.","Wang H., Wang M., Li Y., Yang X., Xing X., Shi B.",10.1016/j.watres.2025.123218,Water Research
Nanoemulsion-Loaded Hydrogel Coatings For Inhibition Of Bacterial Virulence And Biofilm Formation On Solid Surfaces,"The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century for the researchers to combat and in turn search for novel targets which could lead to the development of effective and sustainable therapies. Inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence of bacterial pathogens is an emerging approach to address the challenges related to bacterial infections. To suppress the virulence and biofilm formation by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECOH), we developed stable nanoemulsion (NE) of Gaultheria fragrantissima Wall. essential oil's (EO) bioactive compounds, viz., eugenol (E-NE) and methyl salicylate (MS-NE) that showed significantly higher anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate without affecting ECOH planktonic cell growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that E-NE and MS-NE reduced the expression of genes, including curli, type I fimbriae, Shiga-like toxins, quorum sensing, and ler-controlled toxins, which are needed for biofilm formation, pathogenicity, and attachment. E-NE and MS-NE loaded hydrogel coatings showed superior anti-biofilm activity against ECOH on glass, plastic and meat surfaces as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate loaded coatings. Conclusively, NE-loaded hydrogel coatings could be used in combating ECOH infection on solid surfaces through anti-biofilm and anti-virulence strategies.","Prateeksha, Barik S.K., Singh B.N.",10.1038/s41598-019-43016-w,Scientific Reports
Effects Of Microplastics (Mps) And Tributyltin (Tbt) Alone And In Combination On Bile Acids And Gut Microbiota Crosstalk In Mice,"Microplastics (MPs) and tributyltin (TBT) are both potential environmental pollutants that enter organisms through the food chain and affect bodily functions. However, the effects and mechanisms of MPs and TBT exposure (especially the co-exposure of both pollutants) on mammals remain unclear. In this study, Ф5 μm MPs (5MP) was administered alone or in combination with TBT to investigate the health risk of oral exposure in mice. All three treatments induced inflammation in the liver, altered gut microbiota composition and disturbed fecal bile acids profiles. In addition to decreasing triglyceride (TG) and increasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and macrophage-expressed gene 1 (Mpeg1), 5MP induced hepatic cholestasis by stimulating the expression of the cholesterol hydroxylase enzymes CYP8B1 and CYP27A1, and inhibiting multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 3 (MRP2, MRP3), and bile-salt export pump (BSEP) to prevent bile acids for entering the blood and bile. Correspondingly, 5MP treatment decreased 7-ketolithocholic acid (7-ketoLCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA), which were positively correlated with decreased Bacteroides and Marvinbryantia and negatively correlated with increased Bifidobacterium. In addition, TBT increased interferon γ (IFNγ) and Mpeg1 levels to induce inflammation, accompanied by decreased 7-ketoLCA, tauro-alpha-muricholic acid (T-alpha-MCA) and alpha-muricholic acid (alpha-MCA) levels, which were negatively related to Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 and Bifidobacterium. Co-exposure to 5MP and TBT also decreased TG and induced bile acids accumulation in the liver due to inhibited BSEP, which might be attributed to the co-regulation of decreased T-alpha-MCA and Harryflintia. In conclusion, the administration of 5MP and TBT alone and in combination could cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and subsequently alter bile acids profiles, while the combined exposure of 5MP and TBT weakened the toxic effects of 5MP and TBT alone.","Jiang P., Yuan G.-H., Jiang B.-R., Zhang J.-Y., Wang Y.-Q., Lv H.-J., Zhang Z., Wu J.-L., Wu Q., Li L.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112345,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Engineering Nano Ag-Decorated Graphene Oxide/ Gelatin Methacryloyl Photothermal Platforms To Combat Bacterial Infection And Prompt Wound Healing,"INTRODUCTION: Infected wounds have become a common clinical problem. Due to the abuse of antibiotics, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has threatened public health, led to poor curative effects, and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to find new antimicrobial methods to treat drug-resistant bacteria. Nanoparticles are applied widely because of their broad-spectrum antibacterial ability. Ag nanoparticles have become promising antibacterial agents owing to their good biocompatibility, bioactivity, and immunomodulatory effects. However, the therapeutic effects of Ag nanoparticles are generally limited by their easy oxidization and inferior sustained-release effect. As an inorganic nanomaterial, graphene oxide (GO) is rich in functional groups, π-π bonds, and has good photothermal effect that confers itself to combined antimicrobial capacities. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is a commonly used material to construct hydrogels that has the characteristics of ultraviolet cross-linking, simulated extracellular matrix structure, and sustained release drugs. Consequently, we infer that it's possible to construct an excellent antibacterial material that contains Ag/GO nanoparticles encapsulated into a GelMA hydrogel network. METHODS: Silver ammonia solution was generated with silver nitrate and ammonia, then reduced to silver nanoparticles by glucose and modified on GO to construct GO/Ag nanoparticles, and finally encapsulated into CelMA hydrogel to obtain Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel. We evaluated the physicochemical, the rheological properties, photothermal effects, and antibacterial characterization. Then we constructed the rat infected wound model, and the healing effects were evaluated by gross photo and histological staining. RESULTS: Electron microscopy, FT-IR, XRD, TGA and rheological tests showed that the Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel was successfully constructed. The fabricated hydrogel exhibited good heating capacity under near-infrared irradiation, accelerated Ag releasing, and excellent antibacterial effects towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Cell experiments showed that the Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel had good biocompatibility with fibroblasts. The Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel exhibited excellent photothermal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo and accelerated wound repair when placed on the infected wound of rats. Histological staining of important organs showed that the Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel had no obvious biological toxicity. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully constructed an Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel, which has excellent mechanical, photothermal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. The incorporated GO possessed inherent photothermal effects and could adsorb Ag nanoparticles to reduce oxidation through π-π bonds. The adsorbed Ag nanoparticles could enhance the photothermal effects of GO by reducing nonradiative transition and promoting the dispersion of GO in GelMA hydrogel. Finally, the fabricated Ag-GO-GelMA hydrogel was able to accelerate the healing of infected wounds.","Sun Z., Hu K., Zhou C., Yang Y.",10.1089/ten.tea.2023.29043.abstracts,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Reduction Of Suture Associated Inflammation After 28 Days Using Novel Biocompatible Pseudoprotein Poly(Ester Amide) Biomaterials,"Sutures elicit an inflammatory response, which may impede the healing process and result in wound complications. We recently reported a novel family of biocompatible, biodegradable polymers, amino acid-based poly(ester amide)s (AA-PEA), which we have shown to significantly attenuate the foreign body inflammatory response in vitro. Two types of AA-PEA (Phe-PEA and Arg-Phe-PEA) were used to coat silk or plain-gut sutures, which were implanted in the gluteus muscle of C57BL/6 mice, while the uncoated control sutures were implanted in the contralateral side. After 3, 7, 14, and 28 days the mean area of inflammation surrounding the sutures was compared. Phe-PEA coating of silk sutures significantly decreased inflammation compared with noncoated controls (67.8 ± 17.4% after 3d [p = 0.0014], 51.6 ± 7.2% after 7d [p < 0.001], and 37.3 ± 8.3% after 28d [p = 0.0001]) when assessed via analysis of photomicrographs using digital image software. Phe-PEA coated plain-gut sutures were similarly assessed and demonstrated a significant decrease in the mean area of inflammation across all time points (54.1±8.3% after 3 d, 41.4 ± 3.9% after 7 d, 71.5 ± 8.1% after 14 d, 78.4 ± 8.5%, and after 28 d [all p < 0.0001]). Arg-Phe-PEA coated silk demonstrated significantly less inflammation compared to noncoated controls (61.3 ± 9.4% after 3 d, 44.7±4.7% after 7 d, 19.6 ± 8%, and 38.3 ± 6.8% after 28 d [all p < 0.0001]), as did coated plain-gut (37.4 ± 8.3% after 3 d [p = 0.0004], 55.0 ± 7.8% after 7 d [p < 0.0001], 46.0±4.6% after 14 d [p < 0.0001], and 59.0 ± 7.9% after 28 d [p < 0.0001]). Both Phe-PEA and Arg-Phe-PEA coatings significantly decrease the inflammatory response to sutures in vivo for up to 28 days.","Hernandez K.A., Hooper R.C., Boyko T., Golas A.R., Van Harten M., Wu D.Q., Weinstein A., Chu C.C., Spector J.A.",10.1002/jbm.b.33211,Journal Of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials
Endocrine Disruption: Structural Interactions Of Androgen Receptor Against Di(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate And Its Metabolites,"Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride plastics for household and commercial use. DEHP is a ubiquitous ecocontaminant and causes developmental and reproductive problems in children and adults. After exposure, DEHP is metabolized by endogenous hydrolysis and oxidation into the primary metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and the secondary metabolites, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxhexyl)phthalate (5-OH-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (5-oxo-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (5-cx-MEPP), and mono-[(2-carboxymethyl)hexyl] phthalate (2-cx-MMHP). Very few studies have been reported on the adverse effects of DEHP metabolites, and the available information indicates that the metabolites might also be equally or more active as compared to the parent compound. In the present study, induced fit docking was used for structural binding characterization of the above five DEHP metabolites with androgen receptor (AR) to predict the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of these metabolites in AR signaling. All the DEHP metabolites interacted with the ligand-binding pocket of AR forming amino-acid residue interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi interactions. The binding energy of DEHP with AR was similar to that of native ligand testosterone. The amino-acid residue interactions of DEHP metabolites had 91–100% similarity compared to that of testosterone. In addition, all the DEHP metabolites and testosterone showed a common hydrogen bonding interaction with amino-acid Arg-752 of AR. Taken together, the structural binding data in the present study suggested the potential for DEHP metabolites to disrupt AR signaling, which may lead to androgen-related reproductive dysfunction.","Beg M.A., Sheikh I.A.",10.3390/toxics8040115,Toxics
"Prospective Outcomes Of Noma Facial Reconstructive Surgery In Sokoto, Nigeria","Background: Noma is a gangrenous infection of the face that results in severe facial deformity, occurring primarily in malnourished and impoverished populations. Objective: To assess clinician- and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) before and after reconstructive surgery for patients with noma in northwest Nigeria. Methods: Objective outcomes were recorded using the noma-specific NOITULP (nose, outer cheek, inner cheek, trismus, upper/lower lip, particularities) classification system. PROs were recorded using a locally developed tool. Postsurgical changes were assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank testing. Linear regression was used to look for associated risk factors. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the NOITULP score was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic. Results: Forty-nine patients (median age 25 years, 71% male) underwent local/regional flap reconstruction and/or trismus release. Twelve complications were reported. Univariate analysis showed a 3.20 change in PRO score (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 5.81, p = 0.018) per kilogram the patient underwent at time of surgery. The NOITULP score improved from a presurgery median of 3.5 to 2.3 (p < 0.0001), however, the IRR was poor (kappa = 0.0894, p < 0.0001). The PRO score also improved from a median of 7.0 to 12.0 (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Facial reconstructive surgery improves the NOITULP score and PROs in patients with noma in northwest Nigeria.

Comparing The Efficacy Of Antimicrobial Pocket-Irrigation Protocols In An In Vivo Breast Implant Infection Model,"Background: Breast implant infection and biofilm formation are major concerns in reconstructive and esthetic breast surgery, with significant medical and economic consequences. Staphylococcus is the common pathogen, with rapidly increasing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is no consensus on prevention practices. This study compares the effect of several pocket irrigation and antibiotic prophylaxis regimens on implant colonization and biofilm formation in an established rat model of MRSA-infected silicone breast implants. Methods: Silicone discs were inserted in a sub-pectoral pocket in 57 rats (114 implants). Implant infection was induced by injection of free planktonic MRSA into the surgical pocket. Rats were allocated to study groups treated by different antimicrobial protocols: pocket irrigation with vancomycin, povidone-iodine, or saline. Each group was divided into subgroups treated with or without additional peri-operative systemic vancomycin. Implant colonization or overt infection was assessed at post-operative day 14 both clinically and by cultures. Results: Pocket irrigation with vancomycin prevented contamination in 87% of implants. Irrigation and systemic vancomycin prevented contamination in 100% of implants with no difference between a single preoperative dose and a 48-h regimen. Systemic vancomycin alone or irrigation with povidone-iodine alone resulted in 100% contamination rates. Conclusions: In this in vivo model, combination of systemic vancomycin with vancomycin pocket irrigation was the most effective regimen, preventing contamination in 100% of implants. Continuation of post-operative antibiotic treatment showed no added advantage.","Gofstein-Hayuth D., Fliss E., Barnea Y., Legarda C., Bracha G., Lerner A., Lellouche J., Carmeli Y., Shani N., Arad E.",10.1016/j.bjps.2023.06.062,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
"Microplastic Distributions In A Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant: Removal Efficiency, Seasonal Variation And Influence Of Sampling Technique","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as an important route of microplastics (MPs) to the environment. Therefore, more effective MPs sampling and detection methodologies, as well as a better understanding of their influence on MPs occurrence and distributions in WWTP effluents, are needed for better removal and control. In this work, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs was assessed by collecting samples from raw to tertiary effluent during a 12-month sampling campaign (season-based) using different sampling methods (containers, 24-h composite and large grab samples). MPs retrieved from different treatment units within the WWTP were identified and quantified using plastic/non-plastic staining followed by optical microscopy, SEM and μ-Raman microscopy. Overall, the mean removal efficiency of MPs in the WWTP was 97%, with most MPs removed by the secondary stage and a mean effluent concentration of 1.97 MPs L(−1) after sand filtration. The relative abundance of particles was lower than fibers in treated effluent compared with the raw wastewater, with MP fibers constituting 74% of the total MPs in raw wastewater and 91% in treated effluent. Taking seasonal variations into account is important as total MPs concentration in the effluent was notably higher in winter compared with the other seasons. Increasing the sampled volume using large samples or 24-h composite samples significantly reduced the variability between replicates. However, MPs concentration post the tertiary stage was significantly lower using morning sampling (9 am) by large grab sampling method (1.2 MPs L(−1)) compared to 24-h composite sampling (3.2 MPs L(−1)) possibly due to intra-daily changes. Using a finer mesh size (0.45 μm) to capture MPs beyond the size range typically studied (≥20 μm) effectively doubled the number of MPs detected in the tertiary effluent and highlights the importance of standardizing sampling procedures.","Ben-David E.A., Habibi M., Haddad E., Hasanin M., Angel D.L., Booth A.M., Sabbah I.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141880,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects Of Long-Term Microplastic Pollution On Soil Heavy Metals And Metal Resistance Genes: Distribution Patterns And Synergistic Effects,"Heavy metals (HMs) and microplastics (MPs) are two emerging factors threatening global food security. Whether long-term MPs pollution will affect the distribution of HMs and their resistance genes (MRGs) in soil is unknown. Here, metagenomic approach was used to decipher the fate of MRGs in cropland soils with long-term film MPs residues. Similar distribution pattern of MRGs was formed in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. A total of 202 MRG subtypes were detected, with resistance genes for Multimetal, Cu, and As being the most prevalent type of MRGs. MRGs formed a modular distribution of five clusters centered on MRGs including ruvB in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. MRGs also formed tight co-occurrence networks with mobile genetic elements (MGEs: integrons, insertions and plasmids). Redundancy analysis showed that HMs together with microbial communities and MGEs affected the distribution of MRGs in soil. Thirteen genera including Pseudomonas were identified as potential hosts for MRGs and MGEs. The research provides preliminary progress on the synergistic effect of HMs and MPs in affecting soil ecological security. The synergistic effect of MPs and HMs needs to be considered in the remediation of contaminated soils.","Wu C., Song X., Wang D., Ma Y., Ren X., Hu H., Shan Y., Ma X., Cui J., Ma Y.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115180,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Genomic Scan Of A Healthcare-Associated Ndm-1-Producing Citrobacter Freundii St18 Isolated From A Green Sea Turtle Impacted By Plastic Pollution,"Background: Carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter freundii has been reported as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Particularly, C. freundii belonging to the sequence type (ST) 18 is considered to be an emerging nosocomial clone. Objectives: To report the genomic background and phylogenomic analysis of a multidrug-resistant NDM-1-producing C. freundii ST18 (strain CF135931) isolated from an endangered green sea turtle affected by plastic pollution in Brazil. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. De novo assembly was performed by CLC Workbench, and in silico analysis accomplished by bioinformatics tools. For phylogenomic analysis, publicly available C. freundii (txid:546) genome assemblies were retrieved from the NCBI database. Results: The genome size was calculated at 5 290 351 bp, comprising 5263 total genes, 4 rRNAs, 77 tRNAs, 11ncRNAs, and 176 pseudogenes. The strain belonged to C. freundii ST18, whereas resistome analysis predicted genes encoding resistance to β-lactams (bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-1), bla(CMY-117), and bla(TEM-1C)), aminoglycosides (aph(3′')-Ib, aadA16, aph(3′)-VI, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, and aph(6)-Id), quinolones (aac(6′)-Ib-cr), macrolides (mph(A) and erm(B)), sulphonamides (sul1 and sul2), tetracyclines (tetA and tetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA27). The phylogenomic analysis revealed that CF135931 strain is closely related to international human-associated ST18 clones producing NDM-1. Conclusion: Genomic surveillance efforts are necessary for robust monitoring of the emergence of drug-resistant strains and WHO critical priority pathogens within a One Health framework. In this regard, this draft genome and associated data can improve understanding of dissemination dynamics of nosocomial clones of carbapenemase-producing C. freundii beyond hospital walls. In fact, the emergence of NDM-1-producing C. freundii of global ST18 in wildlife deserves considerable attention.","Aravena-Ramírez V., Fuentes-Castillo D., Vilaça S.T., Goldberg D.W., Esposito F., Silva-Pereira T.T., Fontana H., Sellera F.P., Lincopan N.",10.1016/j.jgar.2024.01.006,Journal Of Global Antimicrobial Resistance
Clinical And Pathological Analyses Of Chronic Vascular Rejection After Kidney Transplantation,"Aim We discuss the clinicopathological analysis of cases of chronic vascular rejection (CVR) cases after renal transplantation and clarify the mechanisms underlying the development and prognostic significance of CVR. Patients CVR was diagnosed in 46 renal allograft biopsy specimens (BS) obtained from 34 renal transplant patients being followed up at the Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, between January 2009 and December 2013. Results CVR was diagnosed at a median of 47.4 months post-transplant. Among the 36 patients, 23 had a history of acute rejection. Among the 46 BS showing evidence of CVR, the CVR was mild (cv1 in Banff's classification) in 23, moderate (cv2) in 17, and severe (cv3) in 6. Of the 40 samples obtained at the time of the biopsy and assayed with plastic beads coated with HLA antigen, 31 (78%) showed circulating ant-HLA alloantibody, and 15 (38%) showed donor-specific antibodies. We then classified the 46 BS showing evidence of CVR by their overall histopathological features, as follows; cv alone was seen in 16 (35%) BS, cv + antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in 26 (56%), and cv + T-cell-mediated rejection in 9 (19%). Loss of the renal allograft occurred during the observation period in nine of the patients (26%). Of the remaining patients with functioning grafts, deterioration of the renal allograft function after the biopsies occurred in 11 patients (32%). Conclusion The results of our study suggest that AMR may underlie CVR in many cases, while T cell-mediated rejection may play an important role in some cases.","Shimizu T., Toma H., Shibahara R., Tsunoyama K., Izuka J., Nozaki T., Ishida H., Tanabe K., Honda K., Koike J.",10.1111/nep.12464,Nephrology
"In Vitro And In Silico Assessment Of Anti-Biofilm And Anti-Quorum Sensing Properties Of 2,4-Di-Tert Butylphenol Against Acinetobacter Baumannii","Introduction. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen with a high potential to cause food-borne infections. It is designated as a critical pathogen by the World Health Organization due to its multi-drug resistance and mortalities reported. Biofilm governs major virulence factors, which promotes drug resistance in A. baumannii. Thus, a compound with minimum selection pressure on the pathogen can be helpful to breach biofilm-related virulence. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. To identify anti-biofilm and anti-virulent metabolites from extracts of wild Mangifera indica (mango) brine pickle bacteria that diminishes pathogenesis and resistance of A. baumannii. Aim. This study reports anti-biofilm and anti-quorum sensing (QS) efficacy of secondary metabolites from bacterial isolates of fermented food origin. Method. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) of 13 bacterial isolates from fermented mango brine pickles were screened for their efficiency in inhibiting biofilm formation and GC-MS was used to identify its metabolites. Anti-biofilm metabolite was tested on early and mature biofilms, pellicle formation, extra polymeric substances (EPS), cellular adherence, motility and resistance of A. baumannii. Gene expression and in silico studies were also carried out to validate the compounds efficacy. Results. CFS of TMP6b identified as Bacillus vallismortis, inhibited biofilm production (83.02%). Of these, major compound was identified as 2,4-Di-tert-butyl phenol (2,4-DBP). At sub-lethal concentrations, 2,4-DBP disrupted both early and mature biofilm formation. Treatment with 2,4-DBP destructed in situ biofilm formed on glass and plastic. In addition, key virulence traits like pellicle (77.5%), surfactant (95.3%), EPS production (3-fold) and cell adherence (65.55%) reduced significantly. A. baumannii cells treated with 2,4-DBP showed enhanced sensitivity towards antibiotics, oxide radicals and blood cells. Expression of biofilm-concomitant virulence genes like csuA/B, pgaC, pgaA, bap, bfmR, katE and ompA along with QS genes abaI, abaR significantly decreased. The in silico studies further validated the higher binding affinity of 2,4-DBP to the AbaR protein than the cognate ligand molecule. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate 2,4- DBP has anti-pathogenic potential alone and with antibiotics by in vitro, and in silico studies against A. baumannii. It also indicates its potential use in therapeutics and bio-preservatives.","Jha N.K., Gopu V., Sivasankar C., Singh S.R., Devi P.B., Murali A., Shetty P.H.",10.1099/jmm.0.001813,Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Insights Into The Microbiome Of Breast Implants And Periprosthetic Tissue In Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma,"Though rare, breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a CD30+ T-cell lymphoma associated with textured breast implants, has adversely impacted our perception of the safety of breast implants. Its etiology unknown, one hypothesis suggests an initiating inflammatory stimulus, possibly infectious, triggers BIA-ALCL. We analyzed microbiota of breast, skin, implant and capsule in BIA-ALCL patients (n = 7), and controls via culturing methods, 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria were calculated, and phylogenetic trees constructed. Staphylococcus spp., the most commonly cultured microbes, were identified in both the BIA-ALCL and contralateral control breast. The diversity of bacterial microbiota did not differ significantly between BIA-ALCL and controls for any material analyzed. Further, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria between BIA-ALCL and control specimens. Heat maps suggested substantial diversity in the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the skin, breast, implant and capsule between patients with no clear trend to distinguish BIA-ALCL from controls. While we identified no consistent differences between patients with BIA-ALCL-affected and contralateral control breasts, this study provides insights into the composition of the breast microbiota in this population.","Walker J.N., Hanson B.M., Pinkner C.L., Simar S.R., Pinkner J.S., Parikh R., Clemens M.W., Hultgren S.J., Myckatyn T.M.",10.1038/s41598-019-46535-8,Scientific Reports
Participation Of The Hospitals In The Republic Of Ireland In International Research Over More Than A Decade: A Bibliometric Analysis,"Background: This study provides an accurate awareness of the present situation of health research in Irish hospitals both public and private. We aimed to analyze factors that may influence it and provide recommendations for active steps to improve the current situation of Irish health research based on our findings. Methods: We performed a bibliometric analysis to assess qualitatively and quantitatively the publications from Ireland over a period between 2007 and 2018. We also investigated the associated variables with the quality of research. Furthermore, we conducted a Joinpoint analysis to see the trends in Irish research over these years. Results: From 12,828 included peer-reviewed articles, the average citation count per article was 19.98. Furthermore, we showed that a higher impact factor (IF) and institutions number, present per article, were significantly associated with more citations. Also, the publication count and the mean IF showed an increase over the years according to the Joinpoint analysis. Moreover, the oncology research had the highest output, followed by pediatrics, then neurology while the specialties with least publications were ear, nose, and throat (ENT), urology, plastic surgery, and dentistry. Additionally, cardiovascular, obstetrics and gynecology, oncology, pediatrics, pulmonology, dermatology, ophthalmology, dentistry, and radiology research showed an increased publication count trend in recent years. While anesthesiology, ENT, general surgery, gastroenterology and hepatology, infection and tropical medicine, nephrology, neurology, orthopedics, plastic surgery, and urology showed a decrease in the publications trend. Conclusions: Our findings may serve as a useful approach to benchmark scientific output from hospitals and guide the future allocation of research spending.","Abdelaal Ahmed Mahmoud A., Younis M.I., Holmes C., Sallam A., Kamel M.G., Dempsey E., Mulhern O.",10.1007/s11845-019-02077-6,Irish Journal Of Medical Science
Bacteriophages As Therapeutic & Disinfectant Agents To Tackle Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii,"Background & objectives: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious threat for human health worldwide. The studies on agents targeting A. baumannii are imperative due to identified A. baumannii co-infections in COVID-19. Bacteriophages are promising antibacterial agents against drug-resistant bacteria. This study intended to isolate bacteriophages against MDR A. baumannii from the water of river Ganga, to be used potentially as therapeutic and disinfectant particles. Methods: Acinetobacter phages were isolated from the Ganga water collected from Kanpur and further tested on 50 MDR A. baumannii isolates to determine host range. The phages were morphologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The disinfectant property of the isolated phages was tested by spraying of bacteriophage cocktail on MDR A. baumannii contaminated plastic surface, analyzed by colony-forming unit (CFU) and bioluminescence assay (adenosine triphosphate monitoring). Results: A total of seven bacteriophages were isolated against MDR A. baumannii. The bacteriophages lysed three MDR A. baumannii isolates out of 50 tested, showing narrow host range. Electron microscopy revealed hexagonal heads and long tails of bacteriophages, belonging to order Caudovirales. The bacteriophage cocktail reduced the MDR A. baumannii load efficiently on plastic surface, evidenced by reduction in CFUs and bioluminescence. Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the isolated bacteriophages are potential lytic agents for MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates, and may be used as potential therapeutic agents as well as disinfectant to combat MDR A. baumannii with due consideration to phage host specificity, with further characterization.","Rathor N., Bahadur T., Thakur C.K., Bamola V.D., Das B.K., Chaudhry R.",10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_355_21,Indian Journal Of Medical Research
An Asian Perspective On Povidone Iodine In Wound Healing,"Antiseptics, with a broader spectrum of antimicrobial efficacy, lower risk of antibiotic resistance development, and minimal collateral damage to host tissues, are important alternatives to control the bioburden in wounds. Povidone iodine (PVP-I), in use for several decades, has the broadest spectrum of activity, a persistent antimicrobial effect, an ability to penetrate biofilms, and a lack of acquired or cross-resistance. It demonstrates good skin tolerance and low cytotoxicity. However, some reports on PVP-I have raised concerns over allergy, ineffective penetration, and toxic effects on host cells. The majority of these concerns are based on in vitro or rodent wound studies with diverse study designs and outcomes; these results may not be directly applicable in the clinical reality in humans. In this paper, we discuss the efficacy and safety of PVP-I and outline its place in wound healing in Asia, based on an appraisal of recent literature and clinical practice across the region.","Bigliardi P., Langer S., Cruz J.J., Kim S.W., Nair H., Srisawasdi G.",10.1159/000479150,Dermatology
Expander/Implant Removal After Breast Reconstruction: Analysis Of Risk Factors And Timeline,"INTRODUCTION: Removal of tissue expanders (TE) or implants is a dire consequence of breast reconstruction, and has the potential to halt the reconstructive efforts. Our goals were to characterize a cohort of patients with TE/implant removal, to perform a time-based analysis, and to review the bacteriology associated with explanted devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify patients who underwent TE/implant removal. Patient characteristics, surgical technique, adjuvant therapies, indications, complications, culture results were obtained. Data were analyzed according to timing of explantation. RESULTS: A total of 55 TE and implants were removed in 43 patients. Reasons for explantation were infection (58%), patient request (22%), and wound-related complications (20%). The majority of explantations occurred after 30 days (62%), and after Stage I (81%). Median days to explantation was 62. Patients of older age (p = 0.01) and higher BMI (p = 0.02) were more likely to undergo explantation after Stage I. The most commonly cultured organisms were S. epidermidis (10.9%), S. aureus (10.9%) and P. aeruginosa (10.9%). Antibiotic resistance was commonly encountered for ampicillin, cefazolin, penicillin, and erythromycin. CONCLUSION: Infection is the most common reason for explantation after prosthetic breast reconstruction. Patients should be carefully monitored for a prolonged period of time after Stage I, as the majority of explantations occur in this stage but beyond 30 days. For oral treatment, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and for IV treatment a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenems/carbapenems appear to be appropriate choices according to our culture results.

Inhibition Of Irf8 Negatively Regulates Macrophage Function And Impairs Cutaneous Wound Healing,"The inflammatory response is essential for normal cutaneous wound healing. Macrophages, as critical inflammatory cells, coordinate inflammation and angiogenesis phases during wound healing. It has been reported that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a member of the IRF family, plays a critical role in the development and function of macrophages and is associated with inflammation. However, the role of IRF8 in cutaneous wound healing and its underlying mechanism remain elusive. Through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, we showed that IRF8 is involved in the wound repair process in mice and patients. Furthermore, we ascertain that the repression of IRF8 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to delayed wound healing. To explore the mechanism by which IRF8 impacts wound healing, we observed its effect on macrophage-related mediators by IHC or real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of IRF8 decreases the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators associated with M1 macrophage (il-1b, il-6, inos, and tnf-a) but no impact on M2 macrophage-related mediators (arg-1, mrc-1, and il-10) and the number of macrophages in the wounds. Furthermore, the inhibition of IRF8 induced apoptosis in the wounds. In summary, this study demonstrates that the down-regulation of IRF8 in the wound leads to impaired wound healing possibly through the regulation of macrophage function and apoptosis in skin wound.","Guo Y., Yang Z., Wu S., Xu P., Peng Y., Yao M.",10.1007/s10753-016-0454-8,Inflammation
Soft Surface Nanostructure With Semi-Free Polyionic Components For Sustainable Antimicrobial Plastic,"Surface antimicrobial materials are of interest as they can combat the critical threat of microbial contamination without contributing to issues of environmental contamination and the development drug resistance. Most nanostructured surfaces are prepared by post fabrication modifications and actively release antimicrobial agents. These properties limit the potential applications of nanostructured materials on flexible surfaces. Here, we report on an easily synthesized plastic material with inherent antimicrobial activity, demonstrating excellent microbicidal properties against common bacteria and fungus. The plastic material did not release antimicrobial components as they were anchored to the polymer chains via strong covalent bonds. Time-kill kinetics studies have shown that bactericidal effects take place when bacteria come into contact with a material for a prolonged period, resulting in the deformation and rupture of bacteria cells. A scanning probe microscopy analysis revealed soft nanostructures on the submicron scale, for which the formation is thought to occur via surface phase separation. These soft nanostructures allow for polyionic antimicrobial components to be present on the surface, where they freely interact with and kill microbes. Overall, the new green and sustainable plastic is easily synthesized and demonstrates inherent and long-lasting activity without toxic chemical leaching.","Chan S.P., Lim D.S.W., Armugam A., Yi G., Zhang Y.",10.3390/ijms222212315,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Mid-Term Clinical Results Of Chronic Cavitary Long Bone Osteomyelitis Treatment Using S53P4 Bioactive Glass: A Multi-Center Study,"Introduction: Chronic osteomyelitis is a challenging condition in the orthopedic practice and traditionally treated using local and systemic antibiotics in a two-stage surgical procedure. With the introduction of the antimicrobial biomaterial S53P4 bioactive glass (Bonalive®), chronic osteomyelitis can be treated in a one-stage procedure. This study evaluated the mid-term clinical results of patients treated with S53P4 bioactive glass for long bone chronic osteomyelitis. Methods: In this prospective multi-center study, patients from two different university medical centers in the Netherlands were included. One-stage treatment consisted of debridement surgery, implantation of S53P4 bioactive glass, and treatment with culture-based systemic antibiotics. If required, wound closure by a plastic surgeon was performed. The primary outcome was the eradication of infection, and a secondary statistical analysis was performed on probable risk factors for treatment failure. Results: In total, 78 patients with chronic cavitary long bone osteomyelitis were included. Follow-up was at least 12 months (mean 46; standard deviation, SD, 20), and 69 patients were treated in a one-stage procedure. Overall infection eradication was 85 %, and 1-year infection-free survival was 89 %. Primary closure versus local/muscular flap coverage is the only risk factor for treatment failure. Conclusion: With 85 % eradication of infection, S53P4 bioactive glass is an effective biomaterial in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis in a one-stage procedure. A major risk factor for treatment failure is the necessity for local/free muscle flap coverage. These results confirm earlier published data, and together with the fundamentally different antimicrobial pathways without antibiotic resistance, S53P4 bioactive glass is a recommendable biomaterial for chronic osteomyelitis treatment and might be beneficial over other biomaterials.","Van Vugt T.A.G., Heidotting J., Arts J.J., Ploegmakers J.J.W., Jutte P.C., Geurts J.A.P.",10.5194/jbji-6-413-2021,Journal Of Bone And Joint Infection
The Enterococcus: A Model Of Adaptability To Its Environment,"The genus Enterococcus comprises a ubiquitous group of Gram-positive bacteria that are of great relevance to human health for their role as major causative agents of health care-associated infections. The enterococci are resilient and versatile species able to survive under harsh conditions, making them well adapted to the health care environment. Two species cause the majority of enterococcal infections: Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Both species demonstrate intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics, such as virtually all cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, a remarkably plastic genome allows these two species to readily acquire resistance to further antibiotics, such as high-level aminoglycoside resistance, high-level ampicillin resistance, and vancomycin resistance, either through mutation or by horizontal transfer of genetic elements conferring resistance determinants.","García-Solache M., Rice L.B.",10.1128/CMR.00058-18,Clinical Microbiology Reviews
Biodegradable Mg-Cu Alloy Implants With Antibacterial Activity For The Treatment Of Osteomyelitis: In Vitro And In Vivo Evaluations,"Treatment of chronic osteomyelitis (bone infection) remains a clinical challenge; in particular, it requires an implantable material with improved antibacterial activity. Here, we prepared biodegradable magnesium (Mg)-copper (Cu) alloys with different Cu contents (0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 wt%) and assessed their potential for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced osteomyelitis. We evaluated the microstructures, mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and ion release of the alloys in vitro, and their biocompatibility and antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. The antibacterial activity of the Mg-Cu alloys in vitro was demonstrated by microbiological counting assays, bacterial viability assays, biofilm formation observations, and the expression of biofilm, virulence, and antibiotic-resistance associated genes. The antibacterial activity of Mg-Cu alloys in vivo was confirmed by imaging examination, microbiological cultures, and histopathology. The biocompatibility of Mg-Cu alloys was confirmed by cell proliferation, vitality, and morphology assays in vitro and Cu(2+) or Mg(2+) ion assays, blood biochemical tests, and histological evaluation in vivo. The alloy containing 0.25 wt% Cu exhibited the highest antibacterial activity among the tested alloys, with favorable biocompatibility. Collectively, our results indicate the potential utility of Mg-Cu alloy implants with 0.25 wt% Cu in treating orthopedic infections.","Li Y., Liu L., Wan P., Zhai Z., Mao Z., Ouyang Z., Yu D., Sun Q., Tan L., Ren L., Zhu Z., Hao Y., Qu X., Yang K., Dai K.",10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.08.031,Biomaterials
Effective Disinfection Of A Burn Unit After Two Cases Of Sepsis Caused By Multi-Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii,"Background: The healthcare environment is a potential source of microbial pathogens, which may promote infectious cross-transmission. Terminal automated cleaning methods such as hydrogen peroxide systems have proven to be more successful than manual techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an automated aerosolized hydrogen peroxide/silver cations dry-mist system. The goal was to prevent microbial transmission to patients in a clinical setting after two cases of sepsis caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii had been diagnosed in a burn unit that relied on manual cleaning techniques. Materials and Methods: Samples were taken from room surfaces before and after the dry-mist system cycle, which was used to disinfect all burn unit rooms after patient discharge. The disinfection effectiveness was assessed using contact plate cultures, with microbial growth represented as the total number of colony forming units per square centimeter (CFUs/cm(2)). Results: No positive cultures from surface samples were observed after the intervention with the dry-mist system. Specifically, no further Acinetobacter baumannii growth was detected. Conclusions: Our results support the use of the hydrogen peroxide/silver cations dry-mist system as an adjunct to standard manual cleaning and disinfection protocols used in the healthcare environment because of its broad-spectrum and high antimicrobial activity. This system may be a valuable option to consider, particularly in the control of microbial outbreaks.","Cobrado L., Pinto Silva A., Pina-Vaz C., Rodrigues A.",10.1089/sur.2017.311,Surgical Infections
"Advanced Oxidation Processes For The Elimination Of Microplastics From Aqueous Systems: Assessment Of Efficiency, Perspectives And Limitations","Microplastics act as a vector of heavy metals, organic pollutants, pathogens and resistance genes in the environment further aggravate the pollution of plastics. The conventional wastewater/water treatment processes can physically capture and remove most of microplastics, but the success rates varies. How to quickly remove a large amount of microplastics from aqueous system is a key research topic at present. Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as a green elimination strategy has attracted attention because of its effective elimination, strong destruction and safety. The molecular chain of microplastics can be gradually degraded into small molecular organics until H(2)O and CO(2) by strong oxidizing free radical produced by AOPs. Unfortunately, problematically, the elimination of microplastics in aqueous system by AOPs is recently carried out on a laboratory scale. The application and implementation of this strategy are restricted by long reaction time, low liquid phase degradation efficiency and the formation of nanoplastics. Generally, the technology is still in its infancy, and most studies are carried out under laboratory conditions. The degradation of microplastics in aqueous system also needs appropriate conditions, but it is not always feasible under field conditions in AOPs. Although AOPs can be used as a green degradation technology to eliminate microplastics in aqueous systems in theory, it still needs to be furtherly explored in practical application. Consequently, before AOPs as a green elimination strategy is successfully applied to the effective remove microplastics, more in-depth research is still required, such as the setting from single condition to complex environment, the transfer from laboratory scale to field scale, and systematic toxicity evaluation of corresponding products.","Shen M., Song B., Zhou C., Hu T., Zeng G., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156723,Science Of The Total Environment
Antimicrobial Amino-Functionalized Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Quantum Dots For Eliminating Multidrug-Resistant Species In Dual-Modality Photodynamic Therapy And Bioimaging Under Two-Photon Excitation,"Developing a nanomaterial, for use in highly efficient dual-modality two-photon photodynamic therapy (PDT) involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and for use as a two-photon imaging contrast probe, is currently desirable. Here, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) doped with nitrogen and functionalized with an amino group (amino-N-GQDs) serving as a photosensitizer in PDT had the superior ability to generate ROS as compared to unmodified GQDs. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) species were completely eliminated at an ultralow energy (239.36 nJ pixel-1) through only 12 s two-photon excitation (TPE) in the near-infrared region (800 nm). Furthermore, the amino-N-GQDs had an absorption wavelength of approximately 800 nm, quantum yield of 0.33, strong luminescence, an absolute cross section of approximately 54 356 Göeppert-Mayer units, a lifetime of 1.09 ns, a ratio of the radiative to nonradiative decay rates of approximately 0.49, and high two-photon stability under TPE. These favorable properties enabled the amino-N-GQDs to act as a two-photon contrast probe for tracking and localizing analytes through in-depth two-photon imaging in a three-dimensional biological environment and concurrently easily eliminating MDR species through PDT.","Kuo W.-S., Shao Y.-T., Huang K.-S., Chou T.-M., Yang C.-H.",10.1021/acsami.8b01429,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces

Mg(2+)-Dependent Mechanism Of Environmental Versatility In A Multidrug Efflux Pump,"Tripartite resistance nodulation and cell division multidrug efflux pumps span the periplasm and are a major driver of multidrug resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. The periplasm provides a distinct environment between the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Cations, such as Mg(2+), become concentrated within the periplasm and, in contrast to the cytoplasm, its pH is sensitive to conditions outside the cell. Here, we reveal an interplay between Mg(2+) and pH in modulating the dynamics of the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, and its function within the prototypical AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump from Escherichia coli. In the absence of Mg(2+), AcrA becomes increasingly plastic within acidic conditions, but when Mg(2+) is bound this is ameliorated, resulting in domain specific organisation in neutral to weakly acidic regimes. We establish a unique histidine residue directs these structural dynamics and is essential for sustaining pump efflux activity across acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. Overall, we propose Mg(2+) conserves the structural mobility of AcrA to ensure optimal AcrAB-TolC function within rapid changing environments commonly faced by the periplasm during bacterial infection and colonization. This work highlights that Mg(2+) is an important mechanistic component in this pump class and possibly across other periplasmic lipoproteins.","Lewis B.R., Uddin M.R., Kuo K.M., Shah L.M.N., Harris N.J., Booth P.J., Hammerschmid D., Gumbart J.C., Zgurskaya H.I., Reading E.",10.1101/2024.06.10.597921,Biorxiv
"Metagenomic Insights Into The Functional Potential Of Non-Sanitary Landfill Microbiomes In The Indian Himalayan Region, Highlighting Key Plastic Degrading Genes","Solid waste management in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is a growing challenge, intensified by increasing population and tourism, which strain non-sanitary landfills. This study investigates microbial diversity and functional capabilities within these landfills using a high-throughput shotgun metagenomic approach. Physicochemical analysis revealed that the Manali and Mandi landfill sites were under heavy metal contamination and thermal stress. Taxonomic annotation identified a dominance of bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, with genera like Pseudomonas and Bacillus prevalent. Squeezemeta analysis generated 9,216,983 open reading frames (ORFs) across the sampling sites, highlighting diverse metabolic potentials for heavy metal resistance and degrading organic, xenobiotics and plastic wastes. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) identified distinct gene clusters in Manali and Mandi landfill sites, reflecting differences in pollution profiles. Functional redundancy of landfill microbiome was observed with notable xenobiotic and plastic degradation pathways. This is the first comprehensive metagenomic assessment of non-sanitary landfills in the IHR, providing valuable insights into the microbial roles in degrading persistent pollutants, plastic waste, and other contaminants in these stressed environments.","Lepcha A., Kumar R., Dindhoria K., Bhargava B., Pati A.M., Kumar R.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136642,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Antibiotic Use Among Surgical Inpatients At A Tertiary Health Facility: A Case For A Standardized Protocol For Presumptive Antimicrobial Therapy In The Developing World,"Background: Indiscriminate antimicrobial use is one of the greatest contributors to antimicrobial resistance. A low level of asepsis in hospitals and inadequate laboratory support have been adduced as reasons for indiscriminate use of antimicrobials among surgical patients. At present, there are no guidelines for presumptive antibiotic use in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa. Aim: Surgical inpatients at the study hospital were surveyed to determine the level of antimicrobial use and degree of compliance with prescription quality indicators. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among all surgical inpatients in May 2019 using a standardized tool developed by the University of Antwerp to assess the point prevalence of antimicrobials. Inpatients who were admitted from 08:00 h on the day of the survey were included. Data on patients' demographics, indication for antimicrobial use, reason for antimicrobial use, stop/review date, adherence to guidelines and laboratory use were collected. The prevalence of antimicrobial use in the surgical department was estimated. Results: Eighty-two inpatients were included in the survey. Of these, 97.6% were receiving at least one antimicrobial agent. Only 5.4% of the prescriptions were targeted, and 37.6% of prescriptions were for empirical treatment of infections. Approximately half (50.7%) of the patients were receiving presumptive antibiotics, and 6% were receiving prophylactic antibiotics. In total, 58.7% of prescriptions were administered parenterally, and 98.2% of patients had documentation of a stop/review date. Metronidazole (P=32.3%, T=29.2%), ceftriaxone (P=28.4%, T=19.8%) and ciprofloxacin (P=14.2%, T=14.6%) were the most common antimicrobials used. Conclusions: There is a high rate of antimicrobial use among surgical inpatients, and the rate of indiscriminate antimicrobial prescribing among these patients needs to be reduced. This can be achieved by developing antimicrobial guidelines for presumptive antimicrobial therapy.","Nnadozie U.U., Umeokonkwo C.D., Maduba C.C., Igwe-Okomiso D., Onah C.K., Madubueze U.C., Anikwe C.C., Versporten A., Pauwels I., Goossens H., Ogbuanya A.U.-O., Oduyebo O.O., Onwe E.O.",10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100078,Infection Prevention In Practice
Which Micropollutants In Water Environments Deserve More Attention Globally?,"Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer.","Yang Y., Zhang X., Jiang J., Han J., Li W., Li X., Yee Leung K.M., Snyder S.A., Alvarez P.J.",10.1021/acs.est.1c04250,Environmental Science And Technology
The Link Of Feast-Phase Dissolved Oxygen (Do) With Substrate Competition And Microbial Selection In Pha Production,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biobased and biodegradable polyesters with the potential to replace conventional plastics. Aeration requires large amounts of energy in PHA production by mixed microbial cultures (MMCs), particularly during the feast phase due to substrate uptake. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of DO concentrations on microbial selection, substrate competition and PHA production performance by MMCs. This represents the first study investigating DO impact on PHA production while feeding the multiple volatile fatty acids (VFAs) typically encountered in real fermented feedstocks, as well as the substrate preferences at different DO levels. Efficient microbial cultures were enriched under both high (3.47 ± 1.12 mg/L) and low (0.86 ± 0.50 mg/L) DO conditions in the feast phase containing mostly the same populations but with different relative abundance. The most abundant microorganisms in the two MMCs were Plasticicumulans, Zoogloea, Paracoccus, and Flavobacterium. Butyrate and valerate were found to be the preferred substrates as compared to acetate and propionate regardless of DO concentrations. In the accumulation step, the PHA storage capacity and yield were less affected by the change of DO levels when applying the culture selected under low DO in the feast phase (PHA storage capacity >60% and yield > 0.9 Cmol PHA/Cmol VFA). A high DO level is required for maximal PHA accumulation rates with the four VFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate) present, due to the lower specific uptake rates of acetate and propionate under low DO conditions. However, butyrate and valerate specific uptake rates were less impacted by DO levels and hence low DO for PHA accumulation may be effective when feed is composed of these substrates only.","Wang X., Oehmen A., Freitas E.B., Carvalho G., Reis M.A.M.",10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.064,Water Research

The Evolutionary Advantage Of Heritable Phenotypic Heterogeneity,"Phenotypic plasticity is an evolutionary driving force in diverse biological processes, including the adaptive immune system, the development of neoplasms, and the persistence of pathogens despite drug pressure. It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers on cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population of individuals that can express only a single phenotype. We show that the advantage of such a mutation depends on the degree of phenotypic heritability between generations, called phenotypic memory. We analyze the fixation probability of the phenotypically plastic allele as a function of phenotypic memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In constant environments, plastic alleles are advantageous and their fixation probability increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic allele's fixation. This same optimum memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome persistence and, indirectly, drug resistance.","Carja O., Plotkin J.B.",10.1038/s41598-017-05214-2,Scientific Reports
Do Postoperative Antibiotics Affect Outcomes In Mohs Reconstructive Surgery?,"Objectives/Hypothesis: The prescribing of postoperative antibiotics for patients undergoing Mohs reconstructive surgery has increased in the last decade, while antibiotic resistance has been increasing. We hypothesized that routine prescribing of postoperative antibiotics after Mohs reconstruction does not decrease the risk of surgical site infection. Study Design: Retrospective, single-institution cohort study. Methods: This study assessed patients who underwent Mohs reconstructive surgery from January 1, 2012, to January 29, 2019. The main outcomes assessed included postoperative surgical site infections, partial or full flap/graft necrosis, hematoma, and dehiscence. Results: A total of 900 defects in 800 patients (mean age [range] = 65.3 [21–96], 54.60% female) were identified over the 7-year period. Patient-specific variables reviewed included comorbidities, age, and smoking status. Surgery-specific variables analyzed included defect characteristics, time interval between Mohs micrographic surgery and reconstruction, reconstructive modalities, and use of postoperative antibiotics. All patients received peri-incisional antibiotics. On regression analysis, use of cartilage grafts (odds ratio [OR]: 6.53; 95% CI: 2.1-20.6; P =.001), current smoking status (OR: 6.67; 95% CI: 2.09-21.30; P =.001), full-thickness defects (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-3.4; P =.045), and interpolated flap reconstruction (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0-11.5; P =.049) were associated with an increased risk of postoperative infections. Smoking and cartilage grafting remained significant on bivariable regression modeling. Use of perioperative antibiotics was not associated with a decreased risk of infection (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 0.23-14.21; P =.568). Conclusions: We found no association between postoperative infections after Mohs reconstructive surgery and the use of postoperative antibiotics. These data support a more targeted approach to antibiotic prescribing in Mohs reconstructive surgery.

The Role Of Rna Modification In The Generation Of Acquired Drug Resistance In Glioma,"Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous system. The clinical treatment strategy is mainly surgery combined with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy, but patients can develop drug resistance during treatment, which severely limits its therapeutic efficacy. Epigenetic regulation at the RNA level is plastic and adaptable, and it can induce a variety of tumor responses to drugs. The regulators of RNA modification include methyltransferases, demethylases, and methylation binding proteins; these are also considered to play an important role in the development, prognosis, and therapeutic response of gliomas, which provides a basis for finding new targets of epigenetic drugs and resetting the sensitivity of tumor cells to temozolomide. This review discusses the relationship between the development of adaptive drug resistance and RNA modification in glioma and summarizes the progress of several major RNA modification strategies in this field, especially RNA m6A modification, m5C modification, and adenosine-to-inosine editing.","Yan Y., Wei W., Long S., Ye S., Yang B., Jiang J., Li X., Chen J.",10.3389/fgene.2022.1032286,Frontiers In Genetics
"Microbial Keratitis In Thyroid Eye Disease: Clinical Features, Microbiological Profile, And Treatment Outcome","PURPOSE: To report the incidence, clinical features, microbiologic profile, and risk indicators in the development of microbial keratitis in Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). METHODS: All patients who were diagnosed to have TED and developed microbial keratitis between the years 2009 to 2017 at the Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery service, LV Prasad Eye Institute were included in this retrospective interventional study. The clinical features, microbiological profile, and treatment outcome of the infection were studied. Possible risk factors leading to the development of microbial keratitis were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 patients of TED were evaluated in the 10-year period. Of the 1,000, 13 patients (14 eyes, 1.4%) were diagnosed with microbial keratitis. The average age at presentation was 44 years (range 1969 years). Of the 13 patients, 10 (77%) were men, 12 (92%) were hyperthyroid, and 12 (92%) were active (average clinical activity score 3) at presentation. Average exophthalmometry value in the involved eye was 24.75mm, and severe eyelid retraction (>2mm scleral show) was noted in 13 of 14 eyes. None of the patients had optic nerve compression. Moderate motility restriction (2 in all gazes) was noted in 6 eyes, and severe motility restriction (4 in all gazes) in 8 eyes. At presentation, 11 (85%) had visual acuity of counting fingers at 1 meter or less, The mean follow up from the time of presentation was 18.3 months (range 566 months). Majority of the eyes (8/14) presented with severe infection (panophthalmitis with microbial keratits = 1, total corneal infiltrate with/without melt = 4, severe thinning/perforation = 4). Microbiological work up of 14 eyes revealed presence of gram-negative bacteria in 5 eyes which included Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., and Acinetobacter sp., and gram-positive bacteria in 4 eyes including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., and Staphylococcus sp. Three eyes revealed a mixed infection of E. coli with Alternaria sp, and E. coli with Corynebacterioum amycolatum while 1 had Corynebacterium pseudodiptheriticum, and S. pneumoniae. Two eyes of the bilateral case showed no growth. Antibiotic susceptibility revealed 6 of the 7 gram-negative isolates were multidrug resistant, whereas the gram-positive isolates were susceptible to most drugs tested. Surgical procedures required were tarsorrhaphy in 7 eyes, tissue adhesive with bandage contact lens in 4, evisceration in 4, levator recession in 2, 3-wall orbital decompression in 2, and penetrating keratoplasty in 1 eye. The visual acuity at presentation was counting fingers or worse in 10/14 eyes. Posttreatment, 10 eyes achieved resolution of infiltrate (with visual improvement in 2), and 4 required evisceration. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors large series of TED, microbial keratitis was noted in 1.3% of patients presenting to a tertiary eye center. Majority presented with advanced diseases and ended with a poor outcome. Gram-negative isolates showed multidrug resistance. An association with early phase of active TED (CAS 3 or more), severe eyelid retraction, and moderate-severe motility restriction is suggested.Microbial Keratitis occurs in 1.3% cases of Thyroid Eye Disease.

Antibacterial Activity Testing Methods For Hydrophobic Patterned Surfaces,"One strategy to decrease the incidence of hospital-acquired infections is to avoid the survival of pathogens in the environment by the development of surfaces with antimicrobial activity. To study the antibacterial behaviour of active surfaces, different approaches have been developed of which ISO 22916 is the standard. To assess the performance of different testing methodologies to analyse the antibacterial activity of hydrophobic surface patterned plastics as part of a Horizon 2020 European research project. Four different testing methods were used to study the antibacterial activity of a patterned film, including the ISO 22916 standard, the immersion method, the touch-transfer inoculation method, and the swab inoculation method, this latter developed specifically for this project. The non-realistic test conditions of the ISO 22916 standard showed this method to be non-appropriate in the study of hydrophobic patterned surfaces. The immersion method also showed no differences between patterned films and smooth controls due to the lack of attachment of testing bacteria on both surfaces. The antibacterial activity of films could be demonstrated by the touch-transfer and the swab inoculation methods, that more precisely mimicked the way of high-touch surfaces contamination, and showed to be the best methodologies to test the antibacterial activity of patterned hydrophobic surfaces. A new ISO standard would be desirable as the reference method to study the antibacterial behaviour of patterned surfaces.","Perez-Gavilan A., De Castro J.V., Arana A., Merino S., Retolaza A., Alves S.A., Francone A., Kehagias N., Sotomayor-Torres C.M., Cocina D., Mortera R., Crapanzano S., Pelegrín C.J., Garrigos M.C., Jiménez A., Galindo B., Araque M.C., Dykeman D., Neves N.M., Marimón J.M.",10.1038/s41598-021-85995-9,Scientific Reports
Does The Duration Of Perioperative Antibiotic Prophylaxis Influence The Incidence Of Postoperative Surgical-Site Infections In Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction In Women With Breast Cancer? A Retrospective Study,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is an established concept to reduce the risk of surgical-site infections; however, the optimal treatment duration in prosthetic breast reconstruction is still controversial. This study evaluated a potential association between the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis duration (≤24 hours versus >24 hours) and incidence of postoperative surgical-site infections in immediate implant-based breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective analysis of surgical-site infections after immediate implant-based breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients between January of 2011 and December of 2018 was performed. The incidence of postoperative surgical-site infections in patients with more than 24 hours of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to patients treated for 24 hours or less. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients who met criteria were included. There were no relevant epidemiologic, clinical, or histopathologic differences between groups. Surgical-site infections as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria occurred in 25.8 percent. A risk factor-adjusted analysis by a prespecified multiple logistic regression model showed that 24 hours or less of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was not inferior to treatment for more than 24 hours. The upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval of the risk difference was 9.4 percent (below the prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 percent leading to statistical significance). Risk factors for a surgical-site infection included obesity and postoperative wound complications. CONCLUSIONS: The study found no association between short-course perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (≤24 hours) and an increased rate of postoperative surgical-site infection. This is of high clinical relevance because short-course treatment can help reduce side effects and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and prevent surgical-site infections as effectively as a prolonged perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis course.

Fomite-To-Fingertip Transfer Of Escherichia Coli During Sequential Surface Contacts With And Without Hospital Nitrile Gloves: A Modelling And Experimental Study,"Introduction: The transmission of microorganisms from contaminated surfaces to fingers is known to contribute to hospital acquired infections, but the transfer of microorganisms to fingers after multiple sequential surface contacts with and without hospital nitrile gloves remains unexplored. Objectives: To assess the effect of nitrile gloves on the viable concentration of Escherichia coli on fingertips after repeated contacts with inoculated plastic surfaces experimentally and mathematically. Methods: Coupons of laminate plastic, were inoculated with E. coli, allowed to dry and 35 participants touched these sequentially 8 times using either a bare or nitrile gloved finger. Fingers were swabbed, and colonies cultured for enumeration. A linear mixed effects model was used to examine the effect of gloves as well parameters involved in sampling. An Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method is used to estimate transfer efficiency for a single contact from the data to compare against distributions from literature. Results: Transfer was dependent on finger microbial loading and showed an oscillatory effect becoming negative after 5 contacts. Transfer efficiency for a single contact estimated using ABC, was higher with bare skin (69%, 95% CI=43-94%) than gloved hands (37%, CI=23-51%). Microbial load became statistically stable after four contacts for gloved hands and after six contacts with bare skin. Analysis through Oldham's method suggests that the initial amount transferred during the first contact only has a significant effect on finger loadings up to the fourth contact, after which there is no discernible effect. Use of gloves has a dominant effect over an individual's finger-to-fomite pressure and finger surface area (p<0.01). Conclusion: On average, gloves reduced loading by 4.7% (CI=-12%>21%) over un-gloved contacts. Highest stochasticity of loading is observed from the first to the second contact, leading to the conclusion that contact with a single contaminated surface may be more important than repeated contacts with equally contaminated surfaces.","King M.-F., Atedoghu K., López-García M., Hiwar W., Zhang N., Dancer S.J., Noakes C.J., Fletcher L.A.",10.1186/s13756-019-0567-6,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Curcuma Longa Rhizome Extract And Curcumin Reduce The Adhesion Of Acanthamoeba Triangularis Trophozoites And Cysts In Polystyrene Plastic Surface And Contact Lens,"Curcuma longa and Curcumin have been documented to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, including anti-Acanthamoeba activity. Hence, this study sought to explore the anti-adhesion activity of C. longa extract and Curcumin against Acanthamoeba triangularis trophozoites and cysts in plastic and contact lenses. Our results showed that C. longa extract and Curcumin significantly inhibited the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface, as investigated by the crystal violet assay (P < 0.05). Also, an 80–90% decrease in adhesion of trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface was detected following the treatment with C. longa extract and Curcumin at 1/2 × MIC, compared to the control. In the contact lens model, approximately 1 log cells/mL of the trophozoites and cysts was reduced when the cells were treated with Curcumin, when compared to the control. Pre-treatment of the plastic surface with Curcumin at 1/2-MIC reduced 60% and 90% of the adhesion of trophozoites and cysts, respectively. The reduction in 1 Log cells/mL of the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites was observed when lenses were pre-treated with both the extract and Curcumin. Base on the results obtained from this study, A. triangularis trophozoites treated with C. longa extract and Curcumin have lost strong acanthopodia, thorn-like projection pseudopodia observed by scanning electron microscope. This study also revealed the therapeutic potentials of C. longa extract and Curcumin, as such, have promising anti-adhesive potential that can be used in the management/prevention of A. triangularis adhesion to contact lenses.","Mitsuwan W., Sangkanu S., Romyasamit C., Kaewjai C., Jimoh T.O., De Lourdes Pereira M., Siyadatpanah A., Kayesth S., Nawaz M., Rahmatullah M., Butler M.S., Wilairatana P., Wiart C., Nissapatorn V.",10.1016/j.ijpddr.2020.11.001,International Journal For Parasitology: Drugs And Drug Resistance
Resveratrol Accelerates Wound Healing By Inducing M2 Macrophage Polarisation In Diabetic Mice,"Context: The reduction in M2 macrophage polarisation plays a major role during diabetic wound healing. Resveratrol (RSV) can promote the polarisation of M2 macrophages and accelerate diabetic wound healing. However, the specific mechanism by which RSV regulates M2 macrophage polarisation to promote diabetic wound healing is unclear. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of RSV on diabetic wound healing and analysed the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: STZ-induced C57/B6 mice were used as a diabetic mice model for a period of 15 days. RSV (10 μmol/L) was injected around the wound to evaluate the effect of RSV on the healing process of diabetic wounds. The human monocyte line THP-1 was used to evaluate the effects of RSV (10 μmol/L) on polarisation of M2 macrophages and the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Results: In vivo, RSV significantly increased diabetic wound healing (p < 0.05) and make the regenerated skin structure more complete. And it promoted the expression of α-SMA and Collagen I (p < 0.05). Moreover, RSV reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, iNOS and IL-1β) (p < 0.05) and promoted M2 macrophage polarisation by increasing Arg-1 and CD206 expression (p < 0.01). In vitro, RSV promoted the polarisation of M2 macrophages (p < 0.001) and reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) (p < 0.05). The therapeutic effects of RSV were all significantly reversed with LY294002 (p < 0.01). Discussion and conclusions: RSV has the positive effects on promoting the acceleration and quality of skin wound healing, which provides a scientific basis for clinical treatment in diabetic wound.","Ding Y., Yang P., Li S., Zhang H., Ding X., Tan Q.",10.1080/13880209.2022.2149821,Pharmaceutical Biology
Plug-And-Play In Vitro Metastasis System Toward Recapitulating The Metastatic Cascade,"Microfluidic-based tumor models that mimic tumor culture environment have been developed to understand the cancer metastasis mechanism and discover effective antimetastatic drugs. These models successfully recapitulated key steps of metastatic cascades, yet still limited to few metastatic steps, operation difficulty, and small molecule absorption. In this study, we developed a metastasis system made of biocompatible and drug resistance plastics to recapitulate each metastasis stage in three-dimensional (3D) mono- and co-cultures formats, enabling the investigation of the metastatic responses of cancer cells (A549-GFP). The plug-and-play feature enhances the efficiency of the experimental setup and avoids initial culture failures. The results demonstrate that cancer cells tended to proliferate and migrate with circulating flow and intravasated across the porous membrane after a period of 3 d when they were treated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) or co-cultured with human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). The cells were also observed to detach and migrate into the circulating flow after a period of 20 d, indicating that they transformed into circulating tumor cells for the next metastasis stage. We envision this metastasis system can provide novel insights that would aid in fully understanding the entire mechanism of tumor invasion.","Ni B.-S., Tzao C., Huang J.-H.",10.1038/s41598-019-54711-z,Scientific Reports
Mmp3C: An In-Silico Framework To Depict Cancer Metabolic Plasticity Using Gene Expression Profiles,"Metabolic plasticity enables cancer cells to meet divergent demands for tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance. Landscape analysis of tumor metabolic plasticity spanning different cancer types, in particular, metabolic crosstalk within cell subpopulations, remains scarce. Therefore, we proposed a new in-silico framework, termed as MMP3C (Modeling Metabolic Plasticity by Pathway Pairwise Comparison), to depict tumor metabolic plasticity based on transcriptome data. Next, we performed an extensive metabo-plastic analysis of over 6000 tumors comprising 13 cancer types. The metabolic plasticity within distinct cell subpopulations, particularly interplay with tumor microenvironment, were explored at single-cell resolution. Ultimately, the metabo-plastic events were screened out for multiple clinical applications via machine learning methods. The pilot research indicated that 6 out of 13 cancer types exhibited signs of the Warburg effect, implying its high reliability and robustness. Across 13 cancer types, high metabolic organized heterogeneity was found, and four metabo-plastic subtypes were determined, which link to distinct immune and metabolism patterns impacting prognosis. Moreover, MMP3C analysis of approximately 60 000 single cells of eight breast cancer patients unveiled several metabo-plastic events correlated to tumorigenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Notably, the metabolic features screened out by MMP3C are potential biomarkers for diagnosis, tumor classification and prognosis. MMP3C is a practical cross-platform tool to capture tumor metabolic plasticity, and our study unveiled a core set of metabo-plastic pairs among diverse cancer types, which provides bases toward improving response and overcoming resistance in cancer therapy.","Chen X., Deng M., Wang Z., Huang C.",10.1093/bib/bbad471,Briefings In Bioinformatics
Can Microplastics And Disinfectant Resistance Genes Pose Conceivable Threats To Water Disinfection Process?,"Microplastic pollution in the environment has aroused widespread concerns, however, the potential environmental risks caused by excessive use of disinfectants are still unknown. Disinfectants with doses below the threshold can enhance the communication of resistance genes in pathogenic microorganisms, promoting the development and spread of antimicrobial activity. Problematically, the intensification of microplastic pollution and the increase of disinfectant consumption will become a key driving force for the growth of disinfectant resistance bacteria (DRB) and disinfectant resistance genes (DRGs) in the environment. Disinfection plays a crucial role in ensuring water safety, however, the presence of microplastics and DRGs seriously disturb the water disinfection process. Microplastics can reduce the concentration of disinfectant in the local environment around microorganisms and improve their tolerance. Microorganisms can improve their resistance to disinfectants or generate resistance genes via phenotypic adaptation, gene mutations, and horizontal gene transfer. However, very limited information is available on the impact of DRB and DRGs on disinfection process. In this paper, the contribution of microplastics to the migration and transmission of DRGs was analyzed. The challenges posed by the presence of microplastics and DRGs on conventional disinfection were thoroughly discussed. The knowledge gaps faced by relevant current research and further research priorities have been proposed in order to provide a scientific basis in the future.","Shen M., Zhao Y., Liu S., Tao S., Li T., Long H.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167192,Science Of The Total Environment
A Fungal Avirulence Factor Encoded In A Highly Plastic Genomic Region Triggers Partial Resistance To Septoria Tritici Blotch,"Cultivar-strain specificity in the wheat-Zymoseptoria tritici pathosystem determines the infection outcome and is controlled by resistance genes on the host side, many of which have been identified. On the pathogen side, however, the molecular determinants of specificity remain largely unknown. We used genetic mapping, targeted gene disruption and allele swapping to characterise the recognition of the new avirulence factor Avr3D1. We then combined population genetic and comparative genomic analyses to characterise the evolutionary trajectory of Avr3D1. Avr3D1 is specifically recognised by wheat cultivars harbouring the Stb7 resistance gene, triggering a strong defence response without preventing pathogen infection and reproduction. Avr3D1 resides in a cluster of putative effector genes located in a genome region populated by independent transposable element insertions. The gene was present in all 132 investigated strains and is highly polymorphic, with 30 different protein variants identified. We demonstrated that specific amino acid substitutions in Avr3D1 led to evasion of recognition. These results demonstrate that quantitative resistance and gene-for-gene interactions are not mutually exclusive. Localising avirulence genes in highly plastic genomic regions probably facilitates accelerated evolution that enables escape from recognition by resistance proteins.","Meile L., Croll D., Brunner P.C., Plissonneau C., Hartmann F.E., Mcdonald B.A., Sánchez-Vallet A.",10.1111/nph.15180,The New Phytologist
The Role Of Topical Antibiotic Prophylaxis In Oculofacial Plastic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study,"Purpose: The usefulness of topical antibiotic prophylaxis for routine oculofacial plastic surgery is not well established. Given concerns such as contact dermatitis, antibiotic resistance, and healthcare costs in conjunction with a low baseline rate of surgical site infections, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of infection with and without the use of topical antibiotic prophylaxis. Design: Randomized, controlled, unmasked clinical trial. Participants: Adult patients undergoing routine periocular surgery without prior history of periocular surgical site infection, need for perioperative oral or parenteral antibiotics, or allergy to all study medications. Methods: Participants were randomized before surgery to receive either antibiotic or placebo (mineral oil and petrolatum-based) ointment after surgery. Outcomes were measured at the first postoperative visit. The 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to compare outcomes between groups. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infections. The secondary outcomes included stratification of infections by patient risk characteristics, incidence of allergic contact dermatitis, and incidence of wound complications. Results: Four hundred one participants were enrolled and randomized, and 13 participants did not proceed with surgery or were lost to follow-up. High-risk features for infection were identified in 24% of the placebo group and 21% of the antibiotic group. Surgical site infections were more common in the placebo group (2.7% vs. 0.0%; P = 0.025). The rate of contact dermatitis was similar (0.5% vs. 0.5%; P = 1.00), as was the rate of wound dehiscence (2.7% vs. 3.5%; P = 0.77). Among the placebo group, the incidence of infections in the low- and high-risk participants was 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively. Infections were treated with oral or topical antibiotics and resolved without complication, except in 1 patient who required 2 subsequent surgeries to address the sequelae. Conclusions: After routine oculofacial plastic surgery, patients treated with a topical antibiotic ointment showed a lower risk of surgical site infection compared with patients treated with a nonantibiotic ointment.","Ashraf D.C., Idowu O.O., Wang Q., Yeeun T., Copperman T.S., Tanaboonyawat S., Arnold B.F., Oldenburg C.E., Vagefi M.R., Kersten R.C.",10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.07.032,Ophthalmology
Povidone-Iodine Versus Antibiotic Irrigation In Breast Implant Surgery: Revival Of The Ideal Solution,"The use of povidone-iodine alone has been advocated by several authors who continued to utilize it for pocket irrigation despite the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s prohibition of 2000. However, in 2017, the FDA removed the ban against povidone-iodine use in breast augmentation. In the practice of breast augmentation, pocket irrigation with various solutions has been advocated in preventing infection and capsular contraction. However, debate continues regarding an ideal solution that is most efficacious and carries least side effects. Many studies have shown the superiority of povidone-iodine due to its broad antimicrobial spectrum, efficacy against biofilms, lack of resistance, and safe allergenic profile. Povidone-iodine is bactericidal against many multi-drug resistant organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Mycobacterium. In addition, povidone-iodine also has microbicidal activity against fungi, protozoa, spores, and viruses. Despite widespread clinical use and extensive testing, there have been no reports of increased tolerance or resistance to povidone-iodine in any laboratory-derived or clinical isolates to date. Meanwhile, antibiotic resistance is a growing obstacle, and virtually all Gram-negative bacteria are now resistant to bacitracin. We are pleased with the recent change in the FDA's standing on povidone-iodine use in breast implant procedures given its superior antiseptic property, excellent safety profile, lack of resistance, accessibility, and low cost.","Dang T., Yim N., Tummala S., Parsa A.A., Parsa F.D.",10.1016/j.bjps.2019.09.007,"Journal Of Plastic, Reconstructive And Aesthetic Surgery"
Changing Susceptibility Of Staphylococci In Patients With Implant-Based Breast Reconstructions: A Single-Center Experience,"Background and Objectives: Infections and capsular contractures remain unresolved issues in implant-based breast reconstruction. Capsular contractures are thought to be caused by the endogenous flora of the nipple duct. However, little is known about the antibiotic susceptibility of the microorganisms involved. This study aimed to evaluate the composition of endogenous breast flora and its antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with breast cancer. This study will aid in selecting a prophylactic antibiotic regimen for breast reconstruction surgery. Materials and Methods: We obtained bacteriologic swabs from the nipple intraoperatively in patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction following nipple-sparing mastectomy between January 2019 and August 2021. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed according to the isolated bacteriology. Statistical analysis was performed based on several patient variables to identify which factors influence the antibiotic resistance rate of endogenous flora. Results: A total of 125 of 220 patients had positive results, of which 106 had positive culture results for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CoNS). Among these 106 patients, 50 (47%) were found to have methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and 56 (53%) were found to have methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. The methicillin resistance rate in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (56.3%) was significantly higher (OR, 2.3; p = 0.039) than that in the non-neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (35.5%). Conclusions: Based on the results, demonstrating high and rising incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci of nipple endogenous flora in patients with breast cancer compared to the past, it is necessary to consider the selection of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infections and capsular contracture after implant-based breast reconstruction.","Kim H.Y., Yi H.-S., Park J.-J., In S.-K., Kim H.-I., Park J.-H., Lee W.-H., Kim Y.-S.",10.3390/medicina58081130,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
Superhydrophobic Tipped Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Device For The In Vivo Treatment Of Periodontitis Using A Wistar Rat Model,"Limited options exist for treatment of periodontitis; scaling and root planing (SRP) are not sufficient to eradicate P. gingivalis and the resulting inflammatory disease. Chlorhexidine (CHX), used as an adjuvant to SRP, may reduce bacterial loads but leads to pain and staining, while evidence for its efficacy is lacking. Antibiotics are effective but can lead to drug-resistance. The rising concern of antibiotic resistance limits the future use of this treatment approach. This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel superhydrophobic (SH) antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) device as an adjuvant to SRP for the treatment of periodontitis induced in a Wistar rat in vivo model relative to CHX. The SH-aPDT device comprises an SH silicone rubber strip coated with verteporfin photosensitizer (PS), sterilized, and secured onto a tapered plastic optical fiber tip connected to a red diode laser. The superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) strips were fabricated by using a novel soluble template method that creates a medical-grade elastomer with hierarchical surface roughness without the use of nanoparticles. Superhydrophobicity minimizes direct contact of the PS-coated surface with bacterial biofilms. Upon insertion of the device tip into the pocket and energizing the laser, the device generates singlet oxygen that effectively targets and eliminates bacteria within the periodontal pocket. SH-aPDT treatment using 125 J/cm2 of red light on three consecutive days reduced P. gingivalis significantly more than SRP-CHX controls (p < 0.05). Clinical parameters significantly improved (p < 0.05), and histology and stereometry results demonstrated SH-aPDT to be the most effective treatment for improving healing and reducing inflammation, with an increase in fibroblast cells and extracellular matrix and a reduction in vascularization, inflammatory cells, and COX-2 expression. The SH-aPDT approach resulted in complete disease clearance assessed 30 days after treatment initiation with significant reduction of the periodontal pocket and re-formation of the junctional epithelium at the enamel-cementum junction. PS isolation on a SH strip minimizes the potential for bacteria to develop resistance, where the treatment may be aided by the oxygen supply retained within the SH surface.","Tonon C.C., De Souza Rastelli A.N., Bodahandi C., Ghosh G., Hasan T., Xu Q., Greer A., Lyons A.M.",10.1021/acsami.3c12820,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Effects Of Combined Microplastics And Heavy Metals Pollution On Terrestrial Plants And Rhizosphere Environment: A Review,"Microplastics (MPs) can enter the soil environment through industry, agricultural production and daily life sources. Their interaction with heavy metals (HMs) poses a significant threat to a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural ones, thereby affecting crop quality and threatening human health. This review initially addresses the impact of single and combined contamination with MPs and HMs on soil environment, including changes in soil physicochemical properties, microbial community structure and diversity, fertility, enzyme activity and resistance genes, as well as alterations in heavy metal speciation. The article further explores the effects of this pollution on the growth characteristics of terrestrial plants, such as plant biomass, antioxidant systems, metabolites and photosynthesis. In general, the combined contaminants tend to significantly affect soil environment and terrestrial plant growth, i.e., the impact of combined contaminants on plants weight ranged from −87.5% to 4.55%. Similarities and differences in contamination impact levels stem from the variations in contaminant types, sizes and doses of contaminants and the specific plant growth environments. In addition, MPs can not only infiltrate plants directly, but also significantly affect the accumulation of HMs in terrestrial plants. The heavy metals concentration in plants under the treatment of MPs were 70.26%–36.80%. The co-occurrence of these two pollution types can pose a serious threat to crop productivity and safety. Finally, this study proposes suggestions for future research aiming to address current gaps in knowledge, raises awareness about the impact of combined MPs + HMs pollution on plant growth and eco-environmental security.","Xu L., Xie W., Dai H., Wei S., Skuza L., Li J., Shi C., Zhang L.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142107,Chemosphere

In Situ And Individual-Based Analysis Of The Influence Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Escherichia Coli Conjugative Gene Transfer At The Single-Cell Level,"The impact of microplastic particles of micro- and nanometer sizes on microbial horizontal gene transfer (HGT) remains a controversial topic. Existing studies rely on traditional approaches, which analyze population behavior, leading to conflicting conclusions and a limited understanding. The present study addressed these limitations by employing a novel microfluidic chamber system for in situ visualization and precise quantification of the effects of different concentrations of polystyrene (PS) microbeads on microbial HGT at the single-cell level. The statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in the division times of both the donor and recipient bacteria across different PS microbead concentrations. However, as the concentration of PS microbeads increased from 0 to 2000 mg L(-1), the average conjugation frequency of Escherichia coli decreased from 0.028 ± 0.015 to 0.004 ± 0.003. Our observations from the microfluidic experiments revealed that 500 nm PS microbeads created a barrier effect on bacterial conjugative transfer. The presence of microbeads resulted in reduced contact and interaction between the donor and recipient strains, thereby causing a decrease in the conjugation transfer frequency. These findings were validated by an individual-based modeling framework parameterized by the data from the individual-level microfluidic experiments. Overall, this study offers a fresh perspective and strategy for investigating the risks associated with the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes related to microplastics.","Liu L., Zhang Q.-H., Li R.-T.",10.1021/acs.est.3c05476,Environmental Science And Technology
Global Microplastics Pollution: A Bibliometric Analysis And Review On Research Trends And Hotspots In Agroecosystems,"The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural ecosystems poses a notable threat to dynamics of soil ecosystems, crop productivity, and global food security. MPs enter agricultural ecosystems from various sources and have considerable impacts on the physiochemical properties soil, soil organisms and microbial communities, and plants. However, the intensity of these impacts can vary with the size, shape, types, and the concentrations of MPs in the soil. Besides, MPs can enter food chain through consummation of crops grown on MPs polluted soils. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1636 publications on the effects of MPs on agricultural ecosystems from 2012 to May 2024. The results revealed a substantial increase in publications over the years, and China, the USA, Germany, and India have emerged as leading countries in this field of research. Social network analysis identified emerging trends and research hotspots. The latest burst keywords were contaminants, biochar, polyethylene microplastics, biodegradable microplastics, antibiotic resistance genes, and quantification. Furthermore, we have summarized the effects of MPs on various components of agricultural ecosystems. By integrating findings from diverse disciplinary perspectives, this study provides a valuable insight into the current knowledge landscape, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions to effectively tackle the intricate challenges associated with MPs pollution in agricultural environments.","Jamil A., Ahmad A., Irfan M., Hou X., Wang Y., Chen Z., Liu X.",10.1007/s10653-024-02274-y,Environmental Geochemistry And Health
Microenvironment-Driven Dynamic Heterogeneity And Phenotypic Plasticity As A Mechanism Of Melanoma Therapy Resistance,"Drug resistance constitutes a major challenge in designing melanoma therapies. Microenvironment-driven tumor heterogeneity and plasticity play a key role in this phenomenon. Melanoma is highly heterogeneous with diverse genomic alterations and expression of different biological markers. In addition, melanoma cells are highly plastic and capable of adapting quickly to changing microenvironmental conditions. These contribute to variations in therapy response and durability between individual melanoma patients. In response to changing microenvironmental conditions, like hypoxia and nutrient starvation, proliferative melanoma cells can switch to an invasive slow-cycling state. Cells in this state are more aggressive and metastatic, and show increased intrinsic drug resistance. During continuous treatment, slow-cycling cells are enriched within the tumor and give rise to a new proliferative subpopulation with increased drug resistance, by exerting their stem cell-like behavior and phenotypic plasticity. In melanoma, the proliferative and invasive states are defined by high and low microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression, respectively. It has been observed that in MITF(high) melanomas, inhibition of MITF increases the efficacy of targeted therapies and delays the acquisition of drug resistance. Contrarily, MITF is downregulated in melanomas with acquired drug resistance. According to the phenotype switching theory, the gene expression profile of the MITF(low) state is predominantly regulated by WNT5A, AXL, and NF-κB signaling. Thus, different combinations of therapies should be effective in treating different phases of melanoma, such as the combination of targeted therapies with inhibitors of MITF expression during the initial treatment phase, but with inhibitors of WNT5A/AXL/NF-κB signaling during relapse.","Ahmed F., Haass N.K.",10.3389/fonc.2018.00173,Frontiers In Oncology
Osseous Response On Linear And Cyclic Rgd-Peptides Immobilized On Titanium Surfaces In Vitro And In Vivo,"Biomimetic surface modifications of titanium (Ti) implants using the Arg-Gly-Asp-sequence (RGD) are promising to accelerate bone healing in cases of medical implants. Therefore, we compared the impact of linear and cyclic RGD (l- and c-RGD) covalently coupled onto Ti surfaces on the osseous response in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, osteoblasts’ behavior on different surfaces (unmodified, amino-silanized [APTES], l- and c-RGD) was analysed regarding adhesion (fluorescence microscopy), proliferation (resazurin stain) and differentiation (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). In vivo, osteosynthesis screws (unmodified n = 8, l-RGD n = 8, c-RGD n = 8) were inserted into the proximal tibiae of 12 rabbits and evaluated for bone growth parameters (bone implant contact [%] and vertical bone apposition [VBA;%]) at 3 and 6 weeks. In vitro, c- as well as l-RGD surfaces stimulated osteoblasts’ adherence, proliferation and differentiation in a similar manner, with only subtle evidence of superiority of the c-RGD modifications. In vivo, c-RGD-modifications led to a significantly increased VBA after 3 and 6 weeks. Thus, coating with c-RGD appears to play an important role influencing osteoblasts’ behaviour in vitro but especially in vivo. These findings can be applied prospectively to implantable biomaterials with hypothetically improved survival and success rates. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

Multiple Deep-Seated Dentofacial Abscesses Caused By Multidrug-Resistant Viridans Group Streptococci,"Odontogenic infections, generally caused by dental caries and periodontal disease, can result in fatal illness. We herein report a 71-year-old Japanese woman with type 2 diabetes and hemodialysis who suffered from multiple dentofacial abscesses mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus oralis. She complained of pain and swelling of her face, with an extraoral fistula from the left cheek. Following 3 surgical debridement procedures and partial mandibulectomy, in addition to 12 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, the multiple dentofacial abscesses were ameliorated. A combination of surgical and antimicrobial treatments following an early diagnosis is essential for reducing further complications.","Fukushima S., Hagiya H., Mizuta Y., Nakano Y., Takahara M., Okamoto K., Hayashi Y., Yamada K., Hasegawa K., Otsuka F.",10.2169/internalmedicine.4283-20,Internal Medicine
Evaluation Of Dental Pulp Stem Cell Heterogeneity And Behaviour In 3D Type I Collagen Gels,"Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are increasingly being advocated for regenerative medicine-based therapies. However, significant heterogeneity in the genotypic/phenotypic properties of DPSC subpopulations exist, influencing their therapeutic potentials. As most studies have established DPSC heterogeneity using 2D culture approaches, we investigated whether heterogeneous DPSC proliferative and contraction/remodelling capabilities were further evident within 3D type I collagen gels in vitro. DPSC subpopulations were isolated from human third molars and identified as high/low proliferative and multipotent/unipotent, following in vitro culture expansion and population doubling (PD) analysis. High proliferative/multipotent DPSCs, such as A3 (30 PDs and 80 PDs), and low proliferative/unipotent DPSCs, such as A1 (17 PDs), were cultured in collagen gels for 12 days, either attached or detached from the surrounding culture plastic. Collagen architecture and high proliferative/multipotent DPSC morphologies were visualised by Scanning Electron Microscopy and FITC-phalloidin/Fluorescence Microscopy. DPSC proliferation (cell counts), contraction (% diameter reductions), and remodelling (MMP-2/MMP-9 gelatin zymography) of collagen gels were also evaluated. Unexpectedly, no proliferation differences existed between DPSCs, A3 (30 PDs) and A1 (17 PDs), although A3 (80 PDs) responses were significantly reduced. Despite rapid detached collagen gel contraction with A3 (30 PDs), similar contraction rates were determined with A1 (17 PDs), although A3 (80 PDs) contraction was significantly impaired. Gel contraction correlated to distinct gelatinase profiles. A3 (30 PDs) possessed superior MMP-9 and comparable MMP-2 activities to A1 (17 PDs), whereas A3 (80 PDs) had significantly reduced MMP-2/MMP-9. High proliferative/multipotent DPSCs, A3 (30 PDs), further exhibited fibroblast-like morphologies becoming polygonal within attached gels, whilst losing cytoskeletal organization and fibroblastic morphologies in detached gels. This study demonstrates that heterogeneity exists in the gel contraction and MMP expression/activity capabilities of DPSCs, potentially reflecting differences in their abilities to degrade biomaterial scaffolds and regulate cellular functions in 3D environments and their regenerative properties overall. Thus, such findings enhance our understanding of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics associated with high proliferative/multipotent DPSCs.","Alraies A., Waddington R.J., Sloan A.J., Moseley R.",10.1155/2020/3034727,Biomed Research International
Monoclonal Antibody 2C5-Modified Mixed Dendrimer Micelles For Tumor-Targeted Codelivery Of Chemotherapeutics And Sirna,"Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumors has the potential to reach a high dose at the tumor while minimizing systemic exposure. Incorporation of antibody within a micellar platform represents a drug delivery system for tumor-targeted delivery of antitumor agents. Such modified immunomicelles can result in an increased accumulation of antitumor agents and enhanced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Here, mixed dendrimer micelles (MDM) composed of PEG(2k)-DOPE-conjugated generation 4 polyamidoamine dendrimer G4-PAMAM-PEG(2k)-DOPE and PEG(5k)-DOPE were coloaded with doxorubicin and siMDR-1. This formulation was further modified with monoclonal antibodies 2C5 with nucleosome-restricted specificity that effectively recognized cancer cells via the cell-surface-bound nucleosomes. Micelles with attached 2C5 antibodies significantly enhanced cellular association and tumor killing in both monolayer and spheroid tumor models as well as in vivo in experimental animals compared to the nontargeted formulations.","Pan J., Attia S.A., Subhan M.A., Filipczak N., Mendes L.P., Li X., Kishan Yalamarty S.S., Torchilin V.P.",10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00075,Molecular Pharmaceutics
Pediatric Microsurgery In The Reconstruction Of Complex Posttraumatic Foot And Ankle Defects: A Long-Term Follow-Up With A Comprehensive Review Of The Literature,"Background Lower limb reconstruction is a well-recognized challenge to the trauma or plastic surgeon. Although techniques and outcomes in the adult population are well documented, they are less so in the pediatric population. Here, we present our experience in the management of posttraumatic foot and ankle defects with free tissue transfer in children. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 3 and 16 from 2008 to 2016 who underwent foot and ankle soft tissue reconstruction. Any patient who underwent reconstruction for any reason other than trauma was excluded. Data were collected on operative time, free tissue transfer type, use of vein grafts, length of hospital stay, and postoperative morbidity. Also, a comprehensive systematic literature review was completed according to the PRISMA protocol for all previous reports of foot and ankle reconstruction in the young age group with free tissue transfer. Results Of our 40 patients, 23 were males and 12 females, free tissue transfer was used to reconstruct primarily the dorsum (71%), heel (11%), medial (9%), and lateral (3%) aspect of the foot. The anterior tibial artery was the predominant recipient vessel for anastomosis (77%). Mean inpatient stay was 9 days and our complication rate was 20%, primarily of superficial infection treated with antibiotic therapy. The review of the literature articles is completely analyzed in detail. Conclusion The need for durable coverage of exposed joints, tendons, fractures, or hardware makes the free flap particularly well suited to trauma reconstruction of the foot and ankle. The lack of underlying vascular disease in this patient group allows for low complication rates. Our study evidences the safety and positive long-term outcomes of free tissue transfer for the reconstruction of huge sized-soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle in children.","Elbatawy A., Elgammal M., Zayid T., Hamdy A., Ouf M.O., Ismail H., Sholkamy K., Malik M., Zidan S.M., Ayad W.",10.1055/s-0040-1714429,Journal Of Reconstructive Microsurgery
Simultaneous Treatment Of Pseudo-Gynecomastia And Lateral Chest In Patients With Massive Weight Loss,"BACKGROUND: Pseudogynecomastia in MWL patients is characterized by excess skin in chest, lateral chest, axilla and upper abdomen without enlargement of the breast glandular component. The aim of this work was to study long-term aesthetic outcomes of correction of severe pseudogynecomastia post-weight loss with inferior pedicle technique with some refinements. METHODOLOGY: This prospective study included 15 patients underwent chest contouring after massive weight loss within period of 2 years between January 2022 and January 2024. All patients were subjected to local examination (position of nipple-areola complex and degree of ptosis and chest anthropometry) and photographic assessment, and pre- and postoperative results were compared. Patient satisfaction survey was done. RESULTS: The ages ranged from 20 to 45 years (mean 32.67 years), the previous weight ranged with mean 158.8, the mean current weight was 87.53, and the mean BMI was 28.49. The time of weight loss ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean 20.07 months), and the duration of weight stability ranged from 6 to 24 months with mean 10.0 months. Regarding the complications, no major complications required readmission, four patients had minor complications (26.7%), one (6.7%) case had asymmetry of the NAC, one (6.7%) case had minor hematoma, one (6.7%) case had seroma, and one (6.7%) case had partial wound dehiscence. The overall satisfaction rate was high. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with male chest contouring for pseudogynecomastia following significant weight loss is excellent. In this study, we provide a reliable technique for management of pseudogynecomastia in post-MWL with good outcomes.

Functional Outcomes Of Cubital Tunnel Release In Patients With Negative Electrodiagnostic Studies,"BACKGROUND: Cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS) is the second most common compression neuropathy of the upper extremity. Electrodiagnostic studies (EDSs) are often used to confirm diagnosis. However, negative EDSs can present a difficult clinical challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional outcomes and symptom improvement for patients with a clinical diagnosis of CuTS, but with negative EDSs, who are treated surgically. METHODS: Patients who had EDSs before ulnar nerve surgery were identified by means of database search. Chart review was performed on 867 cases to identify those with negative EDSs. Twenty-five ulnar nerve operations in 23 patients were included in analysis. Chart review was performed to record preoperative and postoperative symptoms, physical examination findings, and outcome measures (ie, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and the Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation). RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 20.7 ± 14.9 months, 15 of 25 cases (60.0%) had complete resolution of all preoperative symptoms. All 10 patients who had residual symptoms endorsed improvement in their preoperative complaints. The median preoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 40.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 23.9 to 58.0], which significantly decreased to a median of 6.8 (IQR, 0 to 22.7) at final follow-up ( P < 0.01). The median postoperative Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation score was 9.5 (IQR, 1.5 to 19.5). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CuTS and normal EDSs treated surgically can be expected to have favorable outcomes with respect to symptoms and improvement in functional outcome scores. After ruling out confounding diagnoses, the authors continue to offer surgical intervention for these patients when nonoperative treatment has failed.

The Use Of Compound Muscle Action Potentials (Cmap) For Postoperative Monitoring Of Free Functioning Gracilis Muscle Transfer: A Preliminary Report,"Background and purposes The use of skin flap as a monitoring tool cannot sensitively reflect the vascularity of a functioning free muscle transfer (FFMT), and it may result in delayed detection of vascular compromise. We report the use of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) as a supplemental method in the monitoring of free gracilis transfers. Subjects and methods In 46 successful free gracilis transfers in 23 patients following total brachial plexus injury (BPI), CMAPs were measured every hour for 75 h postoperatively. We analyzed the amplitude, latency, and duration to understand the Wallerian degeneration effect and thresholds to warn vascular compromise clinically. After the primary study, we applied CMAP monitoring for 23 clinical cases. Main findings Three basic wave patterns of the CMAPs with or without dispersion were recognized. Forty-two CMAPs were successfully traced and 27 CMAPs with one constant wave pattern showed two types of amplitude and latency changes; positive and negative Wallerian degeneration. The mean 1-h maximal decreases of amplitudes and elongation of latency were 36% and 77%, respectively; however, they returned to the original pattern within 1 h. There were no significant differences of reinnervation time and final strength of elbow flexion between these 46 muscle transfers. In the clinical series, we experienced two cases of vascular compromise that showed CMAP critical alterations without skin flap changes. Conclusions Our preliminary results show that the measurement of CMAPs has great potential for the sensitive and reliable monitoring of muscle circulation after FFMT. The clinical critical values of CMAP amplitude changes for vascular compromise are >40% sudden decrease, and they continued to decrease further. This technique is most useful for postoperative vascular monitoring of a buried muscle flap, and it is proven to be of clinical significance in current vascular compromised cases.

Fate Of Biodegradable Engineered Nanoparticles Used In Veterinary Medicine As Delivery Systems From A One Health Perspective,"The field of veterinary medicine needs new solutions to address the current challenges of antibiotic resistance and the need for increased animal production. In response, a multitude of delivery systems have been developed in the last 20 years in the form of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), a subclass of which are polymeric, biodegradable ENPs, that are biocompatible and biodegradable (pbENPs). These platforms have been developed to deliver cargo, such as antibiotics, vaccines, and hormones, and in general, have been shown to be beneficial in many regards, particularly when comparing the efficacy of the delivered drugs to that of the conventional drug applications. However, the fate of pbENPs developed for veterinary applications is poorly understood. pbENPs undergo biotransformation as they are transferred from one ecosystem to another, and these transformations greatly affect their impact on health and the environment. This review addresses nanoparticle fate and impact on animals, the environment, and humans from a One Health perspective.","Cerbu C., Kah M., White J.C., Astete C.E., Sabliov C.M.",10.3390/molecules26030523,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)"
Cold Atmospheric Plasma Is A Viable Solution For Treating Orthopedic Infection: A Review,"Bacterial infection and antibiotic resistance are major threats to human health and very few solutions are available to combat this eventuality. A growing number of studies indicate that cold (non-thermal) plasma treatment can be used to prevent or eliminate infection from bacteria, bacterial biofilms, fungi and viruses. Mechanistically, a cold plasma discharge is composed of highenergy electrons that generate short-lived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which further react to form more stable compounds (NO2, H2O2, NH2Cl and others) depending on the gas mixture and plasma parameters. Cold plasma devices are being developed for medical applications including infection, cancer, plastic surgery applications and more. Thus, in this review we explore the potential utility of cold plasma as a non-antibiotic approach for treating post-surgical orthopedic infections.","Nguyen L., Lu P., Boehm D., Bourke P., Gilmore B.F., Hickok N.J., Freeman T.A.",10.1515/hsz-2018-0235,Biological Chemistry

Decreasing The Risk Of Health-Care Associated Legionellosis Requires Joint Efforts And Close Collaboration Between All Relevant Functions In A Hospital,"Introduction: Between 2005 and 2009 15 patients acquired legionellosis from the water system at Uppsala University Hospital (UUH), some fatal. Several control measures has been descibed with more or less effectiveness (1). Objectives: To highlight the importance of a water saftey plan with defined roles, responsibilities and ways of communication between all functions can reduce the risk of health-care associated legionellosis. Methods: During 2010 the hospital adopted the WHO water safety plan which included defining roles, responibilities and ways of communications between all relevant functions (2). A steering group chaired by the chief physicia, engineers, janitors, the clinical microbiology laboratory and infection prevention and control staff met regularly. The water safety plan included monitoring the water system twice yearly and defining action limits. Control measures included weekly flushing of taps, plugging dead ends, point-of-use filters in some wards, adjusting cold and warm water temperatures and replacing plastic waterlines with copper. Clear action plans were set up, documented and followed up in regular meetings. Results: Between the years 2010-2017 three patients acquired legionellosis at UUH and all cases could be clearly explained by all functions of the steering group. The first case in 2012 acquired legionellosis from a dental unit which has been described in a recently published casereport (3). All three cases have been reported to the Swedish Social Care Inspectorate and carefully followed up to prevent new cases. Conclusion: When a clear water safety plan was established at UUH the risk of acquiring legionellosis from the hospital water system dramatically decreased. The decisions to take on preventable actions were shared between all functions with different knowledge in order to control the risks that continuously developed over time.",Lytsy B.,10.1186/s13756-017-0201-4,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Bile Salt Exposure Alters The Growth And Pathogenicity Of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"Background:Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, and most patients are effectively colonized with this organism by late adolescence. Pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is implicated in an increased frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, and with the development of bronchiectasis and decline in pulmonary function. The presence of bile salts in the lungs is a common finding in patients with CF, and is related to chronic gastroesophageal reflux and micro-aspiration in the context of relative gastrointestinal dysmotility and an increased frequency of pyloric sphincter relaxation. Bile salts have recently been shown to induce up-regulation of genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa related to chronic lifestyles, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance; and the presence of bile salts in the lung is associated with decreased pulmonary function and with increased inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Reen FJ, et al. Sci Rep 2016;6:29768; Pauwels A, et al. Chest 2012;141:1568-74). Objective: We hypothesize that exposure to bile salts drives Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a less acutely virulent, biofilm-oriented lifestyle, and that this change may contribute to the recalcitrant nature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in CF lung. We sought to characterize potential bile salt induced changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa behavior. Methods: The Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 was grown in either tryptic soy broth (TSB) or TSB with 0.4% bile salts (weight / volume) added to reflect a concentration which is present physiologically. Comparison was also made to infection with fliC, a flagellin-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant, and an intestinal commensal E. coli strain. Using human respiratory epithelial cultures, we explored whether exposure to bile salts impacted bacterial association with epithelial cells or bacterial induced neutrophil trans-epithelial migration in a co-culture assay. Further, we studied the effects of bile salts on bacterial growth, biofilm formation, and antibiotic tolerance. Results: Bacterial association with epithelial cells was significantly decreased in the bile salt exposed PA14, but not with E. coli. PA14 biofilm formation was increased in the bile salt treated group. Growth curves of PA14 yielded intriguing findings suggesting differential growth in planktonic PA14 in the presence of bile salts, possibly associated with the level of oxygenation. Conclusions: Exposure to a bile salts mixture results in decreased association of PA14 to human airway epithelium-derived cell layers, and increases biofilm formation to a plastic surface. Bile exposure is thought to induce chronic lifestyle phenotypes and decreased virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and so this observation may reflect down-regulation of bacterial adhesins and virulence genes. Moving forward, our lab will explore further bile salt mediated effects on the host / pathogen relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the human airway.","Gipson K., Eaton A., Hibbler R., Yonker L.M., Faherty C., Hurley B.",10.1002/ppul.23840,Pediatric Pulmonology
Latest Knowledge About Changes In The Proteome In Microgravity,"Introduction: A long-term stay of humans in space causes health problems and changes in protists and plants. Deep space exploration will increase the time humans or rodents will spend in microgravity (µg). Moreover, they are exposed to cosmic radiation, hypodynamia, and isolation. OMICS investigations will increase our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of µg-induced alterations in vivo and in vitro. Areas covered: We summarize the findings over the recent 3 years on µg-induced changes in the proteome of protists, plants, rodent, and human cells. Considering the thematic orientation of microgravity-related publications in that time frame, we focus on medicine-associated findings, such as the µg-induced antibiotic resistance of bacteria, the myocardial consequences of µg-induced calpain activation, and the role of MMP13 in osteoarthritis. All these point to the fact that µg is an extreme stressor that could not be evolutionarily addressed on Earth. Expert opinion: In conclusion, when interpreting µg-experiments, the direct, mostly unspecific stress response, must be distinguished from specific µg-effects. For this reason, recent studies often do not consider single protein findings but place them in the context of protein–protein interactions. This enables an estimation of functional relationships, especially if these are supported by epigenetic and transcriptional data (multi-omics).","Schulz H., Strauch S.M., Richter P., Wehland M., Krüger M., Sahana J., Corydon T.J., Wise P., Baran R., Lebert M., Grimm D.",10.1080/14789450.2022.2030711,Expert Review Of Proteomics
Helicobacter Pylori Antibiotic Resistance Profile In Chinese Children With Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms And A Literature Review For Developing Personalized Eradicating Strategies,"Background: H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) infections typically occur in early childhood. Although the prevalence of H. pylori in children is lower than that in adults, the eradication rate of this infection in children is relatively low because of resistance. In this study, we analyzed personalized treatment strategies to achieve treatment goals based on H. pylori resistance characteristics. This retrospective single-center study was conducted between January 2019 and December 2022 and enrolled 1,587 children who presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and underwent endoscopy. H. pylori culturing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed. Results: Culture-positive results for H. pylori were obtained in 535 children. The resistance rates to clarithromycin (CLA), metronidazole (MET), and levofloxacin (LEV) were 39.8%, 78.1%, and 20.2%, respectively. None of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline (TET), amoxicillin (AMO), or furazolidone (FZD). Double resistance rates to CLA + MET, CLA + LEV, and MET + LEV were 19.1%, 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively. Notably, triple-resistant to CLA + MET + LEV was 9.7%. Based on susceptibility tests, individualized triple therapy [proton pump inhibitor (PPI) +AMO + CLA/MET] was selected for 380 children with H. pylori sensitive to MET and/or CLA. In 155 children resistant to CLA and MET, bismuth-based quadruple therapy was recommended; for unable to receive bismuth, concomitant therapy was recommended for 14 children (<8 years of age); triple therapy with TET was recommended for 141 children (>8 years of age), with 43 children (>14 years of age) requiring FZD rather than TET. Conclusion: Resistance to H. pylori in Chinese children was relatively poor. Personalized therapy regimens should be based on susceptibility tests and avoided factors associated with treatment failure.","Zhou D., Wang W., Gu L., Han M., Hao W., Huang J., Lin Q., Wang Y.",10.3389/fphar.2024.1392787,Frontiers In Pharmacology
Nuclear Trapping Through Inhibition Of Exosomal Export By Indomethacin Increases Cytostatic Efficacy Of Doxorubicin And Pixantrone,"Purpose: Although R-CHOP-based immunochemotherapy cures significant proportions of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, tumor cell susceptibility to chemotherapy varies, with mostly fatal outcome in cases of resistant disease. We and others have shown before that export of cytostatic drugs contributes to drug resistance. Now we provide a novel approach to overcome exosome-mediated drug resistance in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Experimental Design: We used well-established centrifugation protocols to purify exosomes from DLBCL cell lines and detected anthracyclines using FACS and HPLC. We used shRNA knockdown of ABCA3 to determine ABCA3 dependence of chemotherapy susceptibility and monitored ABCA3 expression after indomethacin treatment using qPCR. Finally, we established an in vivo assay using a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay to determine the synergy of anthracycline and indomethacin treatment. Results: We show increased efficacy of the anthracycline doxorubicin and the anthracenedione pixantrone by suppression of exosomal drug resistance with indomethacin. B-cell lymphoma cells in vitro efficiently extruded doxorubicin and pixantrone, in part compacted in exosomes. Exosomal biogenesis was critically dependent on the expression of the ATP-transporter A3 (ABCA3). Genetic or chemical depletion of ABCA3 augmented intracellular retention of both drugs and shifted the subcellular drug accumulation to prolonged nuclear retention. Indomethacin increased the cytostatic efficacy of both drugs against DLBCL cell lines in vitro and in vivo in a CAM assay. Conclusions: We propose pretreatment with indomethacin toward enhanced antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines and anthracenediones.","Koch R., Aung T., Vogel D., Chapuy B., Wenzel D., Becker S., Sinzig U., Venkataramani V., Von Mach T., Jacob R., Truemper L., Wulf G.G.",10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0577,Clinical Cancer Research
High-Specificity Synthesis Of Novel Monomers By Remodeled Alcohol Hydroxylase,"Background: Diols are important monomers for the production of plastics and polyurethanes, which are widely used in our daily life. The medium-chain diols with one hydroxyl group at its subterminal end are able to confer more flexibility upon the synthesized materials. But unfortunately, this type of diols has not been synthesized so far. The strong need for advanced materials impelled us to develop a new strategy for the production of these novel diols. In this study, we use the remodeled P450(BM3) for high-specificity production of 1,7-decanediol. Results: The native P450(BM3) was capable of converting medium-chain alcohols into corresponding α, ω1-, α, ω2- and α, ω3-diols, with each of them accounting for about one third of the total diols, but it exhibited a little or no activity on the short-chain alcohols. Greatly improved regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation was obtained by laboratory evolution of P450(BM3). After substitution of 12 amino acid residues (J2-F87A), the ratio of 1,7-decanediol (ω-3 hydroxylation) to total decanediols increased to 86.8 % from 34.0 %. Structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the heme end residues such as Ala(78), Phe(87) and Arg(255) play a key role in controlling the regioselectivity of the alcohol hydroxylation, while the residues at the mouth of substrate binding site is not responsible for the regioselectivity. Conclusions: Herein we employ an engineered P450(BM3) for the first time to enable the high-specificity biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, which is a promising monomer for the development of advanced materials. Several key amino acid residues that control the regioselectivity of alcohol hydroxylation were identified, providing some new insights into how to improve the regiospecificity of alcohol hydroxylation. This report not only provides a good strategy for the biosynthesis of 1,7-decanediol, but also gives a promising approach for the production of other useful diols.","Zheng Y., Li L., Liu Q., Zhang H., Cao Y., Xian M., Liu H.",10.1186/s12896-016-0291-8,Bmc Biotechnology
Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity For Photo-Immunologic Therapy Of Postoperative Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection And Secondary Recurrence,"The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra-micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress-related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection-related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.","Tang H., Qu X., Zhang W., Chen X., Zhang S., Xu Y., Yang H., Wang Y., Yang J., Yuan W.-E., Yue B.",10.1002/adma.202107300,"Advanced Materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"
Antibiotic Prophylaxis After Immediate Breast Reconstruction: The Reality Of Its Efficacy,"METHODS: Using Truven MarketScan databases, the authors identified all patients who underwent immediate implant reconstruction between January of 2010 and June of 2014 with at least 6 months of follow-up. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as any oral antibiotic course to be taken postoperatively based on prescriptions filled within 14 days preoperatively through 24 hours after discharge. Reconstructive failure, defined as explantation because of infection, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes of interest included wound complications, infection, and readmission for infection. Multivariable regression analyses controlled for demographic variables/comorbidities.BACKGROUND: Numerous techniques are used to prevent infection after immediate implant-based breast reconstruction. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly prescribed to decrease the risk of reconstructive failure, despite conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness. The authors studied whether postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of infection-related explantation in the setting of immediate prosthesis-based breast reconstruction.RESULTS: Of the 7443 patients, 6049 (81 percent) filled prescriptions for postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. These patients were equally likely to develop a wound complication (OR, 0.93; 95 percent CI, 0.71 to 1.23) or infection (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.70 to 1.14), undergo explantation because of infection (OR, 0.82; 95 percent CI, 0.57 to 1.18), or require readmission for infection (OR, 1.21; 95 percent CI, 0.82 to 1.78) compared with those who did not receive antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the risk of infection-related outcomes based on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis duration.CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was not associated with a reduced risk of infection or explantation following prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. Given rising rates of antibiotic resistance, focusing instead on technical considerations and the management of comorbid conditions may more effectively enhance the safety of breast reconstruction.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.","Ranganathan K., Sears E.D., Zhong L., Chung T.-T., Chung K.C., Kozlow J.H., Momoh A.O., Waljee J.F.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000004204,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Secondary Resistance To Vismodegib After Initial Successful Treatment Of Extensive Recurrent Periocular Basal Cell Carcinoma With Orbital Invasion,"Vismodegib is proven to be effective in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma, but evidence of resistance is beginning to emerge. A case of advanced recurrent periocular basal cell carcinoma which responded dramatically to vismodegib after 3 months but recurred after 9 months due to drug resistance, eventually requiring orbital exenteration, is presented. The mechanism of vismodegib resistance is discussed.","Papastefanou V.P., René C.",10.1097/IOP.0000000000000565,Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
"Source, Occurrence, Migration And Potential Environmental Risk Of Microplastics In Sewage Sludge And During Sludge Amendment To Soil","Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global pollutant. MPs research is mainly concentrated on water, with limited research on MPs in sewage sludge. MPs from various sources are collected into sewage and most of the MPs are trapped in the sludge during the sewage treatment process. Sludge is not only a sink of MPs, but also a source. Soil amendment with sludge provides nutrients into the soil, but it can also import substantial MPs into the soil, which has certain environmental risks. Therefore, we focused on the MPs in sludge and sludge-amended soil and conducted a literature review to summarize the sources, physical properties and fate of the MPs in sludge, as well as their separation, identification and statistical methods. MPs can accumulate in the soil, influence the properties of the soil, and also migrate, which might result in the pollution of deep soils and groundwater. In addition, the adsorption by MPs of heavy metals, organic pollutants, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes cannot be ignored as sewage sludge generally contains substantial concentrations of these pollutants. They can be adsorbed by the MPs and transferred into the soil with sludge amendment of soil. The combination and interaction of MPs with its adsorbed pollutants might increase environmental risk, further leading to possibility of them being uptaken by plants. The specific long-term risks to the environment caused by MPs in soil with sludge amendment require further exploration and investigation.","Gao D., Li X.-Y., Liu H.-T.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140355,Science Of The Total Environment
Plasticity Of The Leishmania Genome Leading To Gene Copy Number Variations And Drug Resistance,"Leishmania has a plastic genome, and drug pressure can select for gene copy number variation (CNV). CNVs can apply either to whole chromosomes, leading to aneuploidy, or to specific genomic regions. For the latter, the amplification of chromosomal regions occurs at the level of homologous direct or inverted repeated sequences leading to extrachromosomal circular or linear amplified DNAs. This ability of Leishmania to respond to drug pressure by CNVs has led to the development of genomic screens such as Cos-Seq, which has the potential of expediting the discovery of drug targets for novel promising drug candidates.","Papadopoulou B., Ouellette M., Laffitte M.-C., Leprohon P.",10.12688/f1000research.9218.1,F1000Research
Garlic Stalk Waste And Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Mitigate Challenges In Continuously Monocropping Eggplant Obstacles By Modulating Physiochemical Properties And Fungal Community Structure,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Continuous vegetable production under plastic tunnels faces challenges like soil degradation, increased soil-borne pathogens, and diminished eggplant yield. These factors collectively threaten the long-term sustainability of food security by diminishing the productivity and resilience of agricultural soils. This research examined the use of raw garlic stalk (RGS) waste and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a sustainable solution for these issues in eggplant monoculture. We hypothesized that the combined application of RGS waste and AMF would improve soil physicochemical properties compared to untreated soil in eggplant monoculture. The combined use of RGS and AMF was expected to suppress soil-borne pathogens, increase the abundance of soil beneficial microorganisms and alter fungal community structure. The combined application of RGS and AMF will significantly enhance eggplant yield compared to untreated plots. This study aimed to determine whether AMF and RGS, individually or in combination, can ameliorate the adverse effects of monoculture on eggplant soil. We also investigated whether these treatments could enhance eggplant yield. METHODS: The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with four treatments: AMF, RGS, and a combined treatment of AMF + RGS (ARGS), along with a control. Each treatment was replicated three times, Eggplant seedlings inoculated with AMF and treated with RGS amendments, both individually and combined. The effects on root traits, soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activity, and fungal community structure were investigated. RESULTS: RGS amendments and AMF inoculation improved root length, volume, and mycorrhizal colonization. The combined treatment showed the most significant improvement. RGS and AMF application increased soil nutrient availability (N, P, K) and organic matter content. Enzyme activities also increased with RGS and AMF treatments, with the combined application showing the highest activity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) increased, while soil pH decreased with RGS and AMF amendments. Sequencing revealed a shift in the fungal community structure. Ascomycota abundance decreased, while Basidiomycota abundance increased with RGS and AMF application. The combined treatment reduced the abundance of pathogenic genera (Fusarium) and enriched beneficial taxa (Chaetomium, Coprinellus, Aspergillus). Pearson correlations supported the hypothesis that soil physicochemical properties influence fungal community composition. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of co-applying RGS and AMF in continuous cropping systems. It enhances soil physicochemical properties, reduces soil-borne pathogens, and promotes beneficial microbial communities and eggplant yield. This combined approach offers a sustainable strategy to address the challenges associated with eggplant monoculture under plastic tunnels.","Cao Y., Ghani M.I., Ahmad N., Bibi N., Ghafoor A., Liu J., Gou J., Zou X.",10.1186/s12870-024-05710-4,Bmc Plant Biology
Combined Effects Of Nanosized Polystyrene And Erythromycin On Bacterial Growth And Resistance Mutations In Escherichia Coli,"Toxicological effects of nanoplastics have been demonstrated in a variety of organisms, yet their impacts on bacteria, especially on the antibiotic resistance evolution remain under explored. Herein, we report individual and combined effects of nano-polystyrene (nano-PS) and erythromycin (ERY) on growth and resistance mutations of Escherichia coli. The toxicity of nano-PS was dependent on size and functional modifications, with 30 nm and amino-modified PS (PS-NH(2), 200 nm) showing the greatest toxicity. Adsorption of nano-PS onto bacterial surface and the subsequent increase of intracellular ROS or the probable mechanical damage were considered as the primary toxic mechanisms. Furthermore, nano-PS increased the bacterial resistance mutations, which was due to the oxidative damage to DNA and the SOS response. In addition, PS-NH(2) presented synergistic effects with ERY while non-modified PS had no impact, although both of them showed adsorption capacity to ERY. This was likely because the positively charged PS-NH(2) acted as a carrier of ERY and enhanced the interactions between ERY and the bacteria. Our findings raised the concerns about the risk of nanoplastics in accelerating the bacterial resistance evolution, and highlighted the necessity of including combined effects of nanoplastics and co-contaminants in risk assessment.","Ning Q., Wang D., An J., Ding Q., Huang Z., Zou Y., Wu F., You J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126858,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Tricks And Tracks Of Prevalence, Occurrences, Treatment Technologies, And Challenges Of Mixtures Of Emerging Contaminants In The Environment: With Special Emphasis On Microplastic","This paper aims to emphasize the occurrence of various emerging contaminant (EC) mixtures in natural ecosystems and highlights the primary concern arising from the unregulated release into soil and water, along with their impacts on human health. Emerging contaminant mixtures, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, antibiotics, biocides, surfactants, phthalates, enteric viruses, and microplastics (MPs), are considered toxic contaminants with grave implications. MPs play a crucial role in transporting pollutants to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as they interact with the various components of the soil and water environments. This review summarizes that major emerging contaminants (ECs), like trimethoprim, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, and 17α-Ethinylestradiol, pose serious threats to public health and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In addressing human health concerns and remediation techniques, this review critically evaluates conventional methods for removing ECs from complex matrices. The diverse physiochemical properties of surrounding environments facilitate the partitioning of ECs into sediments and other organic phases, resulting in carcinogenic, teratogenic, and estrogenic effects through active catalytic interactions and mechanisms mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors. The proactive toxicity of ECs mixture complexation and, in part, the yet-to-be-identified environmental mixtures of ECs represent a blind spot in current literature, necessitating conceptual frameworks for assessing the toxicity and risks with individual components and mixtures. Lastly, this review concludes with an in-depth exploration of future scopes, knowledge gaps, and challenges, emphasizing the need for a concerted effort in managing ECs and other organic pollutants.","Sudarsan J.S., Dogra K., Kumar R., Raval N.P., Leifels M., Mukherjee S., Trivedi M.H., Jain M.S., Zang J., Barceló D., Mahlknecht J., Kumar M.",10.1016/j.jconhyd.2024.104389,Journal Of Contaminant Hydrology
The Guardian Of Vision: Intelligent Bacteriophage-Based Eyedrops For Clinical Multidrug-Resistant Ocular Surface Infections,"Clinical multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) is the leading cause of refractory bacterial keratitis (BK). However, the reported BK treatment methods lack biosecurity and bioavailability, which usually causes irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. Herein, for BK caused by clinically isolated MDR-PA infection, armed phages are modularized with the type I photosensitizer (PS) ACR-DMT, and an intelligent phage eyedrop is developed for combined phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These eyedrops maximize the advantages of bacteriophages and ACR-DMT, enabling more robust and specific targeting killing of MDR-PA under low oxygen-dependence, penetrating and disrupting biofilms, and efficiently preventing biofilm reformation. Altering the biofilm and immune microenvironments alleviates inflammation noninvasively, promotes corneal healing without scar formation, protects ocular tissues, restores visual function, and prevents long-term discomfort and pain. This strategy exhibits strong scalability, enables at-home treatment of ocular surface infections with great patient compliance and a favorable prognosis, and has significant potential for clinical application.","Chen L., Wu M.-Y., Chen S.-L., Hu R., Wang Y., Zeng W., Feng S., Ke M., Wang L., Chen S., Gu M.",10.1002/adma.202407268,"Advanced Materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"

Antimicrobial Peptide Dendrimers And Quorum-Sensing Inhibitors In Formulating Next-Generation Anti-Infection Cell Therapy Dressings For Burns,"Multidrug resistance infections are the main cause of failure in the pro-regenerative cell-mediated therapy of burn wounds. The collagen-based matrices for delivery of cells could be potential substrates to support bacterial growth and subsequent lysis of the collagen leading to a cell therapy loss. In this article, we report the development of a new generation of cell therapy formulations with the capacity to resist infections through the bactericidal effect of antimicrobial peptide dendrimers and the anti-virulence effect of anti-quorum sensing MvfR (PqsR) system compounds, which are incorporated into their formulation. Anti-quorum sensing compounds limit the pathogenicity and antibiotic tolerance of pathogenic bacteria involved in the burn wound infections, by inhibiting their virulence pathways. For the first time, we report a biological cell therapy dressing incorporating live progenitor cells, antimicrobial peptide dendrimers, and anti-MvfR compounds, which exhibit bactericidal and anti-virulence properties without compromising the viability of the progenitor cells.","Jafari P., Luscher A., Siriwardena T., Michetti M., Que Y.-A., Rahme L.G., Reymond J.-L., Raffoul W., Van Delden C., Applegate L.A., Köhler T.",10.3390/molecules26133839,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)"
How The Interplay Among The Tumor Microenvironment And The Gut Microbiota Influences The Stemness Of Colorectal Cancer Cells,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent cancer disease and involves a multi-step process in which intestinal cells acquire malignant characte-ristics. It is well established that the appearance of distal metastasis in CRC patients is the cause of a poor prognosis and treatment failure. Nevertheless, in the last decades, CRC aggressiveness and progression have been attributed to a specific cell population called CRC stem cells (CCSC) with features like tumor initiation capacity, self-renewal capacity, and acquired multidrug resistance. Emerging data highlight the concept of this cell subtype as a plastic entity that has a dynamic status and can be originated from different types of cells through genetic and epigenetic changes. These alterations are modulated by complex and dynamic crosstalk with environmental factors by paracrine signaling. It is known that in the tumor niche, different cell types, structures, and biomolecules coexist and interact with cancer cells favoring cancer growth and development. Together, these components constitute the tumor microenvironment (TME). Most recently, researchers have also deepened the influence of the complex variety of microor-ganisms that inhabit the intestinal mucosa, collectively known as gut microbiota, on CRC. Both TME and microorganisms participate in inflammatory processes that can drive the initiation and evolution of CRC. Since in the last decade, crucial advances have been made concerning to the synergistic interaction among the TME and gut microorganisms that condition the identity of CCSC, the data exposed in this review could provide valuable insights into the biology of CRC and the development of new targeted therapies.","Díaz M.B.N., Carriere P., Gentili C.",10.4252/wjsc.v15.i5.281,World Journal Of Stem Cells
Short- And Long-Term Single And Combined Effects Of Microplastics And Chromium On The Freshwater Water Flea Daphnia Magna,"In this study, we investigated the individual and combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and chromium (Cr) on the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna by measuring mortality, bioaccumulation, antioxidative response, multixenobiotic resistance activity, and sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis in short-term assays and in vivo endpoints including reproduction and adult survival rate in long-term assays. Exposure to MPs, Cr, and their combination caused significant deleterious effects and acute toxicity in D. magna. Alterations in oxidative stress occurred in the groups treated with MPs and Cr alone and together. However, upon co-exposure to MPs, the Cr concentration, measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, decreased, suggesting that MPs and Cr interact with each other. Based on enzymatic activities, we noted a decrease in MP egestion via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity in the MP-exposed groups, and multidrug resistance–associated protein activity increased in some of the MP-exposed animals depending on Cr concentration. On the other hand, MP exposure seemed to lead to mitochondrial transcription dysfunction induced by Cr via sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, these results indicate that co-exposure to MPs and Cr causes acute toxicity in D. magna but lacks the chronic toxicity (21 days) and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Cr exposure alone.","Jeong H., Lee Y.H., Sayed A.E.-D.H., Jeong C.-B., Zhou B., Lee J.-S., Byeon E.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106348,Aquatic Toxicology
Consensus Demonstrates Four Indicators Needed To Standardize Burn Wound Infection Reporting Across Trials In A Single-Country Study (Icon-B Study),"Introduction: Evidence-based interventions are needed to treat burn wound infection (BWI). Evidence syntheses have been limited by heterogeneity of indicators used to report BWI across trials. Consistent reporting of BWI would be facilitated by an agreed minimum set of indicators. The Infection Consensus in Burns study aimed to achieve expert consensus about a core indicator set (CIS) for BWI. Methods: The CIS was established through development of a long list of BWI indicators identified from a systematic review and expert input. In a Delphi survey, UK expert participants rated the indicators according to use in everyday practice, importance for diagnosis and frequency of observation in patients with BWI. Indicators were included in the CIS if ≥75% of participants agreed it was important for diagnosis and used in everyday practice, and ≥50% of participants rated it as frequently observed in patients with BWI. Results: One hundred and ninety-five indicators were identified from the systematic review and reduced to 29 survey items through merging of items with the same meaning. Seventy-five UK experts participated in the Delphi survey. Following a single survey round and a consensus meeting with an expert panel, four items were included in the CIS: pyrexia, spreading erythema, change in white cell count, and presence of pathogenic microbes. Discussion and conclusions: To facilitate evidence synthesis, a single-country systematic, expert-informed approach was taken to develop a CIS to be reported consistently across trials reporting BWI as an outcome. Future work requires verification of the CIS with international experts.","Davies A., Teare L., Falder S., Dumville J., Shah M., Jenkins A.T.A., Collins D., Dheansa B., Coy K., Booth S., Moore L., Marlow K., Agha R., Young A.",10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.022,Journal Of Hospital Infection

Improvement Of Biodegradation Of Pet Microplastics With Whole-Cell Biocatalyst By Interface Activation Reinforcement,"Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an important basic polymer, which was used widely in variety of fields. Due to its high crystallinity, compact structure and strong surface hydrophobicity, PET has prominent resistance to biodegradation. In recent years, microplastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics, was considered as serious threaten to ecosystems. In this study, alkali-resistant bacteria were used as whole-cell catalysts to try to improve the biodegradation of PET microplastics by increasing the bio-interfacial activity of the polymer substrate. Surfactants were applicated to enhance interfacial activation of enzyme and PET interactions. And an integrated strategy was constructed based on alkali resistant bacteria to catalysis the hydrolysis of PET. The results showed that Tween 20 had the most obvious promoting effect among the four interfacial biocatalysts on biological-chemical combined hydrolysis of PET microplastics with whole-cell biocatalysts in alkaline environment. Obvious etching and fracture were observed on the PET fibre surface after biodegradation in presence of surfactant. The weight loss rate of PET substrate can reach 11.04% after 5 days of biodegradation. Thus, this research provides a promising method for efficient degradation of PET microplastics.","Li X., Wu H., Gong J., Li Q., Li Z., Zhang J.",10.1080/09593330.2022.2052359,Environmental Technology (United Kingdom)
Surface Hydrophilicity Promotes Bacterial Twitching Motility,"Twitching motility is a form of bacterial surface translocation powered by the type IV pilus (T4P). It is frequently analyzed by interstitial colony expansion between agar and the polystyrene surfaces of petri dishes. In such assays, the twitching motility of Acinetobacter nosocomialis was observed with MacConkey but not Luria-Bertani (LB) agar media. One differencebetween these two media is the presence of bile salts as a selective agent in MacConkey but not in LB. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of bile salts to LB allowed A. nosocomialis to display twitching. Similarly, bile salts enhanced the twitching of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in LB. These observations suggest that there is a common mechanism, whereby bile salts enhance bacterial twitching and promote interstitial colony expansion. Bile salts disrupt lipid membranes and apply envelope stress as detergents. Surprisingly, their stimulatory effecton twitching appears not to be related to a bacterial physiological response to stressors. Rather, it is due to their ability to alter the physicochemical properties of a twitching surface. We observed that while other detergents promoted twitching like bile salts, stresses applied by antibiotics, including the outer membrane-targeting polymyxin B, did not enhance twitching motility. More importantly, bacteria displayed increased twitching on hydrophilic surfaces such as those of glass and tissue culture-treated polystyrene plastics, and bile salts no longer stimulated twitching on these surfaces. Together, our results show that altering the hydrophilicity of a twitching surface significantlyimpacts T4P functionality.","O'Hara M.T., Shimozono T.M., Dye K.J., Harris D., Yang Z.",10.1128/msphere.00390-24,Msphere
Microbiological And Chemical Evaluation Of Dairy Products Commercialized In The Lebanese Market,"Background and Aim: Cheese is considered an essential component of the Lebanese table, however, several foodborne illnesses have been reported due to cheese consumption. This study aimed to assess the microbiological quality and the occurrence of antibiotic and pesticide residues in two traditional Lebanese cheeses, Akkawi and Baladiyeh. In addition, drug resistance of isolated pathogens from the cheese samples was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Fifty Akkawi and Baladiyeh cheese samples were obtained in duplicate from 37 different commercial brands in supermarkets and shops from various regions of Lebanon. Samples of different weights were either individually vacuum packed or soaked in brine unpacked where it was placed in plastic bag after being purchased. Samples were homogenized to determine antibiotic and pesticide residues using liquid and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and microbiological evaluation was performed according to the International Organization for Standardization reference analytical methods. The disk diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of these isolates to antibiotics. Results: Microbiologically, 17% of Akkawi and 14% of Baladiyeh samples were found to be non-conforming. The bacterial isolates (n = 29) were tested for their susceptibility to 11 different antibiotics commonly prescribed in the Lebanese community or used for treating infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria and listeriosis. Each isolate was found to be resistant to at least three antibiotics. Liquid and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy analysis showed the absence of pesticide residues in all samples. However, sulfamethazine antibiotic residue was found in 14% of the samples. Conclusion: The results suggest that the cheese samples tested could cause foodborne illnesses due to the detection of pathogenic bacteria and are a public health concern due to the presence of antibiotic residues and the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms.","El Kojok H., Khalil M., Hage R., Jammoul R., Jammoul A., El Darra N.",10.14202/vetworld.2022.2575-2586,Veterinary World
Investigating A Possible Link Between Antiseptic Treatment And The Increased Occurrence Of Daptomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus,"Objectives: Because of a steady increase in the detection of daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) Staphylococcus aureus at three medical centres in Cologne, Germany, molecular surveillance was established from June 2016 to June 2018 to investigate the causes of the emergence and spread of respective isolates. Seventy-five S. aureus isolates, both DAP-R and DAP-susceptible, were collected from 42 patients for further analysis. Methods: Broth microdilution was used to determine the MICs for DAP and polyhexamethylene biguanide/polyhexanide (PHMB). To investigate the effect of PHMB on the development of DAP resistance, we performed selection experiments with PHMB. All isolates studied were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and molecular data were analysed comparatively. Results: Acquisition of DAP resistance was mainly observed in patients with acute and chronic wounds (40/42, 96.2%) treated with antiseptic (32/42, 76.2%) rather than systemic antibiotic therapy using DAP or vancomycin (7/42, 16.7%). DAP-R S. aureus had a diverse genetic background; however, within individual patients, isolates were closely related. At least three potential transmission events were detected. Most DAP-R isolates had concomitant elevated MICs for PHMB (50/54, 92.6%), and in vitro selection experiments confirmed that PHMB treatment is capable of generating DAP resistance. DAP resistance could be linked to 12 different polymorphisms in the mprF gene in the majority of clinical isolates (52/54, 96.3%) as well as in all in vitro selected strains. Discussion: DAP resistance in S. aureus can occur independently of prior antibiotic therapy and can be selected by PHMB. Therefore, wound treatment with PHMB may trigger individual resistance development associated with gain-of-function mutations in the mprF gene.","Wendel A.F., Otchwemah R., Layer-Nicolaou F., Mattner F., Tellez-Castillo C.J., Skov R., Oberländer H., Werner G., Strommenger B.",10.1016/j.cmi.2023.06.007,Clinical Microbiology And Infection
"Reducing Surgical Site Infections Caused By Staphylococcus Aureus, Using Hygiene Interventions At A Surgical Outpatient Clinic In A Dutch Hospital","Introduction: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria is part of the human skin flora. S. aureus is the leading cause of surgical site infections (SSI's) in healthcare facilities associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Objectives: The aim of this topic is to describe which strategies were taken to reduce the SSI's caused by S. aureus at a surgical outpatient clinic (SOC) in a Dutch general hospital. Methods: Data analyses over the last 4 years (2019-2022) were performed to determine the amount of SSI caused by S. aureus. Only wounds classified as clean (National Healthcare Safety Network) which had a positive culture within 30 days after surgery, were included. The association between the type of procedure, physician and the operation theater (OT) was examined. Thirty S. aureus samples were sequenced and observations and interviews with the SOC staff were performed. Based on the information obtained through the described methods, interventions were implemented. After implementation, data analyses were performed for 4 months to conclude whether the interventions were effective. Results: Data analyses showed an increase of S. aureus infections over the past 4 years (Table 1). There was no epidemiological link between the sequenced samples. Observations showed that physicians used colorless skin disinfectant. Patients entered the OT with visually contaminated hands. Implementation of colored disinfection and hand hygiene with water and soap, performed by the patient before disinfection, resulted in decreased infection rates (Table 2). Conclusion: A combination of observations, interviews, awareness and hygiene interventions resulted in a decrease of the SSI's caused by S. aureus.","Muller L., Van Piggelen A., Wijgergangs N., Dumont E., Renders N.",10.1186/s13756-023-01276-2,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
An Evaluation Of The Bacteriostatic Effect Of Platelet-Rich Plasma,"Chronic wounds are a considerable health burden with high morbidity and poor rates of healing. Colonisation of chronic wounds by bacteria can be a significant factor in their poor healing rate. These bacteria can develop antibiotic resistance over time and can lead to wound infections, systemic illness, and occasionally amputation. When a large number of micro-organisms colonise wounds, they can lead to biofilm formation, which are self-perpetuating colonies of bacteria closed within an extracellular matrix, which are poorly penetrated by antibiotics. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood product rich in growth factors and cytokines that are involved in an inflammatory response. PRP can be injected or applied to a wound as a topical gel, and there is some interest regarding its antimicrobial properties and whether this can improve wound healing. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro bacteriostatic effect of PRP. PRP was collected from healthy volunteers and processed into two preparations: activated PRP—activated with calcium chloride and ethanol; inactivated PRP. The activity of each preparation against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis was evaluated against a control by three experiments: bacterial kill assay to assess planktonic bacterial growth; plate colony assay to assess bacterial colony growth; and colony biofilm assay to assess biofilm growth. Compared with control, both preparations of PRP significantly inhibited growth of planktonic S aureus and S epidermis. Activated PRP reduced planktonic bacterial concentration more than inactivated PRP in both bacteria. Both PRP preparations significantly reduced bacterial colony counts for both bacteria when compared with control; however, there was no difference between the two. There was no difference found between biofilm growth in either PRP against control or against the other preparation. This study demonstrates that PRP does have an inhibitory effect on the growth of common wound pathogens. Activation may be an important factor in increasing the antimicrobial effect of PRP. However, we did not find evidence of an effect against more complex bacterial colonies.","Smith O.J., Wicaksana A., Davidson D., Spratt D., Mosahebi A.",10.1111/iwj.13545,International Wound Journal
Chromosomal Instability And Acquired Drug Resistance In Multiple Myeloma,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is an important hallmark of human cancer. CIN not only contributes to all stages of tumor development (initiation, promotion and progression) but also drives, in large measure, the acquisition of drug resistance by cancer cells. Although CIN is a cornerstone of the complex mutational architecture that underlies neoplastic cell development and tumor heterogeneity and has been tightly associated with treatment responses and survival of cancer patients, it may be one of the least understood features of the malignant phenotype in terms of genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms. Here we review new insights into the type of CIN seen in multiple myeloma (MM), a blood cancer of terminally differentiated, immunoglobulin-producing B-lymphocytes called plasma cells that remains incurable in the great majority of cases. We will consider bona fide myeloma CIN genes, methods for measuring CIN in myeloma cells, and novel approaches to CIN-targeted treatments of patients with myeloma. The new findings generate optimism that enhanced understanding of CIN will lead to the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance in MM in the not-so-distant future.","Wang W., Zhang Y., Chen R., Tian Z., Zhai Y., Janz S., Gu C., Yang Y.",10.18632/oncotarget.20829,Oncotarget
Anti-Candida Activity Of Antimicrobial Impregnated Central Venous Catheters,"Background: Whenever the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) remains high even after the implementation of preventive strategies, the use of chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine (CSS) or minocycline/rifampin (MR)-impregnated central venous catheters (CVCs) is currently recommended. Nevertheless, the efficacy of such CVCs against Candida albicans and other emerging non-albicans spp. has been insufficiently studied. This study aims to compare the activity of CSS and MR-impregnated CVCs against the yeasts most frequently isolated from CLABSIs. Methods: For biofilm formation assays, type strains and clinical isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis sensu stricto were used. Segments of standard polyurethane, MR and second-generation CSS-CVCs were tested. The biofilm metabolic activity was measured by a semi-quantitative XTT reduction assay. Results: CSS catheter segments significantly reduced the biofilm metabolic activity by all tested Candida spp., with inhibition ranging from 60% to 100%. The MR catheter segments promoted C. albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilm formation and exhibited an inconspicuous effect against C. glabrata. Conclusions: Among the recommended antimicrobial CVCs, CSS-CVCs proved to be superior in the inhibition of biofilm formation by the most frequent yeasts causing CLABSIs. Data from this in vitro study may suggest that patients at high risk for invasive candidosis could benefit from the use of CSS-CVCs.","Cobrado L., Silva-Dias A., Azevedo M.M., Rodrigues A.",10.1186/s13756-017-0269-x,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Possible Efficacy Losses Of Antimicrobial Surface Technologies After Reprocessing,"Introduction: Medical devices may be heavily contaminated with mircoorganisms during daily use and challenge the staff in reprocessing (cleaning and disinfection) them appropriate. Antimicrobial surface technologies could provide great advantages to reduce microbiological contamination. The principal effectiveness of these surface technologies can be demonstrated by standard methods such as the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS Z 2801). However, there are only a few studies to date on the activity of antimicrobial technologies after reprocessing and permanent use under regular clinical conditions. Objectives: In this work, various manufacturing strategies of common antimicrobial surface technologies were considered and examined regarding their potential impact on their effectiveness. A special focus has been on the possible impact of reprocessing in routine clinical setups on the functionality of the coatings. Methods: Therefore, in laboratory tests, various samples of different materials (glass, plastic, metal, tiles) were antimicrobially coated and the durability of the coatings was evaluated after abrasion tests simulating routine clinical reprocessing. The assessment was done by light and electron microscopic examination of the surface structures as well as by microbiological test methods (JIS Z 2801). Results: Our studies showed strong differences in the durability of the antimicrobial coating depending on the surface texture and the antimicrobially active coating substance used. While some of the coatings were still able to show an antimicrobial activity even after 500-fold wet abrasion, the coating on other test samples was already damaged after the first wiping step with distilled water. Conclusion: Our results suggest that both the antimicrobial active substance itself and the underlying surface material have a strong impact on the durability of the antimicrobial surface technology. Therefore, the assessment of the interplay of these factors is a critical issue and should play an important role in the development of new products with permanent antimicrobial activity in clinical settings.","Buhl S., Stich A., Peter J., Brückner R., Bulitta C.",10.1186/s13756-019-0567-6,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Osteosynthesis-Associated Infection In Maxillofacial Surgery By Bacterial Biofilms: A Retrospective Cohort Study Of 11 Years,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine risk factors for osteosynthesis-associated infections (OAI) with subsequent necessity of implant removal in oral and maxillofacial surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 3937 records of patients who received either orthognathic, trauma, or reconstructive jaw surgery from 2009 to 2021 were screened for osteosynthetic material removal due to infection. Treatment-intervals, volume of applied osteosynthetic material, and respective surgical procedures were also assessed. Moreover, intraoperatively harvested microbial flora was cultured and subsequently identified by MALDI TOF. Bacteria were then screened for antibiotic resistance via VITEK system or, if necessary, via agar diffusion or epsilometer test. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS statistical software. For statistical analysis of categorical variables, chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used. Continuous variables were compared via non-parametric tests. The level of significance for p-values was set at < 0.05. Descriptive analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The lower jaw was more prone to OAI than the mid face region. Larger volumes of osteosynthetic material led to significantly more OAI, resulting in reconstruction plates bearing the highest risk for OAI especially when compared to small-volume mini-plates frequently applied in trauma surgery. Among OAI associated with implant volumes smaller than 1500 mm3, the detection of Streptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Veillonella spp. was significantly elevated, whereas implant volumes larger than 1500 mm3 showed a significant increase of Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. High susceptibility rates (87.7-95.7%) were documented for 2nd- and 3rd-generation cephalosporines and piperacillin/tazobactam. CONCLUSION: High material load and lower jaw reconstruction bear the greatest risks for OAI. When working with large volume osteosynthetic implants, gram-negative pathogens must be considered when choosing an appropriate antibiotic regime. Suitable antibiotics include, e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam and 3rd-generation cephalosporines. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Osteosynthetic material utilized in reconstructive procedures of the lower jaw may be colonized with drug-resistant biofilms.","Zirk M., Markewitsch W., Peters F., Kröger N., Lentzen M.-P., Zoeller J.E., Zinser M.",10.1007/s00784-023-05059-2,Clinical Oral Investigations
Immunomodulatory Effects Of Immune Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles In Melanoma,"Melanoma, recognized as one of the most immunogenic malignancies in humans, holds paramount significance in the realm of immunotherapy. However, the emergence of drug resistance and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions underscore the pressing need to explore increasingly personalized immunotherapeutic modalities. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), pivotal derivatives of immune cells, assume pivotal roles by encapsulating proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids within bilayer lipid structures, thereby facilitating targeted delivery to other immune cells. This orchestrated process orchestrates critical functions including antigen presentation, immune modulation, and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. A burgeoning body of evidence underscores the vast therapeutic potential of EVs in melanoma treatment. This comprehensive review aims to delineate the roles of EVs derived from immune cells such as dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and T cells in the context of melanoma patients, thereby furnishing invaluable insights for the future direction of melanoma immunotherapy.",Nanru P.,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1442573,Frontiers In Immunology
Topical Antibiotic Elution In A Collagen-Rich Hydrogel Successfully Inhibits Bacterial Growth And Biofilm Formation In Vitro,"Chronic wounds are a prominent concern, accounting for $25 billion of health care costs annually. Biofilms have been implicated in delayed wound closure, but they are susceptible to developing antibiotic resistance and treatment options continue to be limited. A novel collagen-rich hydrogel derived from human extracellular matrix presents an avenue for treating chronic wounds by providing appropriate extracellular proteins for healing and promoting neovascularization. Using the hydrogel as a delivery system for localized secretion of a therapeutic dosage of antibiotics presents an attractive means of maximizing delivery while minimizing systemic side effects. We hypothesize that the hydrogel can provide controlled elution of antibiotics leading to inhibition of bacterial growth and disruption of biofilm formation. The rate of antibiotic elution from the collagen-rich hydrogel and the efficacy of biofilm disruption was assessed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial growth inhibition, biofilm disruption, and mammalian cell cytotoxicity were quantified using in vitro models. The antibiotic-loaded hydrogel showed sustained release of antibiotics for up to 24 h at therapeutic levels. The treatment inhibited bacterial growth and disrupted biofilm formation at multiple time points. The hydrogel was capable of accommodating various classes of antibiotics and did not result in cytotoxicity in mammalian fibroblasts or adipose stem cells. The antibiotic-loaded collagen-rich hydrogel is capable of controlled antibiotic release effective for bacteria cell death without native cell death. A human-derived hydrogel that is capable of eluting therapeutic levels of antibiotic is an exciting prospect in the field of chronic wound healing.","Min J.G., Sanchez Rangel U.J., Franklin A., Oda H., Wang Z., Chang J., Foxa P.M.",10.1128/AAC.00136-20,Antimicrobial Agents And Chemotherapy
"The Formation, Persistence, And Resistance To Disinfectant Of The Erysipelothrix Piscisicarius Biofilm","Erysipelothrix piscisicarius is an emergent pathogen in fish aquaculture, particularly in the ornamental fish trade. Very little is known on the biology of this pathogen; however, the recurrence of infection and disease outbreaks after removing the fish from a system and disinfecting the tank suggest its environmental persistence. Moreover, biofilm lifestyle in E. piscisicarius has been suspected but not previously shown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the formation of biofilms on an abiotic surface in Erysipelothrix spp. We used hydroxyapatite-coated plastic pegs to demonstrate the attachment, growth, and persistence of E. piscisicarius on abiotic surfaces in both fresh and marine environments and to investigate the susceptibility of this pathogen to different disinfectants that are used in the aquaculture industry. E. piscisicarius formed biofilms that persisted significantly longer than planktonic cells did in both freshwater and saltwater over a period of 120 h (P = 0.004). The biofilms were also more resistant to disinfectants than the planktonic cells were. Hydrogen peroxide was the most effective disinfectant against E. piscisicarius, and it eradicated the biofilms and planktonic cells at the recommended concentrations. In contrast, Virkon and bleach were able to eradicate only the planktonic cells. This information should be taken into consideration when developing biosecurity protocols in aquaculture systems, aquariums, and private collections.","Pomaranski E.K., Soto E.",10.1002/aah.10097,Journal Of Aquatic Animal Health
Phenotypically Plastic Drug-Resistant Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Cell Line Displays Enhanced Cellular Dynamics In A Zebrafish Xenograft Model,"Understanding the mechanisms by which cancer cells switch between different adaptive states and evade therapeutic interventions is essential for clinical management. In this study, the in vivo cellular dynamics of a new chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line displaying altered phenotype and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors were investigated in correlation with their parental cells for invasiveness/metastasis, angiogenic potential and population kinetics. We showed that the cells exhibiting drug resistance and plastic phenotype possess an increased capacity for invasion compared to their parental cells, that exposure to imatinib mesylate has the potential to enhance cellular motility and that in a leukaemic cell population, even a minority of plastic cells exhibit improved migratory ability. Furthermore, we show that these plastic cells have angiogenic and extravasation potential. The present study provides significant insights into the cellular dynamics displayed by a TKI-resistant, phenotypically plastic CML cell line, using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) xenograft model.","Baykal S., Yuce Z., Ozhan G.",10.1111/jcmm.70105,Journal Of Cellular And Molecular Medicine
Polystyrene Nanoparticles Induce Biofilm Formation In Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"In recent years, micro/nanoplastics have garnered widespread attention due to their ecological risks. In this study, we investigated the effects of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) of different sizes on the growth and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The results demonstrated that exposure to certain concentrations of PS-NPs significantly promoted bacterial biofilm formation. Meanwhile, we comprehensively revealed its mechanism whereby PS-NPs induced oxidative stress and altered bacterial membrane permeability by contacting or penetrating bacterial membranes. To counteract the stimulation by PS-NPs and reduce their toxicity, bacteria enhanced biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of biofilm-related genes, increasing EPS and virulence factors secretion, and enhancing bacterial motility through the participation of the quorum sensing (QS) system. Additionally, we also found that exposure to PS-NPs enhanced bacterial antibiotic resistance, posing a challenge to antimicrobial therapy. Our study reveals the toxic effects of nanoplastics and the defense mechanisms of bacteria, which has important implications for the risk assessment and management of environmental nanoplastics.","Huang P., Li Z., Liu R., Bartlam M., Wang Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133950,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Antibiotic Sorption Onto Microplastics In Water: A Critical Review Of The Factors, Mechanisms And Implications","Microplastics as vectors for contaminants in the environment is becoming a topic of public interest. Microplastics have been found to actively adsorb heavy metals, per-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and polybrominated diethers (PBDs) onto their surface. Particular interest in microplastics capacity to adsorb antibiotics needs further attention due to the potential role this interaction plays on antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic sorption experiments have been documented in the literature, but the data has not yet been critically reviewed. This review aims to comprehensively assess the factors that affect antibiotic sorption onto microplastics. It is recognised that the physico- chemical properties of the polymers, the antibiotic chemical properties, and the properties of the solution all play a crucial role in the antibiotic sorption capacity of microplastics. Weathering of microplastics was found to increase the antibiotic sorption capacity by up to 171%. An increase in solution salinity was found to decrease the sorption of antibiotics onto microplastics, in some instances by 100%. pH also has a substantial effect on sorption capacity, illustrating the significance of electrostatic interactions on the sorption of antibiotics onto microplastics. The need for a uniform experimental design when testing antibiotic sorption is highlighted to remove inconsistencies in the data currently presented. Current literature examines the link between antibiotic sorption and antibiotic resistance, however, further studies are still required to fully understand this emerging global crisis.","Stapleton M.J., Ansari A.J., Hai F.I.",10.1016/j.watres.2023.119790,Water Research
Reducing Wound Infection With Novel Antimicrobial Treatments In Human Ex Vivo And Porcine In Vivo Wound Models,"INTRODUCTION: Open wounds disrupt the barrier function of the skin and increase risks of infection. The current threat of antibiotic resistance coupled with slow development of novel antimicrobial treatments calls for new therapeutic options as well as new methods for evaluation of potential therapeutics. The aim of the present study was to develop a standardized infected human ex vivo wound model for rapid screening of novel treatments and to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) Plantaricin NC8 αβ (PLNC8αβ) using human ex vivo and porcine in vivo models. METHODS: The ex vivo wound model was based on skin from healthy patients undergoing plastic surgery (Swedish Ethical Review Authority approval: 2018/97-31). Circular full-thickness biopsies (8 mm diameter) with a central partial-thickness wound (4 mm diameter) were created using biopsy punches. Wounds were inoculated with 10(9) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and maintained under standard culture conditions up to 14 days. The in vivo wound model was conducted on four female pigs for ten days (Regional Animal Ethics Board approval: ID1418). S. aureus inoculated wounds were treated with topical administration (100 and 300 μM) of both D and L-enantiomers of the AMP PLNC8αβ. Moreover, topical gentamicin administration (3 μg/ml-10 μg/ml) was evaluated regarding eradication of infection. Tissue infection was monitored using quantitative cultures on selective media as well as immunofluorescent staining using primary antibodies directed towards S. aureus. Moreover, reepithelialization was evaluated using routine histology and immunofluorescent staining for pancytokeratin. RESULTS: Quantitative cultures revealed stable wound inoculation of approximately 10(7-8) colony forming units (CFU)/g of tissue without antimicrobial treatment. Immunofluorescent staining further confirmed presence of S. aureus, reaching through the dermal layer. Reepithelization was not observed in infected wounds 10-14 days post inoculation, whereas non-infected control wounds were covered with neoepidermis. Tropical treatment with PLNC8αβ reduced wound infection below the clinical relevance of 10(5) CFU/g. Combinational therapy with gentamicin completely eradicated infection seven days post inoculation. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The current study describes the establishment of a reproducible and standardized infected ex vivo wound model, which provides rapid screening of novel antimicrobial treatments. Furthermore, it presents a promising antimicrobial activity of the AMP PLNC8αβ against S.aureus in both human ex vivo and porcine in vivo wounds. In addition, enhanced efficacy of antibiotics administered together with the AMP may enable lower doses of antibiotics, reducing resistance development.","Sotra Z., Rinklake I., Hanna K., Starkenberg A., Kratz G., Rakar J., Junker J.P.E.",10.1089/ten.tea.2023.29043.abstracts,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Sensitization Of Ht29 Colorectal Cancer Cells To Vemurafenib In Three-Dimensional Collagen Cultures,"The extracellular matrix to which cancer cells adhere affects cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. We sought to examine the changes in sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells carrying the BRAF V600E mutation to vemurafenib cultured in three-dimensional (3D) collagen-I gels, while also identifying the signaling pathways involved in these changes. HT29 colorectal cancer cells were cultured in conventional tissue culture (TC) plastic plates or in collagen-I gels. The HT29 cells demonstrated approximately 10-fold higher sensitivity to vemurafenib in 3D-collagen-I gels compared with those cultured on conventional TC plastic plates. Furthermore, in cells cultured on TC plastic, vemurafenib was found to augment tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), while 3D-cultured cells expressed lower levels of FAK and vemurafenib did not affect its tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that FAK contributes to vemurafenib resistance. However, pharmacological inhibition of FAK did not sensitize the cells to vemurafenib. Also, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB2 family proteins was found to be lower in cells cultured in 3D-collagen gel compared with those in cells cultured on TC plastic. Afatinib, an inhibitor of the EGFR/ERBB family of kinases, sensitized the cells to higher concentrations of vemurafenib, implying their participation in vemurafenib resistance. Adhesion to collagen-I gel but not to the collagen-I-coated plastic surface sensitized the cells, suggesting that the rigidity of the media rather than adherence to collagen-I may be important for cellular sensitivity to vemurafenib.","Kikuchi K., Hoshino D.",10.1002/cbin.11262,Cell Biology International
Assessment Of Antimicrobial Effects Of Food Contact Materials Containing Silver On Growth Of Salmonella Typhimurium,"Food contact materials containing antibacterial properties are progressively appearing in the market. Items intended to provide antimicrobial effects such as increased shelf life and food safety are incorporating silver materials during the manufacture of such products. This study examined the total silver content, release capacity, and antibacterial activity of three different silver-containing food contact materials: plastic food storage containers, a plastic cutting board, and food wrapping paper. Silver content and release were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, and the results showed that, although the amount of silver in each product was similar, migration varied considerably with kind of material and simulant choice. Antimicrobial effect was tested by measuring the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium during or after exposure to the different food contact materials. The results showed that the food storage containers and wrapping paper delayed the growth of S. Typhimurium under certain conditions, but that these effects were short-lived. The strain of S. Typhimurium used in this study was found to be negative for the presence of tested silver resistance genes. The results of this study suggest that a thorough investigation should be required to show/claim the efficacy of silver-containing food contact materials for food safety purposes.","Williams K., Valencia L., Gokulan K., Trbojevich R., Khare S.",10.1016/j.fct.2016.12.014,Food And Chemical Toxicology
Progress In The Study Of Autophagy-Related Proteins Affecting Resistance To Chemotherapeutic Drugs In Leukemia,"Leukemia is a life-threatening malignant tumor of the hematopoietic system. Currently, the main treatment modalities are chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, increased drug resistance due to decreased sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs presents a major challenge in current treatments. Autophagy-associated proteins involved in autophagy initiation have now been shown to be involved in the development of various types of leukemia cells and are associated with drug resistance. Therefore, this review will explore the roles of autophagy-related proteins involved in four key autophagic processes: induction of autophagy and phagophore formation, phagophore extension, and autophagosome formation, on the development of various types of leukemias as well as drug resistance. Autophagy may become a promising therapeutic target for treating leukemia.","Li M., Li J., Zhang S., Zhou L., Zhu Y., Li S., Li Q., Wang J., Song R.",10.3389/fcell.2024.1394140,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Extracellular Vesicles And Cancer Stem Cells In Tumor Progression: New Therapeutic Perspectives,"Tumor burden is a complex microenvironment where different cell populations coexist and have intense cross-talk. Among them, a heterogeneous population of tumor cells with staminal features are grouped under the definition of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are also considered responsible for tumor progression, drug resistance, and disease relapse. Furthermore, CSCs secrete a wide variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different cargos, including proteins, lipids, ssDNA, dsDNA, mRNA, siRNA, or miRNA. EVs are internalized by other cells, orienting the microenvironment toward a protumorigenic and prometastatic one. Given their importance in tumor growth and metastasis, EVs could be exploited as a new therapeutic target. The inhibition of biogenesis, release, or uptake of EVs could represent an efficacious strategy to impair the cross-talk between CSCs and other cells present in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, natural or synthetic EVs could represent suitable carriers for drugs or bioactive molecules to target specific cell populations, including CSCs. This review will discuss the role of CSCs and EVs in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis and how they affect drug resistance and disease relapse. Furthermore, we will analyze the potential role of EVs as a target or vehicle of new therapies.","Scioli M.G., Terriaca S., Fiorelli E., Storti G., Fabbri G., Cervelli V., Orlandi A.",10.3390/ijms221910572,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences

Polystyrene Nanoplastics Change The Functional Traits Of Biofilm Communities In Freshwater Environment Revealed By Geochip 5.0,"There is an increasing concern regarding the potential effects of nanoplastics (NPs) on freshwater ecosystems. Considering the functional values of biofilms in freshwater, knowledge on whether and to what extent NPs can influence the ecosystem processes of biofilms were still limited. Herein, the freshwater biofilms cultured in lab were exposed to 100 nm polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs) of different dosages (1 and 10 mg/L) for 14 days. Confocal laser scanning microscope observation indicated that biofilms were dominated by filamentous, and spiral algae species and the intensity of extracellular polymeric substances increased under PS-NPs exposure. GeoChip 5.0 analysis revealed that PS-NPs exposure triggered a significant increase in functional genes α diversity (p < 0.05) and altered biofilms’ functional structure. Furthermore, the abundance of genes involved in the total carbon and nitrogen cycling were increased under PS-NPs exposure. The abundance of nitrogen fixation genes experienced the most pronounced increase (24.4%) under 1 mg/L PS-NPs treatment, consistent with the increase of ammonium in overlying water. Whereas antibiotic resistance genes and those related to photosynthetic pigments production were suppressed. These results provided direct evidence for PS-NPs’ effects on the biofilm functions in terms of biogeochemical cycling, improving our understanding of the potentials of NPs on freshwater ecosystems.","Miao L., Guo S., Wu J., Adyel T.M., Liu Z., Liu S., Hou J.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127117,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Antibiotic Resistance Patterns Of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales In Mohammed Vi University Hospital Of Marrakech, Morocco","Objectives: The emergence and spread of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has become a growing concern for health services, internationally, nationally, and regionally. In Morocco, the situation is more worrisome as studies on CRE are scarce and/or scattered and/or outdated. As a result, we carried out the present study to determine and update CRE prevalence at Mohammed VI University Hospital of Marrakech, Morocco. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was carried out from March 2018 to March 2020 on 41161 clinical specimens of 23,469 patients suspected of bacterial infections. Enterobacterales strains were isolated following standard bacteriological procedures. Bacterial strains were identified using BD-Phoenix and MALDI-TOF-MS. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined for 14 antibiotics. Carbapenemase production and phenotypic detection were characterized using modified carbapenem inactivation phenotypic and immunochromatographic methods. Results: All in all, 484 Enterobaterales resistant to at least one carbapenem were recovered. The majority was isolated from the neonatal unit (14%), followed by the urology-nephrology (11%), and plastic surgery departments (10%). K. pneumoniae (n = 232) was the most isolated, followed by E. cloacae (n = 148), E. coli (n = 56), and S. marcescens (n = 17). Antibiotic susceptibility profile showed high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (75.21%), gentamicin (84.50%), and cotrimoxazole (88.42%). Out of 484 CRE positive cultures, 388 (80.16%) were Carbapenemase-positive. Out of the latter, 170 were metallo-beta-lactamase producers (NDM), 162 OXA-48-like, and 56 both.

"Biosynthesis Of Gold Nanoparticles And Inhibition Of Various Stages Of Bacterial Biofilms Formed By Drug-Resistant Aeromonas Hydrophila, Escherichia Coli, And Klebsiella Pneumoniae","Biofilm development by bacteria is a serious issue in many different sectors, including the food, pharmaceutical, water, petroleum, and others. Because biofilms are difficult to remove due to their capacity to survive in bad environments, attempts were undertaken throughout this work to biologically manufacture gold nanoparticles with possible antibiofilm capabilities. During this study, 19 morphologically distinct fungal cultures were isolated from soil samples and used to synthesize gold nanoparticles. Among 19 fungi, 7 were producing gold nanoparticles and these particles were subjected to antimicrobial activity. Among 7 gold nanoparticles, nanoparticles synthesized from S2-10 isolate of fungi exhibited high antimicrobial activity toward biofilm-forming drug-resistant bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6 ± 0.57 mm), Aeromonas hydrophila (13.3 ± 0.57 mm) and Escherichia coli (10.0 ± 1.0 mm), and was used for further studies. The chosen nanoparticle also shown strong anti-biofilm action against test microorganisms on a variety of material substrates, including plastic, metal, and glass. These nanoparticles also exhibited inhibition of microcolony/initial biofilm, mature and preformed biofilm formed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (53.42 ± 4.45%, 62.14 ± 7.45%, and 24.12 ± 9.87%, respectively), Aeromonas hydrophila (43.89 ± 0.95%, 59.79 ± 1.19%, and 54.85 ± 6.50%, respectively) and Escherichia coli (45.28 ± 6.88%, 45.17 ± 3.94%, and 32.39 ± 4.16%, respectively). The physicochemical characterization of potential nanoparticles was conducted using UV–visible Spectrophotometer, X-ray diffractionSpectroscopy (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). These physicochemical analyses confirmed the formation of gold nanoparticles which were found to be spherical in shape with the size between 30 and 40 nm. Furthermore, the potential fungal isolate S2-10 was characterized as Aspergillus niger isolate CJ14 with the help of morphological and molecular techniques and deposited at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Accession number MN519438.1). Hence, it can be concluded that the gold nanoparticles produced using A. niger isolate CJ14 contain significant antibiofilm properties and can be used for developing antibiofilm products for future applications.","James C., Kumar G.",10.1007/s00203-022-03325-7,Archives Of Microbiology
The Effect Of Sport And Physical Activity On Transport Proteins: Implications For Cancer Prevention And Control,"The present contribution briefly overviews the major biological functions of the plasma membrane and of the transport proteins (transporters), which enable the movement of different molecules and substrates (either charged or uncharged) by passive (facilitated diffusion) or active transport. In particular, transporters are overviewed at the level of the skeletal muscles, which represent a highly complex, heterogeneous, plastic and dynamic tissue and are one of the most abundant tissues in humans, accounting for up to 40% of their total weight and containing up to 50%–75% of all body proteins. Moreover, it is shown how sport and physical activity finely tune and modulate human proteome, especially in terms of structural and functional improvements concerning the density of the transport proteins. These changes are among the factors responsible for the positive outcomes of training, which involve mainly the cardiovascular and the endocrine/metabolic systems. Different kinds of training (strength and endurance) enable to achieve such improvements, even though there seems to exist a dose-relationship intensity-dependent effect, with responses after 6–8 weeks of exercise and disappearing in the chronic period (years of training). Finally, exercise-induced changes at the level of transporters can play a role in terms of cancer prevention and management. Regular physical activity and exercise can, indeed, counteract the side-effects of chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin and other anthracycline derivatives, which may impair the functions of cardiac and skeletal muscles, probably modulating the expression of multidrug resistance proteins.","Sellami M., Bragazzi N.L.",10.1016/bs.apcsb.2020.07.001,Advances In Protein Chemistry And Structural Biology
Single And Combinational Sirna Therapy Of Cancer Cells: Probing Changes In Targeted And Nontargeted Mediators After Sirna Treatment,"Cancer cells are known to be heterogeneous and plastic, which imparts innate and acquired abilities to resist molecular targeting by short interfering RNA (siRNA). Not all cancer cells in a population would show a similar responsiveness to targeting of genes critical for their survival and even the responders could quickly transform and switch to alternative mechanism(s) for their survival. This study was designed to look at this phenomenon by analyzing the effect of siRNA silencing of selected protein mRNAs involved in cell survival and proliferation on other protein mRNAs that could contribute to cell survival. We compared the gene expression profile of the initial population after siRNA silencing to the subpopulation that survived the siRNA silencing, to identify potential overexpressions that might explain the cell survival. Our studies show that silencing well-selected protein mRNAs simultaneously could offer advantages compared to individual siRNA silencing due to an additional impact on the expression level of certain protein mRNAs. We also demonstrate that overexpression of certain protein mRNAs could explain the innate unresponsiveness of a subpopulation of cells. These observations could be a stepping stone for further investigation of the possibility of significant synergistic effect for this combinational RNA interference strategy.","Aliabadi H.M., Mahdipoor P., Bisoffi M., Hugh J.C., Uludağ H.",10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00711,Molecular Pharmaceutics
Invasive Non-Candida Fungal Infections In Acute Burns-A 13-Year Review Of A Single Institution And Review Of The Literature,"The past decade has demonstrated increased burn wound infections with atypical invasive fungal organisms. The range of previously regiospecific organisms has expanded, and plant pathogens are increasingly represented. Our institution sought to examine changes in severe fungal non-Candida infections in our patients, via retrospective review of patients admitted to our burn center from 2008 to 2021. We identified 37 patients with atypical invasive fungal infections. Non-Candida genera included Aspergillus (23), Fusarium (8), Mucor (6), and 13 cases of 11 different species, including the second-ever human case of Petriella setifera. Three fungi were resistant to at least one antifungal. Concomitant infections included Candida (19), Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (14), Enterococcus and Enterobacter (13), Pseudomonas (9), and 14 additional genera. Complete data was available for 18 patients, who had a median of 3.0 (IQR 8.5, range 0-15) additional bacteria required a median of 1 (IQR 7, range 0-14) systemic antibacterials and 2 (IQR 2.5, range 0-4) systemic antifungals. One case of total-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa required bacteriophage treatment. One case of Treponema pallidum was found in infected burn wound tissue. Every patient required Infectious Disease consultation. Eight patients became bacteremic and one developed Candida fermentatifungemia. There were five patient deaths (13.8%), all due to overwhelming polymicrobial infection. Burn patients with atypical invasive fungal infections can have severe concomitant polymicrobial infections and multidrug resistance with fatal results.

"The Sterility, Stability And Efficacy Of Repackaged Ziv-Aflibercept For Intravitreal Administration","To evaluate the sterility, stability, and efficacy of repackaged ziv-aflibercept in 1-mL plastic tuberculin syringes for intravitreal injection after storage for up to 90 days at controlled (4 °C) and ambient (25.8 °C) temperature. A total of 168 tuberculin-type 1-mL syringes were prepared containing ziv-aflibercept (100 mg/4 mL). Samples were stored at 4 °C and 25.8 °C for 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 90 days. At each time point, four samples were evaluated for the stability and binding affinity of anti-VEGF to VEGF (efficacy) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). All samples were analyzed for microbial growth. No microbial growth was obtained from any of the ziv-aflibercept samples during each time point, indicating that the repackaged ziv-aflibercept stored at 4 °C and 25.8 °C remained sterile. ELISA analysis revealed no significant decrease in concentration, and binding affinity was observed, indicating that the stability and efficacy were preserved. However, the concentration of ziv-aflibercept decreased less than the minimum expected concentration of 8 ng/mL after 60 days at 4 °C and after 30 days at 25.8 °C. The repackaged anti-VEGF drug ziv-aflibercept does not lose stability or efficacy and remains uncontaminated if prepared under sterile conditions and stored at 4 °C for up to 60 days or stored at 25.8 °C for up to 30 days.","Juhong J., Pongsachareonnont P.F., Somkijrungroj T., Mavichak A., Varadisai A., Chariyavilaskul P., Chatsuwan T., Suttichet T.B., Kulvichit K.",10.1038/s41598-022-06831-2,Scientific Reports
Size-Dependent Toxic Interaction Between Polystyrene Beads And Mercury On The Mercury Accumulation And Multixenobiotic Resistance (Mxr) Of Brackish Water Flea Diaphanosoma Celebensis,"Due to their worldwide distribution and persistence, mercury (Hg), and nano- and microplastics (NMPs) pose major threats to global ocean ecosystems. Hg and NMPs co-exist in the ocean and can interact with each other. However, information on the toxicity of this interaction to marine biota remains limited. Thus, we investigated the toxicological interaction between HgCl(2) (Hg) and NMPs by studying the influence of different sizes of polystyrene beads (0.05-, 0.5-, and 6-μm) on Hg accumulation in the brackish water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis. The Hg adsorption capacity of NPs (0.05-μm) was higher than that of MPs (0.5- and 6-μm). Only the group co-exposed to both Hg and NPs showed increased Hg content in D. celebensis. Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and transcriptional modulation of transporter genes (ABCBs and ABCCs) were decreased by NMP exposure, particularly by NPs, suggesting MXR disruption by NPs. However, only the activity of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs; ABCCs) increased with Hg exposure and decreased upon NP+Hg co-exposure, indicating an important role of ABCC in Hg efflux. Furthermore, in vivo toxicity tests showed a synergistic toxic interaction between Hg and NPs on the reproduction of D. celebensis. Our findings suggest that NPs have the potential to enhance the toxicity of Hg, increasing Hg accumulation not only by serving Hg as a carrier but also by disrupting MXR.","Yoo J.-W., Lee Y.-H., Kim J., Han S., Lee K.-W., Lee Y.-M.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117131,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Impact Of Simplified Personal Protective Equipment On Blood Culture Contamination During Covid-19 Treatment,"Introduction: Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields, is crucial for minimizing biohazard exposure. However, these protective measures can hinder healthcare workers from performing sophisticated procedures and adhering to sterilization guidelines. Objectives: This study aims to assess the impact of simplifying PPE on implementing on the adherence to sterilization guidelines by comparing blood culture contamination rates. Methods: We analyzed the contamination rate of blood cultures conducted at a 1,800-bed teaching hospital in Korea from January 2020 to December 2022. During the intensive PPE era (January 2020-December 2021), healthcare workers treated severe COVID-19 patients while wearing coveralls or long-sleeved surgical gowns, face shield, and double gloves for PPE. In the simplified PPE era (January 2022-December 2022), a disposable plastic apron with sleeves replaced the coveralls or long-sleeved surgical gowns, and single gloves were used instead of double gloves. Rates were presented as frequencies and compared by pairwise chi-squared tests. Results: Over the 36-month study period, a total of 2,353 blood cultures were performed in the COVID-19 treatment unit, with 1,127 blood cultures during the intensive PPE era and 1,226 during the simplified PPE era. No significant change in the blood culture contamination rate was observed between the two periods in the non-COVID-19 treatment units. However, in the COVID-19 unit, the blood culture contamination rate significantly decreased after PPE simplification (Table). Table. Blood culture contamination rates according to the ward type. Conclusion: Simplifying PPE could enhance adherence to aseptic techniques and improve clinical performance during COVID-19 treatment.","Lee M., Park J.H., Kim T.S., Kang C.K., Choe P.G., Park W.B., Kim N.J.",10.1186/s13756-023-01276-2,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Simultaneous Viscoelasticity And Sprayability In Antimicrobial Acetic Acid-Alginate Fluid Gels,"Acetic acid is a promising alternative to antibiotics for topical applications, particularly burn wounds, however its site specificity and retention are impaired by poor material properties. In this study, acetic acid was investigated as both the gelling agent and antimicrobial active in alginate fluid gels. The formed microstructure was found to be directly dependent on acetic acid concentration, leading to highly tuneable material properties. At clinically relevant concentrations of 2.5-5 % acetic acid, the fluid gels were elastically dominated at rest, with viscosities up to 7 orders of magnitude greater than acetic acid alone. These material properties imparted long term surface retention and microparticle barrier function, not seen with either acetic acid or alginate solutions. Most notably, sprayability was enhanced simultaneously with the increased viscosity and elasticity due to the introduction of a discretised microstructure, leading to a remarkable tenfold increase in spray coverage. Formulation was found not to inhibit antimicrobial activity, despite the less acidic pH, with common burn wound pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being equally susceptible to the fluid gels as to acetic acid solutions.","Robinson T.E., Clark C., Moakes R.J.A., Schofield Z., Moiemen N., Geoghegan J.A., Grover L.M.",10.1016/j.bioadv.2024.214051,Biomaterials Advances
Evolving Threat Of Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Upper Extremity Infections In The South Pacific: 2011-2015,"Background: Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) rates have been increasing worldwide and contribute to a growing ""global health security threat"" as reported by the WHO. Our group previously reported an overall rate of 7% in CA-MRSA upper extremity infections between 2004-2009 at the Auckland Regional Hand Unit. This fell below the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendation for empiric antimicrobial cover once local rates exceed 10-15%. We examined prevalence and characteristics of CA-MRSA upper extremity infections in our region over a subsequent 5-year period. Methods: One thousand two hundred and fifty-two patients with upper extremity infections requiring operative management between 2011 and 2015 inclusive were included in this study. Associated clinical characteristics were recorded including ethnicity, cultured organisms, antibiotic sensitivities, infection rate, and treatment practice. Results: One hundred and fifty (12%) of patients had culture positive CA-MRSA upper extremity infections. There was an increasing annual trend. Of note, rates of CA-MRSA in the Maori and Pacific Island ethnic subpopulations exceeded 15% in 2014 and 2015. Susceptibilities, associated factors and patient demographics are reported. Conclusions: Our unit enjoys significantly lower rates of CA-MRSA upper extremity infections than has been reported internationally. However, trends are increasing relative to our prior 6-year report, and the threshold for empiric treatment has been met within the Maori and Pacific Island ethnic subpopulations. This evolving threat is also highlighted by increasing cases of multi-drug resistant CA-MRSA. Evolving regional guidelines for empiric coverage of CA-MRSA among high-risk ethnic subpopulations identified by this study are underway.","Abeysekera N., Wong S., Jackson B., Buchanan D., Heiss-Dunlop W., Mathy J.A.",10.1142/S2424835519500164,Journal Of Hand Surgery Asian-Pacific Volume
Evidence-Based Hand Hygiene: Microbiological Validation Of The Fluorescein Training,"Introduction: Hand hygiene is the most efficient tool in fighting nosocomial infections. Besides compliance, special attention should be paid to technique. Flourescent trial (when hand hygiene is performed with an UV-dye containing handrub) is the most common way to examine the hand hygiene technique. Objectives: Our study investigated whether the qualifying flourescent regions on the hands are disinfected in fact. Methods: Artificial hand phantoms were fabricated from plastic and covered with cow skin to fit into regular-size Petri dishes. The phantoms were soaked into 0. 5 McF Staphylococcus epidermidis suspension. Selected regions were treated with flourescent hand rub (Visirub from Paul Hartmann AG, Heindenheim, DE), then images of the samples were recorded under 360 nm UV-A light (where the dye shines the most). Right afterwards, the phantoms were stamped onto blood agar. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. After culturing, image of S. epidermidis colonies were also recorded. Corresponding pairs of pictures (n = 25) were fed to a robust software image registration algorithm, thus obtaining pixel-to-pixel mapping between the two images (under UV and after-cultivation). This mapping enabled us to statistically evaluate the extent to which pathogen-free regions matched the disinfected areas of the hand phantom. Results: All samples were evaluated successfully. Coverage areas were counted and matched against each other. Average sensitivity and average specificity values were 0.95 ± 0.03 and 0.98 ± 0.02, respectively. This high sensitivity and specificity means that pictures recorded in UV-light are technically show same same coverage than of the results of the agar plates after culturing. Conclusion: We were able to prove that regions on the hand treated sufficiently with the UV-dye containing hand rub are in fact disinfected; not developing colonies after a regular blood agar culturing. This finding confirms that the flourescent trial is indeed a reliable method for verifying individual hand hygiene technique.","Lehotsky A., Bansaghi S., Szeremy P., Szilagyi L., Weber G., Haidegger T.",10.1186/s13756-017-0201-4,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Prevalence And Clinical Implications Of Bloodstream Infections In Intensive Care Patients With Or Without Burn Injury: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Purpose: Severe burn injuries are often accompanied by infections and associated with high morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and clinical impact of bacteremia between patients receiving intensive care with and without burns. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort study at the University Hospital Vienna, Austria, analyzed blood cultures from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with and without burns (2012–2022) to assess the prevalence of bacteremia, the associated pathogen distribution and the 60-day all-cause mortality. Results: In 1170 ICU patients, 303 with burns and 867 without, the prevalence of bacteremia was similar among patients with at least one blood culture (31/157 [19.7%] versus 44/213 [20.7%], OR [95%CI] = 0.95 [0.57–1.57]). Burn patients exhibited a significantly higher frequency of microbiological sampling (51.5% versus 24.5%, p < 0.001), resulting in a higher overall prevalence of bacteremia (10.2% versus 5.1%, p = 0.002). 16.2% of all identified pathogens were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The 60-day all-cause mortality was higher in patients with MDR pathogens than in patients without bacteremia (41.7% versus 10.6%, p = 0.026). Conclusion: Bacteremia prevalence was similar in burn and non-burn patients, with high rates of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The 60-day all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with MDR pathogens than in patients without bacteremia.","Bergmann F., Jorda A., Sollner J., Sawodny R., Kammerer K., List V., Prager M., Gelbenegger G., Kumpf K., Lagler H., Zeitlinger M., Radtke C.",10.1007/s10096-024-04877-w,European Journal Of Clinical Microbiology And Infectious Diseases
Evaluation Of Bacterial Survival On Inert Surfaces In A Hyperbaric Environment,"Introduction: The effects of hyperbaric oxygen on bacteria biological tissues are either bactericidal or bacteriostatic, depending on the type of bacteria. However, the effects on bacteria on inert surfaces is unknown. This may have implications for terminal cleaning methods and potentially cross-transmission of pathogens in hyperbaric chambers. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric environments on the bacterial survival on inert materials as compared to normal pressure environment. Methods: We deposited 10(6) cfu of either Staphylococcus aureus (NC 10788) or Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536) on 1 cm(2) strips of inert materials commonly found in hyperbaric chambers (plastic, metal and seat upholstery [imitation leather]). Three of each contaminated tiles were placed inside the hyperbaric chamber (Comex1200Alu) and exposed to a standard hyperbaric compression of 95 minutes duration (2.5 atm; 253.31 kPa). Corresponding control strips were placed outside the chamber (1 atm; 101.33 kPa) for 95 minutes. At the end of each experiment, the contaminated tiles were placed in 100 ml tryptone soy mixture, shaken vigorously, and then the recovering solution was inoculated on agar for 48 hours. The number of colonies for each tile was counted, and we compared the average logarithmic reductions between tiles inside and outside the chamber for each material and each bacterium using Student's t-test. All experiments were inspired by the application standard stage 2/step 2 NF EN 14561. Results: Mean log reductions of S. aureus and E. coli do not show statistically significant differences with exposure to either a normobaric (1 atm) or a hyperbaric (2.5 atm) environment in ambient air, regardless of the media used. Conclusion: Standard pressurization of air (2.5 atm for 95 minutes) has no proliferative or bactericidal action on S. aureus or E. coli colonies deposited on inert supports compared to those present outside a hyperbaric chamber. Further studies using different species and serial compressions are required to broaden our knowledge of bacterial survival in hyperbaric chambers.","Hendier L., Soule H., Abbas M., Magnan M.-A., Pittet D., Pignel R.",10.1186/s13756-019-0567-6,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Philtrum Length And Intercommissural Distance Measurements At Mixed Dentition Period,"Anthropometric measurements of the lip and mouth are of great importance in clinical dysmorphology as well as reconstructive plastic surgery. In this study, the philtrum length (PhL) and intercommissural distance (ICmD) nomograms for Egyptian children in the mixed dentition period were established. A group of 1,338 Egyptian students in primary schools (735 boys and 603 girls) were included in the study. The students were at mixed dentition period and their ages ranged from 7 to 12 years. Anthropometric norms of PhL and ICmD were developed with significant sex difference in certain groups. A ratio between PhL and ICmD was developed. These data will help facilitate both objective and subjective evaluation of the lip and mouth for proper diagnosis of orofacial anomalies and variations as well as for ideal treatment plans.","Mostafa M., Hassib N., Sayed I., Neamat A., Ramzy M., El-Badry T., Elgabry H., Salem H., Omar N., Ismail A., Ibrahim Y., Shebaita A., Allam A., Mostafa M.",10.1002/ajmg.a.38682,"American Journal Of Medical Genetics, Part A"
Differential Expression Profiles And Function Predictions For Trfs & Tirnas In Skin Injury Induced By Ultraviolet Irradiation,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major environmental factor contributing skin damage. As UV exposure is inevitable, it is necessary to pay attention to the underlying molecular mechanisms of UV-induced skin damage to develop effective therapies. tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) that are a novel class of short, non-coding RNAs. However, the functions behind tRFs & tiRNAs in UV-induced skin injury are not yet clear. Firstly, the animal model of ultraviolet irradiation induced skin damage was established. Then the skin samples were preserved for the follow-up experiment. Sequencing was used to screen expression profiles and predict target genes. Compared with normal skin, a total of 31 differentially expressed tRFs & tiRNAs were screened. Among these, 10 tRFs & tiRNAs were shown to be significantly different in expression levels, where there were 4 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated target genes. Bioinformatics analyses revealed potential up-regulated tsRNAs (tRF-Val-AAC-012, tRF-Pro-AGG-012, tRF-Val-CAC-018, tRF-Val-AAC-031) and down-regulated tsRNAs (tRF-Arg-CCT-002, tRF-Trp-TCA-001, tiRNA-Ser-GCT-001, tRF-Gly-CCC-019, tRF-Ala-TGC-001, tRF-Ala-TGC-002). In summary, it was speculated that tRF-Gly-CCC-019 plays an important role in acute skin injury induced by UVB radiation by regulating the ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) gene in the WNT signaling pathway. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of UV-induced skin injury.","Fang Y., Liu Y., Yan Y., Shen Y., Li Z., Li X., Zhang Y., Xue Z., Peng C., Chen X., Cao K., Zhou J.",10.3389/fcell.2021.707572,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Hand Hygiene Compliance In Intensive Care Units: An Observational Study,"AIM: Health care-associated infections along with antibiotic resistance are a leading risk for patient safety in intensive care units. Hygienic hand disinfection is still regarded as the most effective, simplest, and most cost-effective measure to reduce health care-associated infections. To improve hand hygiene compliance and to prevent health care-associated infections, interventions of the ""German Clean Hands Campaign"" were implemented in a university hospital. METHODS: Observational single-center study using direct observation and feedback. Hand hygiene performance was assessed in 12 intensive care units between 2013 and 2017. Linear mixed model regression analyses were used to estimate the compliance trend over time. RESULTS: In total, 10 315 ""my five moments for hand hygiene"" were observed. The mean hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 75.1% to 88.6% during the study period, yielding an estimated increase of about 4.5% per year. However, there are differences in compliance between occupational groups (physicians: between 61.2% and 77.1%; nurses: between 80.2% and 90.9%; others: between 61.3% and 82.4%). CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of the ""German Clean Hands Campaign"" interventions, an overall significant improvement of hand hygiene was detected. Compliance measurements helped to raise awareness among health care professional groups.","Hoffmann M., Sendlhofer G., Gombotz V., Pregartner G., Zierler R., Schwarz C., Tax C., Brunner G.",10.1111/ijn.12789,International Journal Of Nursing Practice
Infections In Critically Ill Burn Patients,"Severe burn patients are one subset of critically patients in which the burn injury increases the risk of infection, systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. The infections are usually related to devices and to the burn wound. Most infections, as in other critically ill patients, are preceded by colonization of the digestive tract and the preventative measures include selective digestive decontamination and hygienic measures. Early excision of deep burn wound and appropriate use of topical antimicrobials and dressings are considered of paramount importance in the treatment of burns.Severe burn patients usually have some level of systemic inflammation. The difficulty to differentiate inflammation from sepsis is relevant since therapy differs between patients with and those without sepsis. The delay in prescribing antimicrobials increases morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the widespread use of antibiotics for all such patients is likely to increase antibiotic resistance, and costs. Unfortunately the clinical usefulness of biomarkers for differential diagnosis between inflammation and sepsis has not been yet properly evaluated.Severe burn injury induces physiological response that significantly alters drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These alterations impact antimicrobials distribution and excretion. Nevertheless the current available literature shows that there is a paucity of information to support routine dose recommendations.","Hidalgo F., Mas D., Rubio M., Garcia-Hierro P.",10.1016/j.medin.2016.02.001,Medicina Intensiva
Pathogenic Detection By Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing In Skin And Soft Tissue Infection,"Background/Aim: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) can be life-threatening, but the conventional bacterial cultures have low sensitivity and are time-consuming. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is widely used as a diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens from infection sites. However, the use of mNGS for pathogen detection in SSTIs and related research is still relatively limited. Patients and Methods: From January 2020 to October 2021, 19 SSTI samples from 16 patients were collected in a single center (Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan). The clinical samples were simultaneously subjected to mNGS and conventional bacterial culture methods to detect pathogens. Clinical characteristics were prospectively collected through electronic chart review. The microbiological findings from conventional bacterial culture and mNGS were analyzed and compared. Results: The mNGS method detected a higher proportion of multiple pathogens in SSTIs compared to conventional bacterial culture methods. Pseudomonas spp. was among the most commonly identified Gram-negative bacilli using mNGS. Additionally, the mNGS method identified several rare pathogens in patients with SSTIs, including Granulicatella adiacens, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacteroides fragilis. Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in 10 samples (52.6%) using the mNGS method, including genes for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, Ambler class C β-lactamases, and carbapenemase. Conclusion: mNGS not only plays an important role in the detection of pathogens in soft tissue infections, but also informs clinical professionals about the presence of additional microbes that may be important for treatment decisions. Further studies comparing conventional pathogen culture with the mNGS method in SSTIs are required.","Yeh T.-K., Huang Y.-T., Liu P.-Y., Mao Y.-C., Lai C.-S., Lai K.-L., Tseng C.-H., Liu C.-W., Huang W.-H., Huang H.-P., Lin K.-P.",10.21873/invivo.13703,In Vivo
N6-Methyladenosine (M6A) In Cancer Stem Cell: From Molecular Mechanisms To Therapeutic Implications,"The emergence of drug resistance and metastasis has long been a difficult problem for cancer treatment. Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cell populations are key factors in the regulation of cancer aggressiveness, relapse and drug resistance. Cancer stem cell (CSC) populations are highly plastic and self-renewing, giving them unique metabolic, metastatic, and chemotherapy resistance properties. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification of mRNA and is involved in a variety of cell growth and development processes, including RNA transcription, alternative splicing, degradation, and translation. It has also been linked to the development of various cancers. At present, the important role of m6A in tumour progression is gradually attracting attention, especially in the tumour stemness regulation process. Abnormal m6A modifications regulate tumour metastasis, recurrence and drug resistance. This paper aims to explore the regulatory mechanism of m6A in CSCs and clinical therapy, clarify its regulatory network, and provide theoretical guidance for the development of clinical targets and improvement of therapeutic effects.","Wang L., Tang Y.",10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114846,Biomedicine And Pharmacotherapy
Ultrasound-Mediated Piezoelectric Microneedles Regulating Macrophage Polarization And Remodeling Pathological Microenvironment For Lymphedema Improvement,"Lymphedema, a severe and complex inflammatory disease caused by lymphatic system insufficiency and impeded lymphatic drainage that causes an enormous physical and psychological burden on patients and may even lead to death, has long been a challenging issue in the medical field. Clinically, conventional approaches including surgical treatment and conservative treatment have been employed for lymphedema therapy, but their curative effect is still unsatisfactory because of high operational difficulty, high cost, and long-term reliance. In this study, a novel kind of piezoelectric microneedle driven by ultrasound (US) is proposed to regulate macrophage polarization and remodel the pathological inflammatory microenvironment in a noninvasive manner, thereby promoting lymphatic regeneration and improving lymphedema. US-mediated piezoelectric microneedles can significantly enhance the anti-inflammatory M2-type polarization of macrophages while suppressing pro-inflammatory M1-type polarization in vitro. Enhancements in macrophage M2 polarization can trigger increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, and Arg-1) that promote inflammatory microenvironment remodeling and immune rebalancing. In a mouse-tail lymphedema model, a higher proportion of M2 macrophage polarization marker CD206 is observed accompanied by normal lymphangiogenesis and lymphedema subsiding following piezoelectric microneedles with US stimulation treatment. Additionally, based on RNA sequencing and mechanistic investigation, it was revealed that US-mediated piezoelectric microneedles can activate signaling pathways related to M2 macrophage polarization that regulate inflammatory responses and improve lymphatic function, consequently alleviating lymphedema. Collectively, this study provides a new strategy for lymphedema therapy in a noninvasive and drug-free manner as well as a potent tool to manipulate macrophages for other immunological diseases.","Wang X., Han C., Xia J., Cui C., Min P., Meng X., Sun Y., Wen K., Feng C., Zhang Y., Li K.",10.1021/acsnano.4c14292,Acs Nano
Effect Of Human Fat Graft On Breast Cancer Metastasis In A Murine Model,"BACKGROUND: Isolated adipose stem cells have been reported to encourage migration and early metastasis of breast cancer. Mimicking a surgical situation, the authors developed a human breast cancer model to evaluate in vivo whether human adipose tissue promotes tumor growth and invasion.METHODS: Human adipose tissue was obtained from four patients. The MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured with a lentiviral vector encoding a puromycin resistance gene and mCherry fluorescent protein. Virus-infected cells were selected. Animals were injected in the left renal capsule and divided into three experimental groups: group A, MDA-MB-468 cells (n = 4); group B, MDA-MB-468 cells/human adipose tissue (n = 4); and group C, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/F-12 medium (negative control, n = 4). Metastatic development was monitored using an in vivo imaging system. Small breast epithelial mucin (SBEM), human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRTh), and murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRTm) expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect multifocal metastases in right/left renal capsule, liver, spleen, and pancreas.RESULTS: Metastasis was observed between postinjection days 37 and 44. No significant differences were found in survival rates between groups (group A, 157 ± 42.60 days; group B, 169 ± 40.17 days). All samples expressed HPRTm. HPRTh and SBEM were expressed in left renal capsules from all group A and B mice, whereas in spleen, liver, pancreas, and right renal capsule the HPRTm and SBEM expression was not constant in all samples of group A and B mice. Differences were found between groups in HPRTh and SBEM expression but were not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Human adipose tissue used to restore breast defects after oncologic resection did not increase metastasis development risk when there were residual breast cancer cells in proximity.","Moltó-García R., González-Alonso V., Villaverde-Doménech M.E., Novella-Maestre E.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000003274,Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery
Multifunctional Antibacterial Bioactive Nanoglass Hydrogel For Normal And Mrsa Infected Wound Repair,"Large-scale skin damage brings potential risk to patients, such as imbalance of skin homeostasis, inflammation, fluid loss and bacterial infection. Moreover, multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB) infection is still a great challenge for skin damage repair. Herein, we developed an injectable self-healing bioactive nanoglass hydrogel (FABA) with robust antibacterial and anti-inflammatory ability for normal and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infected skin wound repair. FABA hydrogel was fabricated facilely by the self-crosslinking of F127-CHO (FA) and alendronate sodium (AL)-decorated Si-Ca-Cu nanoglass (BA). FABA hydrogel could significantly inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and MRSA in vitro, while showing good cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility. In addition, FABA hydrogel could inhibit the expression of proinflammatory factor TNF-α and enhance the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-4/ IL-10. Based on its versatility, FABA hydrogel could complete wound closure efficiently (75% at day 3 for normal wound, 70% at day 3 for MRSA wound), which was almost 3 times higher than control wound, which was related with the decrease of inflammatory factor in early wound. This work suggested that FABA hydrogel could be a promising dressing for acute and MRSA-infected wound repair.

Pulsed Electric Fields For Burn Wound Disinfection In A Murine Model,"Emerging bacterial resistance renders many antibiotics ineffective, making alternative strategies of wound disinfection important. Here the authors report on a new, physical burn wound disinfection method: pulsed electric fields (PEFs). High voltage, short PEFs create nonthermal, permanent damage to cell membranes, possibly by irreversible electroporation. In medicine, PEF technology has recently been used for nonthermal ablation of solid tumors. The authors have expanded the spectrum of PEF applications in medicine to burn wound disinfection. A third-degree burn was induced on the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. Immediately after the injury, the burn wound was infected with Acinetobacter baumannii expressing the luxCDABE operon. Thirty minutes after infection, the infected areas were treated with 80 pulses delivered at 500 V/mm, 70 μs, 1 Hz. The authors used bioluminescence to quantify bacteria on skin. Three animals were used for each experimental condition. PEFs were effective in the disinfection of infected burned murine skin. The bacterial load reduction correlated with the number of delivered pulses. Forty pulses of 500 V/mm led to a 2.04 ± 0.29 Log10 reduction in bacterial load; 80 pulses led to the immediate 5.53 ± 0.30 Log10 reduction. Three hours after PEF, the bacterial reduction of the skin treated with 500 V/mm, 80 pulses was 4.91 ± 0.71 Log10. The authors introduce a new method of wound disinfection using high voltage, short PEFs. They believe that PEF technology may represent an important alternative to antibiotics in addressing bacterial contamination of wounds, particularly those contaminated with multidrug-resistant bacteria.","Golberg A., Felix Broelsch G., Vecchio D., Khan S., Hamblin M.R., Austen W.G., Sheridan R.L., Yarmush M.L.",10.1097/BCR.0000000000000157,Journal Of Burn Care And Research
Insights Into The Community Structure And Environmental Functions Of Water Hyacinth Rhizobiome In Urban River Ecosystem,"Water hyacinth (WH) is a widespread floating invasive aquatic plant with a prolific reproductive and dispersion rate. With the aid of its root-associated microbes, WH significantly modulates the ecosystem's functioning. Despite their irrevocable importance, the WH microbiome remains unexplored in detail. Here, we present a shotgun sequencing analysis of WH rhizobiome predominant in urban rivers and their surrounding water to unveil the diversity drivers and functional relationship. The core microbiome of the WH mainly consisted of the methane-metabolizing archaebacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are probably driving the methane and sulfur metabolic flux along the vegetative zone in the water. The beta diversity analysis revealed temporal variations (River WH_2020 vs. WH_2022) (R of 0.8 to 1 and R2 of 0.17 to 0.41), which probably could be attributed to the transient taxa as there was a higher sharing of core bacteria (48%). Also, the WH microbiome significantly differed (R = 0.46 to 1.0 and R2 of 0.18 to 0.52) from its surrounding water. Further, the functional analysis predicted 140 pollutant-degrading enzymes (PDEs) well-implicated in various xenobiotic pollutant degradation, including hydrocarbons, plastics, and aromatic dyes. These PDEs were mapped to bacterial genera such as Hydrogenophaga, Ideonella, Rubrivivax, Dechloromonas, and Thauera, which are well-reported for facilitating the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds. The higher prevalence of metal and biocide resistance genes further highlighted the persistence of resistant microbes assisting WH in bioremediation applications.","Yadav R., Rajput V., Dharne M.",10.1007/s11356-024-35187-5,Environmental Science And Pollution Research International
Synergistic Effects Of Antimicrobial Peptide Dendrimer-Chitosan Polymer Conjugates Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"We report herein a new chemical platform for coupling chitosan derivatives to antimicrobial peptide dendrimers (AMPDs) with different degrees of ramification and molecular weights via thiol-maleimide reactions. Previous studies showed that simple incorporation of AMPDs to polymeric hydrogels resulted in a loss of antibacterial activity and augmented cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. We have shown that coupling AMPDs to chitosan derivatives enabled the two compounds to act synergistically. We showed that the antimicrobial activity was preserved when incorporating AMPD conjugates into various biopolymer formulations, including nanoparticles, gels, and foams. Investigating their mechanism of action using electron and time-lapse microscopy, we showed that the AMPD-chitosan conjugates were internalized after damaging outer and inner Gram-negative bacterial membranes. We also showed the absence of AMPD conjugates toxicity to mammalian cells. This chemical technological platform could be used for the development of new membrane disruptive therapeutics to eradicate pathogens present in acute and chronic wounds.","Patrulea V., Gan B.-H., Perron K., Cai X., Abdel-Sayed P., Sublet E., Ducret V., Nerhot N.P., Applegate L.A., Borchard G., Reymond J.-L., Jordan O.",10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.119025,Carbohydrate Polymers
Contactin 1 Modulates Pegylated Arginase Resistance In Small Cell Lung Cancer Through Induction Of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,"Drug resistance is a major hurdle in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Previously we demonstrated the potential anticancer effect of pegylated arginase BCT-100 in SCLC cell lines and xenograft models. To facilitate future clinical application of BCT-100 in SCLC treatment, we elucidated the potential mechanisms that underlie acquired drug resistance to BCT-100. H446 and H526 SCLC cells were serially cultured in stepwise increasing concentrations of BCT-100 until stable BCT-100-resistant cell lines emerged (H446-BR and H526-BR). Compared with parent cells, H446-BR and H526-BR displayed stronger migration ability, anoikis resistance and EMT progression. Gene chip assay was employed to select three potential targets (CDH17, CNTN-1 and IGF2BP1). Silencing CNTN-1 rather than CDH17 or IGF2BP1 in H446-BR and H526-BR cells re-sensitized resistant cells to BCT-100 treatment and attenuated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. The AKT signaling pathway was activated in H446-BR and H526-BR cells accompanied by EMT progression, and AKT inhibitor LY294002 reversed the EMT progression in resistant cells.","Xu S., Lam S.-K., Cheng P.N.-M., Ho J.C.-M.",10.1038/s41598-019-48476-8,Scientific Reports

Compassionate Use Of Cefiderocol In A Complex Case Of Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Fracture-Related Infection: A Comprehensive Approach And Multidisciplinary Management: Compassionate Use Of Cefiderocol In A Complex Case Of Extensively Drug-Resistant,"Purpose: Fracture-related infections (FRI) pose a difficult management problem, as they require numerous surgical interventions and extended antibiotic treatments, especially when a multidrug-resistant organism is involved, with a paucity of available literature that provides guidance. Results: A 42 year-old male presents an open diaphyseal tibia and fibula fracture, complicated by soft tissue necrosis and infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-Ab). Initially treated with a damage control external fixator, the patient underwent multiple surgical procedures, including radical debridement, negative pressure wound therapy, external fixator revisions and reconstructive surgery using a latissimus dorsi free flap. The emergence of colistin resistance in the Acinetobacter baumannii strain led to the compassionate use of cefiderocol, finally achieving clinical cure. Conclusions: This case report is one of the firsts that highlights the potential efficacy of cefiderocol in treating challenging bone and joint infections sustained by XDR-Ab. The successful outcome also emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach in achieving favorable results in complex FRI.","Petrucci F., Perciballi B., Rivano Capparuccia M., Iaiani G., Lo Torto F., Ribuffo D., Gumina S., De Meo D.",10.1007/s15010-024-02294-x,Infection
Vitamin D3 Improves Adipose Stromal Cell Survival And Human Fat Graft Retention In Xenograft Model,"Adipose stem cells are considered one of the primary drivers of autologous fat graft biological activity and survival. We have previously demonstrated that hormonally active VD3 improved adipose stem cell viability in ex vivo and in vivo fat graftingmodels. In this study,we evaluated the inactive formofVD3 (cholecalciferol) on adipose stromal cell (ASC) phenotype during hypoxia and the subsequent effect on human fat graft retention in the xenograftmodel. Lipoaspirate collected fromsix human donors was used for ex vivo particle culture studies and isolatedASCstudies. Adipose particles were treated with increasing doses of VD3 to determine impact on ASC survival. Expanded stromal cells were treated with VD3 during hypoxic culture and assessed for viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial activity, and nitric oxide (NO) release via caspase, DAF-FM, or TMRM. Finally, 40 Nu/J mice receiving bilateral dorsal human lipoaspirate were treated thrice weekly with (1) vehicle control, (2) 50 ng calcitriol, (3) 50 ng VD3, (4) 500 ng VD3, and (5) 5,000 ng VD3 for 12 weeks, n = 8 per group. Graft weight, volume, and architecture were analyzed. Adipose particles treated with dose-escalating VD3 had significantly increased ASC viability compared with control (P < 0.01). Under hypoxia, ASCs treated with 1 nM VD3 had significantly greater viability than untreated and pretreated cells (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) and significantly lower apoptosis-to-viability ratio (P < 0.01). ASCs pretreated with 1 nM VD3 had significantly lower NO release (P < 0.05) and lower mitochondrial polarization (P < 0.05) compared with controls. In vivo results showed mice receiving 5,000 ng VD3 had significantly greater graft weight (P < 0.05) and volume (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks of treatment compared with controls. Grafts had enhanced neovascularization, intact adipocyte architecture, and absence of oil cysts. VD3 is an overthe-counter nutritional supplement with a known safety profile in humans. Our xenograft model suggests administering VD3 at the time of surgery may significantly improve fat graft retention.","Gavrilescu A., Loder S.J., Ricketts R., Lee P., Ramkumar D., Shaaban B., Elmeanawy A., Vagonis A., Gusenoff J.A., Rubin J.P., Kokai L.E.",10.1089/scd.2024.0056,Stem Cells And Development
Modelling Bistable Tumour Population Dynamics To Design Effective Treatment Strategies,"Despite recent advances in targeted drugs and immunotherapy, cancer remains “the emperor of all maladies” due to almost inevitable emergence of resistance. Drug resistance is thought to be driven by genetic alterations and/or dynamic plasticity that deregulate pathway activities and regulatory programs of a highly heterogeneous tumour. In this study, we propose a modelling framework to simulate population dynamics of heterogeneous tumour cells with reversible drug resistance. Drug sensitivity of a tumour cell is determined by its internal states, which are demarcated by coordinated activities of multiple interconnected oncogenic pathways. Transitions between cellular states depend on the effects of targeted drugs and regulatory relations between the pathways. Under this framework, we build a simple model to capture drug resistance characteristics of BRAF-mutant melanoma, where two cell states are determined by two mutually inhibitory – main and alternative – pathways. We assume that cells with an activated main pathway are proliferative yet sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor, and cells with an activated alternative pathway are quiescent but resistant to the drug. We describe a dynamical process of tumour growth under various drug regimens using the explicit solutions of mean-field equations. Based on these solutions, we compare efficacy of three treatment strategies from simulated data: static treatments with continuous and constant dosages, periodic treatments with regular intermittent active phases and drug holidays, and treatments derived from optimal control theory (OCT). Periodic treatments outperform static treatments with a considerable margin, while treatments based on OCT outperform the best periodic treatment. Our results provide insights regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for heterogeneous tumours, and may guide the development of optimal therapeutic strategies to circumvent plastic drug resistance. They can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of suboptimal treatments that may account for side effects of the treatment and the cost of its application.","Akhmetzhanov A.R., Kim J.W., Sullivan R., Beckman R.A., Tamayo P., Yeang C.-H.",10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.05.005,Journal Of Theoretical Biology

"Influence Of Using Perforated Plastic Flooring Beneath The Waterline On Growth Performance, Litter Quality, And Footpad Health Of Broiler Chickens: A Field Study","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of slatted flooring beneath waterlines in broiler barns on litter quality and, subsequently, footpad health. The hypothesis tested was that installing slatted flooring underneath waterlines helps to improve litter quality and thus reduces footpad diseases, enhancing animal welfare as a result. Five experimental runs with two groups were conducted. Each run was defined as one fattening period of 32 days and consisted of 15,000 broiler Ross 308 of both sexes. Every barn was divided into three areas (drinkers, feeders, and comfort area) for weekly sampling. No influence on growth performance was noted. The slatted flooring influenced the litter quality by preventing the litter in the experimental group (EG = 690 ± 167 g/kg DM) from becoming moisture until day 14 of the fattening period compared to the control group (CON = 636 ± 198 g/kg DM). The footpad health was also influenced by using slatted flooring, with lower camerabased footpad scores in the EG (8.80) compared to CON (22.0) at the slaughterhouse (p = 0.0258). Installing slatted flooring beneath the waterline reduced the moisture of the litter compared to the control barn in the first two weeks of age and showed a positive effect on the footpad health of the broilers at the end of fattening, which indicates an improvement in animal welfare.","Sonnabend S.-J., Spieß F., Reckels B., Ahmed M.F.E., El-Wahab A.A., Sürie C., Lingens J.B., Visscher C.",10.3390/ani12141749,Animals
"Life, Death And Rebirth Of Avirulence Effectors In A Fungal Pathogen Of Brassica Crops, Leptosphaeria Maculans","Contents 526 I. 526 II. 527 III. 527 IV. 529 V. 529 VI. 530 VII. 530 531 References 531 SUMMARY: In agricultural systems, major (R) genes for resistance in plants exert strong selection pressure on cognate/corresponding avirulence effector genes of phytopathogens. However, a complex interplay often exists between trade-offs linked to effector function and the need to escape R gene recognition. Here, using the Leptosphaeria maculans-oilseed rape pathosystem we review evolution of effectors submitted to multiple resistance gene selection. Characteristics of this pathosystem include a crop in which resistance genes have been deployed intensively resulting in 'boom and bust' cycles; a fungal pathogen with a high adaptive potential in which seven avirulence genes are cloned and for which population surveys have been coupled with molecular analysis of events responsible for virulence. The mode of evolution of avirulence genes, all located in dispensable parts of the 'two-speed' genome, is a highly dynamic gene-specific process. In some instances, avirulence genes are readily deleted under selection. However, others, even when located in the most plastic genome regions, undergo only limited point mutations or their avirulence phenotype is 'camouflaged' by another avirulence gene. Thus, while hundreds of effector genes are present, some effectors are likely to have an important and nonredundant function, suggesting functional redundancy and dispensability of effectors might not be the rule.","Rouxel T., Balesdent M.-H.",10.1111/nph.14411,The New Phytologist
Systematic Screening Of Particle Engineered Polymers For The Preparation Of Multiparticulates Embedded Orally Disintegrating Tablets,"This paper evaluated polymers' physical and mechanical properties to formulate modified-release multiparticulates to be embedded in orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs). The targeted polymer should have adequate elastic-plastic properties in a multiparticulate system during the manufacturing process, which is affected by its physical properties. The good mechanical properties of the multiparticulate system can effectively aid in retaining the shape of the particles from being affected under applied compression pressure during the formulation process and tablets preparations. Therefore, the formulation should have good mechanical attains. Five polymers (three natural and two synthetic), namely: sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), methylcellulose (MC), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and Eudragit L100, were evaluated. Polymers in raw form or particle engineered using spray drying were characterised using different analysis techniques: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), compacts tensile strength, texture analysis, particle size analysis and surface area analysis. The unprocessed PAA exhibited the lowest Young's modulus, measuring at 5.38 MPa, whereas MC displayed the highest value of 14.74 MPa. The polymers were subjected to spray drying at a concentration of 5 % w/v. Data of the texture analysis revealed that Young's modulus increased for the spray-dried PAA powder, reaching 13.69 MPa. This suggests an enhanced polymer compressibility subsequent to the spray drying process. Eudragit L100 demonstrated an enhanced tabletability prolife after spray drying. SEM and surface area results showed a correlation with the mechanical findings. Plasticity and elasticity together provide strong, durable tablets with structural integrity. Achieving a balance between these properties is crucial for effective tabletability. The results of this study provide an insight into physical and mechanical properties and changes encountered upon spray drying. A balance between elastic-plastic properties is required for optimal multiparticulate development.","Al-Hashimi N., Dahmash E.Z., Khoder M., Alany R.G., Elshaer A.",10.1016/j.jddst.2024.106302,Journal Of Drug Delivery Science And Technology
Combined Effects Of Polyvinyl Chloride Or Polypropylene Microplastics With Cadmium On The Intestine Of Zebrafish At Environmentally Relevant Concentrations,"Cadmium (Cd) is a common additive in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) plastics. Aquatic organisms were inevitably co-exposed to PVC/PP microplastics (MPs) and Cd, but their combined toxicity is still unknown. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to 200 μg/L MPs (PVC or PP) and 10 μg/L Cd alone or in combination for 28 days to investigate their toxicity and mechanisms. Results showed that combined exposure with PVC/PP enhanced the Cd accumulation in the zebrafish intestine. Subsequently, toxicology analyses showed that both PVC and PP possessed synergistic toxicity with Cd, manifested by the exfoliation and necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, and increased levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). PP exhibited a stronger synergistic effect than PVC. Integration of non-targeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that combined exposure to PVC and Cd induced intestine toxicity mainly through bile acid (BA) biosynthesis, fructose (Fru) and mannose (Man) metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The combined exposure of PP and Cd induced toxicity through the arginine (Arg) and glutathione (GSH) metabolisms. Meanwhile, combined exposure of PVC/PP and Cd increased the abundance of intestinal Proteobacteria and pathogen Vibrio, and decreased the abundance of Gemmobacter. These changes indrectly promoted the synergistic toxicity of PVC/PP and Cd through metabolites, such as indole-3-pyruvate (IPyA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and cholic acid (CA). These findings highlighted that more attention should be paid to the toxicity of chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations, particularly those co-existing with MPs.","Li H., Yang Z., Liu Y., Sun P., Wu B., Chen L.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176289,Science Of The Total Environment
Acquired Nf2 Mutation Confers Resistance To Trk Inhibition In An Ex Vivo Lmna::Ntrk1-Rearranged Soft-Tissue Sarcoma Cell Model,"Genomic rearrangements of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase genes (NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3) are the most common mechanism of oncogenic activation for this family of receptors, resulting in sustained cancer cell proliferation. Several targeted therapies have been approved for tumours harbouring NTRK fusions and a new generation of TRK inhibitors has already been developed due to acquired resistance. We established a patient-derived LMNA::NTRK1-rearranged soft-tissue sarcoma cell model ex vivo with an acquired resistance to targeted TRK inhibition. Molecular profiling of the resistant clones revealed an acquired NF2 loss of function mutation that was absent in the parental cell model. Parental cells showed continuous sensitivity to TRK-targeted treatment, whereas the resistant clones were insensitive. Furthermore, resistant clones showed upregulation of the MAPK and mTOR/AKT pathways in the gene expression based on RNA sequencing data and increased sensitivity to MEK and mTOR inhibitor therapy. Drug synergy was seen using trametinib and rapamycin in combination with entrectinib. Medium-throughput drug screening further identified small compounds as potential drug candidates to overcome resistance as monotherapy or in combination with entrectinib. In summary, we developed a comprehensive model of drug resistance in an LMNA::NTRK1-rearranged soft-tissue sarcoma and have broadened the understanding of acquired drug resistance to targeted TRK therapy. Furthermore, we identified drug combinations and small compounds to overcome acquired drug resistance and potentially guide patient care in a functional precision oncology setting. © 2024 The Authors.

Size-Dependent Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastics On Gut Metagenome And Antibiotic Resistance In C57Bl/6 Mice,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat for marine and terrestrial ecosystems, which has raised global concerns about its implications for human health. Mounting evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays a key role in human health and diseases. The gut bacteria could be disturbed by many environmental factors, including the microplastic particles. However, the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on mycobiome, as well as gut functional metagenome has not been well studied. In this study, we performed ITS sequencing to explore the size effect of polystyrene microplastics on the fungal composition, in combination with the shotgun metagenomics sequencing to reveal the size effects of polystyrene on the functional metagenome. We found that polystyrene microplastic particles with 0.05–0.1 µm diameter showed greater impact on the bacterial and fungal composition of gut microbiota as well as the metabolic pathways than the polystyrene microplastic particles with 9–10 µm diameter. Our results suggested that size-depended effects should not be ignored in the health risk assessment of microplastics.","Gao B., Shi X., Li S., Xu W., Gao N., Shan J., Shen W.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114737,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Drug Resistance In Cancers: A Free Pass For Bullying,"The cancer burden continues to grow globally, and drug resistance remains a substantial challenge in cancer therapy. It is well established that cancerous cells with clonal dysplasia generate the same carcinogenic lesions. Tumor cells pass on genetic templates to subsequent generations in evolutionary terms and exhibit drug resistance simply by accumulating genetic alterations. However, recent evidence has implied that tumor cells accumulate genetic alterations by progressively adapting. As a result, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is generated due to genetically distinct subclonal populations of cells coexisting. The genetic adaptive mechanisms of action of ITH include activating “cellular plasticity”, through which tumor cells create a tumor-supportive microenvironment in which they can proliferate and cause increased damage. These highly plastic cells are located in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and undergo extreme changes to resist therapeutic drugs. Accordingly, the underlying mechanisms involved in drug resistance have been re-evaluated. Herein, we will reveal new themes emerging from initial studies of drug resistance and outline the findings regarding drug resistance from the perspective of the TME; the themes include exosomes, metabolic reprogramming, protein glycosylation and autophagy, and the relates studies aim to provide new targets and strategies for reversing drug resistance in cancers.","Li J., Li X., Guo Q.",10.3390/cells11213383,Cells
"Incidence, Risk Factors And Outcome Of Multi-Drug Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Nosocomial Infections During An Outbreak In A Burn Unit","Background: Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MR-AB) can cause outbreaks in burn units. We aimed to study the incidence, risk factors and outcome of MR-AB infections in a burn unit (BU). Methods: A prospective study was conducted from April to November, 2014 during an outbreak in a BU in Paris. Weekly surveillance cultures were performed to determine MR-AB colonization. MR-AB nosocomial infections, discharge or death without MR-AB infection were considered as competing events. To identify risk factors for MR-AB infection, baseline characteristics and time-dependent variables were investigated in univariate analyses using Cox models. Results: Eighty-six patients admissions were analyzed during the study period. Among them, 15 (17%) acquired MR-AB nosocomial infection. Median time to infection was 22 days (interquartile range: 10–26 days). Cumulative incidence of MR-AB infections was 15% at 28 days (95% CI = 8–24). Risk factors for MR-AB infection in univariate analysis were SAPS II (Hazard Ratio (HR):1.08; 95% CI:1.05–1.12; P < 0.0001) and ABSI (Abbreviated Burn Severity Index) scores (HR:1.32; 95% CI:1.12–1.56; P = 0.001), MR-AB colonization (HR:10.2; 95%CI:2.05–50.3; P = 0.004), invasive procedures (ventilation, arterial and/or venous catheter) (P = 0.0001) and ≥2 skin grafts (HR:10.2; 95% CI:1.76–59.6; P = 0.010). MR-AB infection was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 7.11; 95%CI: 1.52–33.2; P = 0.013) and longer hospital stay with a median estimated increase of 10 days (IQR: 6; 14). Conclusions: Incidence of MR-AB nosocomial infection was high during this outbreak, and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of death. High patient severity scores, prior MR-AB colonization, invasive procedures and repeated skin grafts were associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infection.","Munier A.-L., Biard L., Legrand M., Rousseau C., Lafaurie M., Donay J.-L., Flicoteaux R., Mebazaa A., Mimoun M., Molina J.-M.",10.1016/j.ijid.2018.11.371,International Journal Of Infectious Diseases
Between Source And Sea: The Role Of Wastewater Treatment In Reducing Marine Microplastics,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a focal point for the removal of microplastic (MP) particles before they are discharged into aquatic environments. WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 μm, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers.","Freeman S., Booth A.M., Sabbah I., Tiller R., Dierking J., Klun K., Rotter A., Ben-David E., Javidpour J., Angel D.L.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110642,Journal Of Environmental Management
Increased Capsule Thickness And Hypermotility Are Traits Of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii St3 Strains Causing Fulminant Infection,"Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is a successful nosocomial pathogen, causing severe, life-threatening infections in hospitalized patients, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections. The spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) strains is a major health threat worldwide. The successful spread of CRAB is mostly due to its highly plastic genome. Although some virulence factors associated with CRAB have been uncovered, many mechanisms contributing to its success are not fully understood. Methods: Here we describe strains of CRAB that were isolated from fulminant cases in 2 hospitals in Israel. These isolates show a rare hypermucoid (HM) phenotype and were investigated using phenotypic assays, comparative genomics, and an in vivo Galleria mellonella model. Results: The 3 isolates belonged to the ST3 international clonal type and were closely related to each other, as shown by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and phylogenetic analyses. These isolates possessed thickened capsules and a dense filamentous extracellular polysaccharides matrix as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and overexpressed the capsule polysaccharide synthesis pathway-related wzc gene. Conclusions: The HM isolates possessed a unique combination of virulence genes involved in iron metabolism, protein secretion, adherence, and membrane glycosylation. HM strains were more virulent than control strains in 2 G. mellonella infection models. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated several virulence factors, all present in 3 CRAB isolates with rare hypermucoid phenotypes.","Rakovitsky N., Lellouche J., Ben David D., Frenk S., Elmalih P., Weber G., Kon H., Schwartz D., Wolfhart L., Temkin E., Carmeli Y.",10.1093/ofid/ofab386,Open Forum Infectious Diseases
Point-Of-Care Diagnostics For Drugs Of Abuse In Biological Fluids: Application Of A Microfabricated Disposable Copper Potentiometric Sensor,"The major objective of this work was to develop a portable, disposable, cost-effective, and reliable POC solid-state electrochemical sensor based on potentiometric transduction to detect benzodiazepine abuse, mainly diazepam (DZP), in biological fluids. To achieve that, microfabricated Cu electrodes on a printed circuit board modified with the conducting polymer poly(3-octylthiophene) (POT) have been employed as a substrate. This polymer was introduced to enhance the stability of the potential drift (0.9 mV/h) and improve the limit of detection (0.126 nmol mL-1). Nernstian potentiometric response was achieved for DZP over the concentration range 1.0 × 10-2 to 5.0 × 10-7 mol L-1 with a slope of 55.0 ± 0.4 mV/decade and E0 ~ 478.9 ± 0.9. Intrinsic merits of the proposed sensor include rapid response time (11 ± 2 s) and long life time (3 months). In order to enhance the selectivity of the potentiometric sensor towards the target drug and minimize any false positive results, calix[4]arene (CX4) was impregnated as an ionophore within the PVC plastic ion-sensing membrane. The performance of the POC sensors was assessed using electrochemical methods of analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as a surface characterization tool. The studied sensors were applied to the potentiometric determination of DZP in different biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, and human milk) in the presence of its metabolite with an average recovery of 100.9 ± 1.3%, 99.4 ± 1.0%, 101.8 ± 1.2%, and 99.0 ± 2.0%, respectively.

Objectives: We aim to describe the abnormalities in sink drains found in a new build hospital.We discuss how improvements could be made in future design and the importance of addressing human behaviour in mitigating risk from drains. Methods: Drains were investigated following reports of relux of material back up into sinks by staff and patient infections. Drain components were removed for inspection and analysis by the laboratory. Assessment of biofilm reaction, bacterial burden and chemical analysis of drain debris was undertaken. Results: Drains were found not to be flush with the back of the sink with a lip present where water was stagnating. Excess sealant was present in the drains and there was corrosion of an aluminium component. Several plastic objects were retrieved and some scrub sinks were completely occluded by surgeons nail picks. Mature biofilm and high bacterial counts were detected along with evidence of nutrients in the drains. Conclusion: Several problems with drain design and installation were identified. Firstly the drain was not contiguous with the back of the sink which promoted stagnation and pooling of water. Excess sealant present in the drain led to occlusion and further excacerbated stagnation as the drain was not free flowing. Corrosion and splitting of an aluminimum spigot enhanced the occlusion and provided an uneven damaged surface for bacteria to adhere to. Together these conditions promoted biofilm formation,excacerabted by the presence of foreign material and nutirients. There are several lessions from these findings that should be applied to future design of drains. 1) The drain should be completlely flush with the back of the sink 2) Overzealous use of sealant should be avoided as this can lead to obstruction and poor flow 3) Components used in drains should be with a material not liable to corrosion 4) Workmanship should be of a high standard. It is also important to address behavioural aspects and infection control teams should ensure staff/ patients are aware of the importance of drain hygiene. Objects and fluids should not be decanted in drains and alternative disposal methods should be provided.","Inkster T., Weinbren M.",10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
The Tumor-Associated Fibrotic Reactions In Microenvironment Aggravate Glioma Chemoresistance,"Malignant gliomas are one of the most common and lethal brain tumors with poor prognosis. Most patients with glioblastoma (GBM) die within 2 years of diagnosis, even after receiving standard treatments including surgery combined with concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for gliomas, but the frequent acquisition of chemoresistance generally leads to its treatment failure. Thus, it’s urgent to investigate the strategies for overcoming glioma chemoresistance. Currently, many studies have elucidated that cancer chemoresistance is not only associated with the high expression of drug-resistance genes in glioma cells but also can be induced by the alterations of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Numerous studies have explored the use of antifibrosis drugs to sensitize chemotherapy in solid tumors, and surprisingly, these preclinical and clinical attempts have exhibited promising efficacy in treating certain types of cancer. However, it remains unclear how tumor-associated fibrotic alterations in the glioma microenvironment (GME) mediate chemoresistance. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon are yet to be determined. In this review, we have summarized the molecular mechanisms by which tumor-associated fibrotic reactions drive glioma transformation from a chemosensitive to a chemoresistant state. Additionally, we have outlined antitumor drugs with antifibrosis functions, suggesting that antifibrosis strategies may be effective in overcoming glioma chemoresistance through TME normalization.","Xu J., Zhang J., Chen W., Ni X.",10.3389/fonc.2024.1388700,Frontiers In Oncology
A Novel Polyurethane-Based Silver Foam Dressing With Superior Antimicrobial Action For Management Of Infected Chronic Wounds,"Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process supported by several cellular events. Around 13 million individuals globally suffer from chronic wounds yearly, for which dressings with excellent antimicrobial activity and cell viability (>70%, as per ISO 10993) are needed. Excessive use of silver can cause cytotoxicity and has been linked to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this study, HDI Ag foam was synthesized using a safer hexamethylene diisocyanate-based prepolymer (HDI prepolymer) instead of commonly used diisocyanates like TDI and MDI and substantially lower Ag content than that incorporated in other Ag foams. In vitro characteristics of the HDI Ag foam were evaluated in comparison with leading clinically used foam-based dressings. All dressings underwent a detailed characterization in accordance with industrially accepted BS EN 13726 standards. The HDI Ag foam exhibited highest antimicrobial efficiency againstS. aureusandP. aeruginosa(static condition), with the lowest amount of Ag (0.2 wt%) on the wound contact surface. The extracts from HDI Ag foam showed superior cell viability (>70%), when tested on the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. Measurements of moisture vapor transmission, fluid handling, physico-chemical and mechanical properties ensured that the HDI foam was clinically acceptable for chronic wound patients.","Rajput J.H., Rathi V., Mukherjee A., Yadav P., Gupta T., Das B., Poundarik A.",10.1088/1748-605X/ad8fe8,"Biomedical Materials (Bristol, England)"
"Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-Positive Melanoma Stem Cells In Tumorigenesis, Drug Resistance And Anti-Neoplastic Immunotherapy","Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare subset of cancer cells, are well known for their self-renewing capacity. CSCs play a critical role in therapeutic failure and are responsible for poor prognosis in leukemia and various solid tumors. However, it is still unclear how CSCs initiate carcinogenesis and evade the immune response. In humans, the melanoma initiating cells (MICs) are recognized as the CSCs in melanomas, and were verified to possess CSC potentials. The enzymatic system, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is considered to be a specific marker for CSCs in several tumors. The expression of ALDH in MICs may be closely correlated with phenotypic heterogeneity, melanoma-genesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The ALDH(+) CSCs/MICs not only serve as an indicator for therapeutic efficacy, but have also become a target for the treat of melanoma. In this review, we initially introduce the multiple capacities of MICs in melanoma. Then, we summarize in vivo and in vitro studies that illustrate the relationship between ALDH and MICs. Furthermore, understanding of chemotherapy resistance in melanoma relies on ALDH(+) MICs. Finally, we review studies that focus on melanoma immunotherapies, rendering ALDH a potential marker to evaluate the efficacy of anti-neoplastic therapies or an adjuvant anti-melanoma target.","Zhang S., Yang Z., Qi F.",10.1007/s11033-019-05227-2,Molecular Biology Reports
A High-Throughput Screening Model Of The Tumor Microenvironment For Ovarian Cancer Cell Growth,"The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the processes of tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. We have used a multilayered 3D primary cell culture model that reproduces the human ovarian cancer metastatic microenvironment to study the effect of the microenvironment on the pharmacological responses of different classes of drugs on cancer cell proliferation. A collection of oncology drugs was screened to identify compounds that inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells growing as monolayers or forming spheroids, on plastic and on a 3D microenvironment culture model of the omentum metastatic site, and also cells already in preformed spheroids. Target-based analysis of the pharmacological responses revealed that several classes of targets were more efficacious in cancer cells growing in the absence of the metastatic microenvironment, and other target classes were less efficacious in cancer cells in preformed spheres compared to forming spheroid cultures. These findings show that both the cellular context of the tumor microenvironment and cell adhesion mode have an essential role in cancer cell drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to perform screens for new drugs using model systems that more faithfully recapitulate the tissue composition at the site of tumor growth and metastasis.","Lal-Nag M., Mcgee L., Guha R., Lengyel E., Kenny H.A., Ferrer M.",10.1177/2472555216687082,Slas Discovery
The Emerging Role Of Exosomes In Cancer Chemoresistance,"Chemoresistance is an impending challenge in cancer treatment. In recent years, exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 40–150 nm in bloodstream and other bio-fluids, have attracted increasing interest. Exosomes contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which act as important signaling molecules. Many reports indicate that exosomes play critical roles in chemoresistance through intercellular interactions, including drug removal from cells, transfer of drug resistance phenotypes to other cancer cells, and the increase in plastic stem cell subsets. Exosomes can reflect the physiological and pathological state of parent cells. Owing to their elevated stability, specificity, and sensitivity, exosomes are served as biomarkers in liquid biopsies to monitor cancer chemoresistance, progression, and recurrence. This review summarizes the exosome-mediated mechanisms of cancer chemoresistance, as well as its role in reversing and monitoring chemoresistance. The scientific and technological challenges and future applications of exosomes are also explored.","Li J., Gao N., Gao Z., Liu W., Pang B., Dong X., Li Y., Fan T.",10.3389/fcell.2021.737962,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Partial Emt In Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Snapshot,"In the process of cancer EMT, some subgroups of cancer cells simultaneously exhibit both mesenchymal and epithelial characteristics, a phenomenon termed partial EMT (pEMT). pEMT is a plastic state in which cells coexpress epithelial and mesenchymal markers. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pEMT is regulated, and the phenotype is maintained via the HIPPO pathway, NOTCH pathway and TGF-β pathways and by microRNAs, lncRNAs and the cancer microenvironment (CME); thus, SCC exhibits aggressive tumorigenic properties and high stemness, which leads collective migration and therapy resistance. Few studies have reported therapeutic interventions to address cells that have undergone pEMT, and this approach may be an effective way to inhibit the plasticity, drug resistance and metastatic potential of SCC.","Liao C., Wang Q., An J., Long Q., Wang H., Xiang M., Xiang M., Zhao Y., Liu Y., Liu J., Guan X.",10.7150/ijbs.61566,International Journal Of Biological Sciences
Presence Of Listeria Monocytogenes In Ready-To-Eat Meat Products Sold At Retail Stores In Costa Rica And Analysis Of Contributing Factors,"ABSTRACT: Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium associated with ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products sold at the retail level. The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products sold at retail in Costa Rica and to study the factors associated with the levels of contamination; analyzed factors include hygienic practices within stores (cutting techniques and microbial contamination of products) and the behavior of the isolates (persistence against antimicrobials and transfer potential). A total of 190 samples of RTE meat products were collected and analyzed for the presence of coliforms and Listeria spp. Isolates of L. monocytogenes were then evaluated in terms of resistance to disinfectants (quaternary ammonium compound [QAC] and chlorine) and their transfer potential from food contact surfaces (knife and cutting boards). Overall Listeria spp. prevalence was 37.4% (71 of 190); Listeria innocua was present in 32.1% (61 of 190) of the products, and L. monocytogenes was found in just 2.6% (5 of 190) of the samples. Most contaminated samples were cut with a knife at the moment of purchase (44.2%). When analyzing practices within the stores, it was observed that L. monocytogenes transfer from inoculated knife to salchichón was higher for samples cut at the beginning of the experiment. In addition, L. monocytogenes transfer from inoculated cutting boards was independent of the number of slices but contamination from plastic was higher than wood. Regarding L. monocytogenes resistance to disinfectants, average reductions of 2.6 ± 1.1 log CFU/mL were detected after 6 min of exposure to 200 ppm of chlorine; however, chlorine resistance varied among the strains. Prevalence of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products sold at retail could be associated with handling practices within the stores; further studies are necessary to estimate the impact of these practices on the overall risk for consumers.","Calvo-Arrieta K., Matamoros-Montoya K., Arias-Echandi M.L., Huete-Soto A., Redondo-Solano M.",10.4315/JFP-21-020,Journal Of Food Protection
An Outbreak Of Candida Parapsilosis Bloodstream Infections In Pediatric Oncohemathology Unit,"Introduction: The Candida spp is one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections (BSI) in immunocompromised hosts. Their ability of biofilm formation on different implants facilitate the catheterassociated infections. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate an outbreak of bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients with totally implantable venous access port systems. Methods: A total of 36 episodes of port system-related bloodstream infections were registered and investigated in 11 patients between January and May, 2021. Blood cultures, needles, saline solutions, i.v. plastic lines,bags, staff hands samples sent to microbiology lab. The Candida spp. isolation on SDA. The isolates identification by VITEK 2, BioMerieux and api20CAUX, BioMerieux, France. Re-identified by MALDI-TOF (MALDI-Biotyper, Bruker. Whole genome sequencing was prepared in the National Reference Lab. Results: The data from patients notes shows that all patients were neutropenic and with fever at the time of blood cultures and candidemia diagnosis Six of all patient had one sepsis episode each. Five of them had three or four sepsis episodes, mostly in March and May, 2021. The all blood cultures isolates as well as needles' isolates were identified as Candida parapsilosis. In the cases of five patients with persistent candidemia and ongoing fever, additionally to antifungal therapy, the ports were removed, based on the international guidelines and manufacturer's instructions. Various gaps in the Infection Prevention and control practices were found: poor hand hygiene compliance, shortage of staff and incidents of using a common saline solution bottle etc. Conclusion: The totally implantable port systems represent a high risk of bloodstream infections complications in pediatric onco-hematology patients. The healthcare workers hands can be a risk factor for contamination with Candida parapsilosis. Further work need to create a special bundle and develop strategic measures for infection prevention and control of infections in case of totally implantable venous access port systems as well as a medical staff training programme.","Vatcheva-Dobrevska R., Stefanova P., Dicheva V., Philipova I., Kantardjiev T.",10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Long-Term Outcome Of Phrenic Nerve Transfer In Brachial Plexus Avulsion Injuries,"INTRODUCTION: In brachial plexus injuries, useful recovery of arm function has been documented in most patients after phrenic nerve transfer after variable follow-up durations, but there is not much information about long-term functional outcomes. In addition, there is still some concern that respiratory complications might become manifest with aging. The aim of this study was to report the outcome of phrenic nerve transfer after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were reviewed and evaluated clinically. Age at surgery averaged 25.2 years and follow-up averaged 9.15 years. RESULTS: Shoulder abduction and external rotation achieved by transfer of phrenic to axillary nerve (or posterior division of upper trunk), combined with spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer, were better than that achieved by transfer of phrenic to suprascapular nerve, combined with grafting the posterior division of upper trunk from C5, 52.3 and 45.5 degrees versus 47.5 and 39.4 degrees, respectively. There was no difference in abduction when the phrenic nerve was transferred directly to the posterior division of upper trunk or to the axillary nerve using nerve graft. Elbow flexion (≥M3 MRC) was achieved in 5 (83.3%) of 6 cases. Elbow extension M4 MRC or greater was achieved in 4 (66.6%) of 6 cases. All patients, including those who exceeded the age of 45 years and those who had concomitant intercostal nerve transfer, continued to have no respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term follow-up confirms the safety and effectiveness and of phrenic nerve transfer for functional restoration of shoulder and elbow functions in brachial plexus avulsion injuries.","El-Gammal T.A., El-Sayed A., Kotb M.M., Abdel-Hamid U.F., El-Gammal Y.T.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000002611,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Microrna-488-3P Sensitizes Malignant Melanoma Cells To Cisplatin By Targeting Prkdc,"Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in drug resistance in various types of cancers, including malignant melanoma (MM). MiR-488-3p has been reported as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. However, the exact expression patterns of miR-488-3p and the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its role in MM remain largely unknown and require further investigation. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-488-3p is significantly downregulated in MM clinical specimens and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-488-3p resulted in markedly increased drug sensitivity of MM cells in vitro and in vivo. The DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC), which encodes DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), was identified as a direct target of miR-488-3p using luciferase reporter assays, qRT-PCR, and western blotting analyses. PRKDC knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) alone promoted sensitivity of MM cells to cisplatin (DDP) while overexpression of PRKDC partially rescued the miR-488-3p-mediated acceleration of sensitivity to DDP in MM cells. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-488-3p serves as a drug resistance sensitizer in MM, supporting its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate.","Li N., Ma Y., Ma L., Guan Y., Ma L., Yang D.",10.1002/cbin.10765,Cell Biology International
Assessing The Burden And Trends Of Healthcare Associated Infection In A Tertiary Care Hospital Through Point Prevalence Survey,"Introduction: To obtain basic Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) information, such as prevalence, isolated pathogens and type of HAI, cross-sectional survey is a relatively cost-effective method. Repeated cross sectional surveys can also provide meaningful data to investigate potential trends of HAIs. Objectives: To understand HAI epidemiology and to improve infection control program, four annual point prevalence surveys were conducted from 2012 to 2016. Methods: Settting - 1531 bedded, tertiary care, government hospital with 8 ICUs and 41 wards (21 clinical departments) We conducted 4 annual point prevalence surveys on HAI from 2012 to 2016. Before the survey, the questionnaires and definitions of the investigated variables in the questionnaire were circulated to all linked-nurses. On the day of survey, all in- patients were surveyed and questionnaires were completed. The data was extracted from all relevant sources including clinical records, temperature charts, laboratory reports and radiographs. Trained Infection control nurses reviewed medical records retrospectively to identify HAIs active at the time of the survey. Results: A total of 5194 patients were included (1229 patients in 2012, 1447 in 2014, 1311 in 2015 and 1207 in 2016). Overall prevalence of HAI showed a decreasing trend over 4 years (7.4, 5.3, 8.8, & 5.9% respectively). Most departments have HAI rate varying between 0 and 10% except ICUs (44-62%) and burn & plastic wards (22-27%). Wound infections (41-47%) are the most common HAI in all the years. The rate of UTI has an upward trend (23, 12, 24 & 38% respectively) while rate of BSI has downward trend (15, 18, 11& 5% respectively). Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli, Klebsiella & Acinetobacter) are most isolated pathogens. There is increased rate of isolation of E.coli (15, 11, 21 & 25% respectively) and Acinetobacter (18, 10,13 &19% respectively) while decreased rate of isolation of S.aureus (15,16,13 & 4% respectively) over the years. Conclusion: Despite the limitations of Point prevalence survey, our study yielded valuable data on the epidemiology of HAI. The study underscore the surveillance of HAI by repeated prevalence surveys for a better understanding of trends in the epidemiology of HAIs and prevention success.","Saksena R., Kumar S., Gaind R., Nagpal S., Suri P.",10.1186/s13756-017-0201-4,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Facile Construction Of Antimicrobial Surface Via One-Step Co-Deposition Of Peptide Polymer And Dopamine,"The infections associated with implantable medical devices can greatly affect the therapeutic effect and impose a heavy financial burden. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for the prevention and mitigation of healthcare-associated infections. Here, a facile construction of antimicrobial surface via one-step co-deposition of peptide polymer and dopamine is reported. The co-deposition of antimicrobial peptide polymer DLL(60)BLG(40) with dopamine (DA) on the surface of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) provides peptide polymer-modified TPU surface (TPU-DLL(60)BLG(40)). The antimicrobial test shows that the TPU-DLL(60)BLG(40) surfaces of the sheet and the catheter both exhibit potent killing of 99.9% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). In addition, the TPU-DLL(60)BLG(40) surface also exhibits excellent biocompatibility. This one-step antimicrobial modification method is fast and efficient, implies promising application in surface antimicrobial modification of implantable biomaterials and medical devices.","Wu Y., She Y., Yan Z., Chen S., Wang J., Dong A., Wang J., Liu R.",10.1002/mabi.202300327,Macromolecular Bioscience
Graphene Oxide/Black Phosphorus Functionalized Collagen Scaffolds With Enhanced Near-Infrared Controlled In Situ Biomineralization For Promoting Infectious Bone Defect Repair Through Pi3K/Akt Pathway,"Infectious bone defects resulting from surgery, infection, or trauma are a prevalent clinical issue. Current treatments commonly used include systemic antibiotics and autografts or allografts. Nevertheless, therapies come with various disadvantages, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, complications arising from the donor site, and immune rejection, which makes artificial implants desirable. However, artificial implants can fail due to bacterial infections and inadequate bone fusion after implantation. Thus, the development of multifunctional bone substitutes that are biocompatible, antibacterial, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive would be of great clinical importance. This study designs and prepares 2D graphene oxide (GO) and black phosphorus (BP) reinforced porous collagen (Col) scaffolds as a viable strategy for treating infectious bone defects. The fabricated Col-GO@BP scaffold exhibited an efficient photothermal antibacterial effect under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. A further benefit of the NIR-controlled degradation of BP was to promote biomineralization by phosphorus-driven and calcium-extracted phosphorus in situ. The abundant functional groups in GO could synergistically capture the ions and enhance the in situ biomineralization. The Col-GO@BP scaffold facilitated osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) by leveraging its mild photothermal effect and biomineralization process, which upregulated heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activated PI3K/Akt pathways. Additionally, systematic in vivo experiments demonstrated that the Col-GO@BP scaffold obviously promotes infectious bone repair through admirable photothermal antibacterial performance and enhanced vascularization. As a result of this study, we provide new insights into the photothermal activity of GO@BP nanosheets, their degradation, and a new biological application for them.","Chen X., Sun Z., Peng X., Meng N., Ma L., Fu J., Chen J., Liu Y., Yang Y., Zhou C.",10.1021/acsami.4c10284,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Magnesium Hydroxide Nanoparticles Modified Collagen/Silk Fibroin Composite Scaffold For Infected Wound Healing,"INTRODUCTION: Infected wound induced by pathogenic bacteria have caused considerable threats to global health. Antibiotics have been widely used as the traditional treatments for infected wound, while the improper utilization has led to multidrug-resistant bacteria. Wound dressings constructed with sponge porous scaffolds have been applied to managing infected wound. Natural polymers represented by collagen (Col) and silk fibroin (SF) have been widely used in constructing wound dressings due to their wide sources, strong mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, weak angiogenesis ability and poor antibacterial properties hander their further applications. Magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg(OH)2) have been considered ecofriendly nanomaterials with excellent antibacterial activity, low toxicity, and good biocompatibility. Therefore, we infer that it is possible to construct Mg(OH)2-Col-SF porous scaffolds to promote the repair of infected wounds. METHODS: In this study, bioactive natural polymers such as collagen and silk fibroin were used as the main raw materials, supplemented by Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles to enhance antibacterial properties. Mg(OH)2 was prepared by one-pot mixing, freeze-drying, and cross-linking methods. The fabricated Mg(OH)2-Col-SF porous scaffolds were characterized by physicochemical properties, biocompatibility and antibacterial properties in vitro. Then the rat infected wound model was constructed, and the healing effects were evaluated by gross photo and histological staining. RESULTS: The fabricated Mg(OH)2-Col-SF scaffold has a loose and porous structure under SEM. Good mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and water absorption were observed. Furthermore, good antibacterial effects towards Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were observed. Cell experiments showed the Mg(OH)2-Col-SF scaffold could promote proliferation of fibroblasts. In addition, Mg (OH)2-Col-SF scaffold exhibited good antibacterial activity, low toxicity, and accelerated wound repair effects in vivo. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The Mg(OH)2-Col-SF scaffold was successfully prepared in this study, which has good mechanical properties, antibacterial, and can accelerate the repair of infected wounds. The possible mechanism lie on the promoted angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, and accelerated collagen deposition.","Xiong S., Zhou C., Yang Y.",10.1089/ten.tea.2023.29043.abstracts,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Engineered Phage With Aggregation-Induced Emission Photosensitizer In Cocktail Therapy Against Sepsis,"Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, a novel strategy combining the aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE-PS) TBTCP-PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment is proposed. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE-PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows a strong ""1 + 1 > 2"" bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point-of-care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.","Wu M.-Y., Chen L., Chen Q., Hu R., Xu X., Wang Y., Li J., Feng S., Dong C., Zhang X.-L., Li Z., Wang L., Chen S., Gu M.",10.1002/adma.202208578,"Advanced Materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)"
Efficacy Of A New Non-Drug Acne Therapy: Aloe Vera Gel Combined With Ultrasound And Soft Mask For The Treatment Of Mild To Severe Facial Acne,"Background: Acne is a chronic disorder that affects almost 80% of adolescents and young adults, causing psychological and emotional distress. However, the current treatments for acne are either ineffective or have many side effects. This study was designed to confirm and objectively quantify the effect of a new non-drug combined therapy on acne. Methods: This study innovatively utilized ultrasound, which enhanced the absorption of aloe vera gel, and soft mask to make a purely physical method without any drugs. In both the treatment group and control group, the number of papules/pustules and the area of hyperpigmented lesions were counted, and a smart mirror intelligent face system was used before and after the combined therapy. Alterations in the skin functional index were recorded and analyzed statistically. Results: In the treatment group, the combined therapy significantly reduced the number of papules and the area of hyperpigmented lesions and improved skin roughness and local blood circulation. In the control group, there was no obvious improvement over 2 months. Conclusion: This study suggests that the new non-drug combined therapy significantly improved acne, which provided experimental evidence and treatment guidance for patients with mild to severe acne, especially patients with moderate acne. This new therapy may possibly be an appropriate method for patients who seek topical treatments with mild side effects and low antibiotic resistance rates.","Zhong H., Li X., Zhang W., Shen X., Lu Y., Li H.",10.3389/fmed.2021.662640,Frontiers In Medicine

Emerging Contaminants And Their Potential Impacts On Estuarine Ecosystems: Are We Aware Of It?,"Emerging contaminants (ECs) are becoming more prevalent in estuaries and constitute a danger to both human health and ecosystems. These pollutants can infiltrate the ecosystem and spread throughout the food chain. Because of the diversified sources and extensive human activities, estuaries are particularly susceptible to increased pollution levels. A thorough review on recent ECs (platinum group elements, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides, siloxanes, liquid crystal monomers, cationic surfactant, antibiotic resistance genes, and microplastics) in estuaries, including their incidence, detection levels, and toxic effects, was performed. The inclusion of studies from different regions highlights the global nature of this issue, with each location having its unique set of contaminants. The diverse range of contaminants detected in estuary samples worldwide underscores the intricacy of ECs. A significant drawback is the scarcity of research on the toxic mechanisms of ECs on estuarine organisms, the prospect of unidentified ECs, warrant research scopes.","Sultan M.B., Anik A.H., Rahman M.M.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115982,Marine Pollution Bulletin
Microplastics Aggravate The Bioaccumulation Of Two Waterborne Veterinary Antibiotics In An Edible Bivalve Species: Potential Mechanisms And Implications For Human Health,"Edible bivalves are one of the major types of seafood and may be subject to antibiotic and microplastics (MPs) co-exposure under realistic scenarios. However, the effect of MPs on the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in edible bivalves and subsequent health risks for consumers remain poorly understood. Therefore, the bioaccumulation of two frequently detected veterinary antibiotics, oxytetracycline (OTC) and florfenicol (FLO), with or without the co-presence of MPs was investigated in the blood clam. Health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated clams were also assessed. Furthermore, the activity of GST and expression of key detoxification genes were analyzed as well. The bioaccumulation of OTC and FLO in clams was found to be aggravated by MPs. Since the estimated target hazard quotients (THQs) were far less than the critical value, direct toxic effects of consuming contaminated clams are negligible. However, the dietary exposure doses of the human gut microbiota (DEGM) to the antibiotics tested were greater than or similar to corresponding minimum selective concentrations (MSC), indicating a potential antibiotic resistance risk. Moreover, the GST activity and expression of detoxification genes were significantly suppressed by MPs, suggesting that the disruption of detoxification represents one possible explanation for the aggravated bioaccumulation observed here.","Zhou W., Han Y., Tang Y., Shi W., Du X., Sun S., Liu G.",10.1021/acs.est.0c01575,Environmental Science & Technology
Guillain-Barré Syndrome Associated With Resistant Cytomegalovirus Infection After Face Transplantation,"A 39-year-old male, who received a facial allograft (cytomegalovirus [CMV] donor-seropositive, recipient-seronegative), developed multidrug-resistant CMV infection despite valganciclovir prophylaxis (900 mg/day) 6 months post transplantation.

Prevalence Of Multidrug-Resistant Organism In Icu Burns Patients At Tertiary Care Hospital,"Burns carries a high-risk of mortality and morbidity. This with increased chances of drug-resistant infections makes the management complicated. Hence this study was conducted to find out the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in burns patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a tertiary care hospital. A 2-year retrospective study was conducted where burn patients reporting MDRO were included. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 where a P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 97 patients, tissue cultures of 65 patients revealed the presence of MDRO in 27 (27.8%) patients. A male predominance (17, 63.0%) was noted with a mean age of 29.0-year-old. Fire burn (15, 55.6%) was reported to be the most common cause of burn with an average of 29.9% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) involved. MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest organism reported in 12 (44%) patients. The average length of stay (LOS) was noted to be 11.3 days with a mortality rate of 48.1% (overall, in all MDRO’S infections). Patients who reported MDRO showed a tendency for longer hospitalization with a higher risk of mortality as the TBSA increased. However, in presence of other factors in burns like higher TBSA, inhalation injury and lack of advanced skin substitute these mortality figures, and their association can be debated. Lastly, the implementation of control measures, as basic as hand hygiene, should be partaken to reduce the burden of MDR infections.","Buriro F., Ishaque S., Saeed A., Qamar M.A., Batool A.",10.1093/jbcr/irac160,Journal Of Burn Care And Research
Stabilizing Versus Destabilizing The Microtubules: A Double-Edge Sword For An Effective Cancer Treatment Option?,"Microtubules are dynamic and structural cellular components involved in several cell functions, including cell shape, motility, and intracellular trafficking. In proliferating cells, they are essential components in the division process through the formation of the mitotic spindle. As a result of these functions, tubulin and microtubules are targets for anticancer agents. Microtubule-targeting agents can be divided into two groups: microtubule-stabilizing, and microtubule-destabilizing agents. The former bind to the tubulin polymer and stabilize microtubules, while the latter bind to the tubulin dimers and destabilize microtubules. Alteration of tubulin-microtubule equilibrium determines the disruption of the mitotic spindle, halting the cell cycle at the metaphase-anaphase transition and, eventually, resulting in cell death. Clinical application of earlier microtubule inhibitors, however, unfortunately showed several limits, such as neurological and bone marrow toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells. Here we review several natural and synthetic microtubule-targeting agents, which showed antitumor activity and increased efficacy in comparison to traditional drugs in various preclinical and clinical studies. Cryptophycins, combretastatins, ombrabulin, soblidotin, D-24851, epothilones and discodermolide were used in clinical trials. Some of them showed antiangiogenic and antivascular activity and others showed the ability to overcome multidrug resistance, supporting their possible use in chemotherapy.","Fanale D., Bronte G., Passiglia F., Calò V., Castiglia M., Di Piazza F., Barraco N., Cangemi A., Catarella M.T., Insalaco L., Listì A., Maragliano R., Massihnia D., Perez A., Toia F., Cicero G., Bazan V.",10.1155/2015/690916,Analytical Cellular Pathology
Nano-Sized Polystyrene And Magnetite Collectively Promote Biofilm Stability And Resistance Due To Enhanced Oxidative Stress Response,"Despite the growing prevalence of nanoplastics in drinking water distribution systems, the collective influence of nanoplastics and background nanoparticles on biofilm formation and microbial risks remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that nano-sized polystyrene modified with carboxyl groups (nPS) and background magnetite (nFe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles at environmentally relevant concentrations can collectively stimulate biofilm formation and prompt antibiotic resistance. Combined exposure of nPS and nFe(3)O(4) by P. aeruginosa biofilm cells stimulated intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) production more significantly compared with individual exposure. The resultant upregulation of quorum sensing (QS) and c-di-GMP signaling pathways enhanced the biosynthesis of polysaccharides by 50 %− 66 % and increased biofilm biomass by 36 %− 40 % relative to unexposed control. Consistently, biofilm mechanical stability (measured as Young's modulus) increased by 7.2–9.1 folds, and chemical stress resistance (measured with chlorine disinfection) increased by 1.4–2.0 folds. For P. aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentration of different antibiotics also increased by 1.1–2.5 folds after combined exposure. Moreover, at a microbial community-wide level, metagenomic analysis revealed that the combined exposure enhanced the multi-species biofilm's resistance to chlorine, enriched the opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, and promoted their virulence and antibiotic resistance. Overall, the enhanced formation of biofilms (that may harbor opportunistic pathogens) by nanoplastics and background nanoparticles is an overlooked phenomenon, which may jeopardize the microbial safety of drinking water distribution systems.","Wang H., Hu C., Li Y., Shen Y., Guo J., Shi B., Alvarez P.J.J., Yu P.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134974,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Successful Investigational Phage Therapy For Pan-Resistant Bacterial Mediastinitis Following Type Ii Hybrid Aortic Arch Replacement,"A 47-year-old woman presented to our hospital with Stanford type B aortic dissection with retrograde arch extension. The decision was made to undergo hybrid arch repair with thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The patient underwent surgery, but her intraoperative course was complicated by delayed sternal closure and mediastinitis requiring flap reconstruction. Recurrent pan resistant Klebsiella sternal wound infection (SWI) was observed, for which successful investigational bacteriophage therapy initiated through mediastinal drains. She remains infection-free at 2-year follow-up. SWI is a morbid complication following cardiac surgery, particularly when colonized by pan-resistant bacterium. Phage therapy refers to the therapeutic use of modified bacteriophages and have been previously described for use in mediastinitis. We report the use of phage therapy to treat Klebsiella SWI in our patient. This case report adds to the current evidence supporting the use of phage therapy for treatment of complicated mediastinal wound infection following aortic arch surgery.","Hameed I., Ahmed A., Gandhi S., Nassiri N., Steinbacher D.M., Vallabhajosyula P.",10.1016/j.jaccas.2024.102816,Jacc: Case Reports
Dynamic Phenotypic Transition Of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro Revealed By Self-Floating Cell Culture,"Background: Breast tumor heterogeneity leads to phenotypic diversity, such as tumor-initiating and metastatic properties and drug sensitivity. Materials and Methods: We found that a self-floating cell (SFC) culture enriches a drugresistant subpopulation in a HER2-positive breast cancer cell line. SFCs were analyzed for cancer stem cell markers, gene expression profiles, and sensitivity for anticancer drugs. Results: SFCs expressed cancer stem cell markers, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and elevated HER2 autophosphorylation. Gene expression profiles of SFCs showed a dramatic difference compared to those of parental or forced floating cells. SFCs also expressed CD133, a marker of drug resistance, and resisted cytotoxic drugs by drug efflux transporters. In contrast, HER2 kinase inhibitors efficiently reduced SFC viability. Conclusion: SFCs enrich drug-resistant subpopulations even in vitro and might reflect the highly plastic nature of breast cancer cells even in vitro.","Oku Y., Nishiya N., Tsuda K., Shibazaki M., Maesawa C., Uehara Y.",10.21873/anticanres.11513,Anticancer Research
Rapid And Extensive Karyotype Diversification In Haploid Clinical Candida Auris Isolates,"Candida auris is a newly emerged pathogenic microbe, having been identified as a medically relevant fungus as recently as 2009. It is one of the most drug-resistant yeast species known to date and its emergence and population structure are unusual. Because of its recent emergence, we are largely ignorant about fundamental aspects of its general biology, life cycle, and population dynamics. Here, we report the karyotype variability of 26 C. auris strains representing the four main clades. We demonstrate that all strains are haploid and have a highly plastic karyotype containing five to seven chromosomes, which can undergo marked alterations within a short time frame when the fungus is put under genotoxic, heat, or osmotic stress. No simple correlation was found between karyotype pattern, drug resistance, and clade affiliation indicating that karyotype heterogeneity is rapidly evolving. As with other Candida species, these marked karyotype differences between isolates are likely to have an important impact on pathogenic traits of C. auris.","Bravo Ruiz G., Ross Z.K., Holmes E., Schelenz S., Gow N.A.R., Lorenz A.",10.1007/s00294-019-00976-w,Current Genetics
Bioactive Peptide Amphiphile Nanofiber Gels Enhance Burn Wound Healing,"Background: Burns are physically debilitating and potentially fatal injuries. The standard-of-care for burn wounds is the coverage with gauze dressings designed to minimize trauma to the regenerating epidermis and dermis during dressing changes. However, deep partial- and full-thickness burns always heal slowly when standard wound care alone is performed. We have previously reported that peptide amphiphile (PA) gels, pH-induced self-assembling nanostructured fibrous scaffolds, promote cell proliferation and have great potential in regenerative medicine for rapid repair of tissues. In this study, we hypothesized that the PA gels are capable of accelerating wound healing in burn injury. Methods: Artificially generated thermally damaged fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded onto the various PA nanofiber gels including bioactive and nonbioactive peptide sequences. Cell proliferation was assessed at different time points, and thermally damaged fibroblasts and HUVECs manifested increased proliferation with time when cultured with various PA gels. To determine in vivo effects, burn wounds of rats were treated with the bioactive Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS)-modified gel that showed greater cell proliferation in vitro. The wound closure was observed, and skin samples were harvested for histologic evaluation. Results: Cell proliferation using the RGDS-PA gel was significantly higher than that observed in other gels. The RGDS-PA gel significantly enhanced re-epithelialization during the burn wound healing process between days 7 and 28. Application of PA gels accelerates the recovery of deep partial-thickness burn wounds by stimulation of fibroblasts and the creation of an environment conducive to epithelial cell proliferation and wound closure. Conclusions: This biomaterial represents a new therapeutic strategy to overcome current clinical challenges in the treatment of injuries resulting from burns.","Zhou S., Hokugo A., Mcclendon M., Zhang Z., Bakshi R., Wang L., Segovia L.A., Rezzadeh K., Stupp S.I., Jarrahy R.",10.1016/j.burns.2018.06.008,Burns

Effect Of Visible Range Electromagnetic Radiations On Escherichia Coli,"Background: Escherichia coli is the agent responsible for a range of clinical diseases. With emerging antimicrobial resistance, other treatment options including solar/photo-therapy are becoming increasingly common. Visible Range Radiation Therapy/Colour Therapy is an emerging technique in the field of energy/vibrational medicine that uses visible spectrum of Electromagnetic Radiations to cure different diseases. In this study, our goal was to understand the effect of Visible Range Electromagnetic Radiations on E. coli (in vitro) and therefore find out the most appropriate visible range radiation for the treatment of diseases caused by E. coli. Materials and Methods: A total of 6 non-repetitive E. coli isolates were obtained from urine samples obtained from hospitalized patients with UTI. Single colony of E. coli was inoculated in 3 ml of Lysogeny Broth (LB) and 40 μl of this E. coli suspension was poured into each of the plastic tubes which were then irradiated with six different wavelengths in the visible region (Table. 1) after 18 hours with one acting as a control. The Optical Densities of these irradiated samples were then measured. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (TEFCAN ZEGA3) was carried out. Results: The analysis of the microscopic and SEM images of irradiated E. coli samples with six different visible range radiations is representative of The fact that E. coli responded differently to every applied radiation in the visible region and the most profound inhibitory effects were that of 538nm Visible Range Radiation (Green) which proved to be bactericidal and 590nm Visible Range Radiation (yellow) which was bacteriostatic. The enhanced growth of E. coli with varying degrees was clearly observed in 610nm (orange), 644nm (red), 464nm (Purple) and 453nm (blue). Conclusion: It can be concluded that 538nm (Green) and 590nm (Yellow) can effectively be used for treating E. coli borne diseases.","Azeemi S.T.Y., Shaukat S.F., Azeemi K.S., Khan I., Mahmood K., Naz F.",10.21010/ajtcam.v14i1.4,"African Journal Of Traditional, Complementary And Alternative Medicines"
Establishment Of Two Dimensional (2D) And Three-Dimensional (3D) Melanoma Primary Cultures As A Tool For In Vitro Drug Resistance Studies,"Characteristics of melanoma cells have been deciphered by studies carried out in two dimensional cell cultures growing as adherent monolayers on the bottom of plastic flasks. Melanoma cells can be cultured with a considerable degree of success, and, depending on the further use of the cells obtained in the culture, methodologies have to be adjusted to obtain reliable results. Although there are many melanoma continuous cell lines, in vitro 2D and 3D melanoma primary cell culture may be a more useful model to investigate interactions between cancer cells and immune system, as well as the effect of cytotoxic treatments and personalized medicine in environments more similar to the physiological conditions. Here, we described a protocol which employs many strategies to obtain primary 2D and 3D melanoma cultures as a model to study cell–cell and cell–microenvironment interactions that must be considered to properly design personalized cancer treatments, as well as for testing novel anticancer drugs and drug delivery vehicles.","Cruz Rodríguez N., Lineros J., Rodríguez C.S., Martínez L.M., Rodríguez J.A.",10.1007/978-1-4939-8979-9_8,Methods In Molecular Biology
Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Nt5E Could Be A Prognostic Biomarker,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a type of tumour with a relatively poor prognosis. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors, have improved the treatment status of advanced tumours. However, the emergence of drug resistance has brought difficulties to clinical treatment, and new immune checkpoint research is imminent. The hypoxia-adenosine pathway, in which CD73 encoded by the NT5E gene is a key enzyme for adenosine production, has been identified as an immune checkpoint of great potential. Therefore, NT5E may play an important role in HNSCC. We performed a detailed bioinformatics analysis of NT5E in HNSCC, and the results showed that the overexpression of NT5E in HNSCC was associated with poor prognosis. Our further investigation of the coexpression pattern of HNSCC could provide a reference for drug resistance and immunotherapy studies.","Zhang Y., Kadasah S., Xie J., Gu D.",10.1155/2022/3051907,Applied Bionics And Biomechanics
Treatment Of Concomitant Congenital Pseudarthrosis Of The Fibula With Propeller Periosteal Flap,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital pseudarthrosis of the fibula is not an uncommon condition to accompany congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Persistence of the fibular pseudarthrosis has been linked to inferior outcomes including tibial union and alignment, refractures, and ankle alignment. In this report, we present the results of a pedicled periosteal propeller flap technique for the treatment of fibular pseudarthrosis. METHODS: Ten children with an average age at surgery of 5.3 years who had congenital pseudarthrosis of both tibia and fibula were studied. The tibia was treated with free vascularized fibular grafting, and the ipsilateral fibula was treated with a technique after resection of the pseudarthrosis. A periosteal flap from the proximal healthy part of the fibula is harvested off the bone, rotated 180° based on a branch from the peroneal vessels to cover the fibular defect and fashioned in the form of a tube filled with bone fragments. RESULTS: The periosteal flap size ranged from 5 to 7 cm. Follow-up averaged 37.2 months. The tibia was united in all cases; in 2 of them, refractures occurred and healed with conservative management. The fibula was united in 8 cases. At final follow-up, 5 cases showed residual tibial deformity, and 5 showed residual ankle deformity. Average leg-length discrepancy was 1.4 cm (0-3 cm). CONCLUSION: The pedicled periosteal propeller flap presents a useful new technique for managing concomitant congenital fibular pseudarthrosis.","El-Gammal T.A., Ali A.E.-S., Kotb M.M., Saleh W.R., Ragheb Y.F., Refai O.A., Morsy M.M., El-Gammal Y.T.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000003552,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Antimicrobial Blue Light Inactivation Of Candida Albicans: In Vitro And In Vivo Studies,"ABSTRACT: Fungal infections are a common cause of morbidity, mortality and cost in critical care populations. The increasing emergence of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new therapeutic approaches for fungal infections. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of an innovative approach, antimicrobial blue light (aBL), for inactivation of Candida albicansin vitro and in infected mouse burns. A bioluminescent strain of C. albicans was used. The susceptibilities to aBL (415 nm) were compared between C. albicans and human keratinocytes. The potential development of aBL resistance by C. albicans was investigated via 10 serial passages of C. albicans on aBL exposure. For the animal study, a mouse model of thermal burn infected with the bioluminescent C. albicans strain was used. aBL was delivered to mouse burns approximately 12 h after fungal inoculation. Bioluminescence imaging was performed to monitor in real time the extent of infection in mice. The results obtained from the studies demonstrated that C. albicans was approximately 42-fold more susceptible to aBL than human keratinocytes. Serial passaging of C. albicans on aBL exposure implied a tendency of reduced aBL susceptibility of C. albicans with increasing numbers of passages; however, no statistically significant difference was observed in the post-aBL survival rate of C. albicans between the first and the last passage (P>0.05). A single exposure of 432 J/cm(2) aBL reduced the fungal burden in infected mouse burns by 1.75-log(10) (P=0.015). Taken together, our findings suggest aBL is a potential therapeutic for C. albicans infections.","Zhang Y., Zhu Y., Chen J., Wang Y., Sherwood M.E., Murray C.K., Vrahas M.S., Hooper D.C., Hamblin M.R., Dai T.",10.1080/21505594.2016.1155015,Virulence
The State Of Hand Rub Dispensers In Healthcare Settings – A Multicenter Assessment In 19 German Healthcare Facilities,"Background: Hand hygiene is one of the most important hygiene measures to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Well-functioning hand rub dispensers are the foundation of hand hygiene but are often overlooked in research. As the point of origin for hand hygiene, dispensers not only promote compliance through ease of use, but also strongly influence the amount of hand rub used per disinfection. This work investigates how dispenser types and conditions affect dispensed volumes and usability. Methods: Data from 5,014 wall-mounted or point-of-care dispensers was collected from 19 German healthcare facilities during installation of an electronic hand hygiene monitoring system, including dispenser type and dispensed hand rub volumes. Of these dispensers, 56.2% were metal dispensers, and the majority (89.5%) were wall-mounted. For one hospital, 946 wall-mounted dispensers were analyzed in detail regarding pump material, damages, functionality, cleanliness, and filling levels. Results: Dispensed volumes varied across and within dispenser types, ranging from 0.4 mL to 4.4 mL per full actuation, with the largest volumes generally dispensed by plastic dispensers with a preset of 1.0 to 3.0 mL per actuation. In general, most dispensers dispense more hand rub per full actuation than specified by the manufacturer. When different types of dispensers are used within a healthcare facility, vastly different volumes can be dispensed, making reliable and reproducible disinfection difficult for healthcare workers. In the detailed analysis of 946 dispensers, 27.1% had cosmetic defects, reduced performance, or were unusable, with empty disinfectant being the most common reason. Only 19.7% of working dispensers delivered their maximum volume on the first full actuation. Conclusion: Even though several studies addressed the variability in dispensed volumes of hand hygiene dispensers, studies dealing with dispenser types and functionality are lacking, promoting the common but false assumption that different dispensers may be equivalent and interchangeable. Variability in dispensed volumes, coupled with frequent dispenser defects and maintenance issues, can be a major barrier to hand hygiene compliance. To support healthcare workers, more attention should be paid to ‘dispenser compliance’, selecting dispensers with similar volume ranges and proper maintenance.","Herzer C., Berg T., Hegemann C., Gebhardt T., Niesalla H., Senges C.",10.1186/s13756-024-01470-w,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Outbreak Of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae In A Regional Burn Center,"Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide; however, the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in our region is low. Burn patients are vulnerable to infection because of the loss of the protective skin barrier, thus burn centers prioritize infection prevention and control (IP&C). This report describes a CPE outbreak in a regional burn center. In a period of 2.5 months, four nosocomial cases of CPE were identified, three containing the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene and one Verona integrin-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) gene. The first two cases were identified while there was no CPE patient source on the unit. CPE KPC gene was then isolated in sink drains of three rooms. In addition to rigorous IP&C practices already in place, we implemented additional outbreak measures including restricting admissions to patients with complex burns or burns ≥10% TBSA, admitting patients to other in-patient units, and not permitting elective admissions. We began cohorting patients using nursing team separation for CPE-positive and -negative patients and geographical separation on the unit. Despite aggressive IP&C measures already in place, hospital-acquired CPE colonization/infection occurred. Given that CPE contaminated sinks of the same enzyme were identified, we believe hospital sink drains may the source. This highlights the importance of sink design and engineering solutions to prevent the formation of biofilm and reduce splashing. CPE infections are associated with poor outcomes in patients and significant health system costs due to a longer length of stay and additional institutional resources.","Rehou S., Rotman S., Avaness M., Salt N., Jeschke M.G., Shahrokhi S.",10.1093/jbcr/irac067,Journal Of Burn Care And Research
"Risk Factors For Clostridium Difficile Infection In Surgical Patients Hospitalized In A Tertiary Hospital In Belgrade, Serbia: A Case-Control Study","Background: The objective of this study was to investigate independent risk factors (RFs) connected with healthcare-associated (HA) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in surgical patients, its frequency per surgical wards and in-hospital-mortality at a single hospital. Methods: Risk factors for the infection were prospectively assessed among surgical patients with laboratory confirmed HA CDI and compared with a control group without HA CDI. Results: The overall incidence rate of HA CDI was 2.6 per 10000 patient-days. Significant independent RFs for HA CDI were the use of carbapenems (P = 0.007, OR: 10.62, 95% CI: 1.93-58.4), the admission to intensive care unit (P = 0.004, OR:3.00, 95% CI:1.41-6.40), and the administration of 3rd generation cephalosporins (P = 0.014, OR:2.27, 95% CI:1.18-4.39). Patients with HA CDI had significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared to controls (P: 0.007; OR: 8.95; 95% CI: 1.84-43.43). Conclusions: CDI is an important HA infection in population of surgical patients and this study emphasizes the importance of the wise use of antibiotics, and other infection control strategies in order to prevent HA CDI, and to decrease the incidence and in-hospital mortality rate.","Šuljagić V., Miljković I., Starčević S., Stepić N., Kostić Z., Jovanović D., Brusić-Renaud J., Mijović B., Šipetić-Grujičić S.",10.1186/s13756-017-0188-x,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Establishing Infection Prevention And Control Capacity In An Ebola Treatment Unit Within The First Seven Days Of The 2022 Sudan Virus Disease Outbreak In Uganda,"Introduction: During an outbreak, robust strategies to build Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) capacity are vital for strengthening healthcare worker (HCW) safety. We highlight strategies to establish IPC capacity at an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) within the first week of Uganda's 2022 Sudan Virus Disease Outbreak. Objectives: Building local IPC capacity for improved health outcomes in early outbreak days. Methods: Leveraging hospital staff to enhance IPC capacity, we met with the hospital leadership to streamline coordination. Using the WHO IPC Assessment for Isolation Unit tool, we quantified the HCW and ETU needs. Results were disseminated to the hospital and the National Case Management Pillar, providing daily updates for coordination and financial support. Results: In the assessment, the critical need was IPC training of the ETU staff. A team with advanced IPC experience were deployed as Safety Shift Leads to handle the critical ETU areas, including staff screening, chlorine mixing, donning and doffing, and staff advanced IPC training using Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 179 staff were trained on hand hygiene, donning and doffing, chlorine mixing, waste and spill management, safe patient transfer, ambulance decontamination, and dead body management. We conducted mandatory daily start and end of shift staff screening. Hand hygiene stations were placed in all critical areas. HCW workflow was streamlined by demarcating the ETU Green and Red zones with plastic scaffolding fences and clear labelling. Information Education and Communication materials were pinned. In the Red zone, unidirectional staff flow was encouraged, moving from dry to wet patients and proper waste management and hand hygiene stations placed at patient beds. A Safety Shift Lead supervised donning and doffing of all Staff from the Red zone using SOPs. The same strategies were scaled to the general hospital non-ETU staff, leveraging daily staff meetings. Conclusion: Early implementation of robust IPC strategies using a Safety Shift Lead approach at the ETU during the initial response days is crucial for improved health outcomes in an outbreak.","Wailagala A., Ainembabazi P., Okwaro P., Kobba K., Katusabe F., Nabawanuka D., Kesande M., Nanyondo J., Bulwadda D., Lamorde M.",10.1186/s13756-023-01276-2,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Sorafenib Sensitizes Melanoma Cells To Vemurafenib Through Ferroptosis,"Background: BRAF gene mutation causes melanoma patients to develop drug resistance after 8-9 months BRAF inhibitors treatment. Therefore, overcoming BRAF inhibitor resistance has important implications for improving patient survival. Sorafenib directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation by blocking the RAF/MEK/ERK-mediated cell signaling pathway. It remains unknown that whether the combination of sorafenib with vemurafenib could sensitize melanoma cells to vemurafenib, and the underlying mechanism needs to be clarified. Methods: Vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells A375/Vem and SK-Mel-28/Vem were established by exposing to a series of concentration of vemurafenib. Cell viability was measured when A375 and SK-Mel-28 cells treated with vemurafenib or combined with sorafenib. Meanwhile the levels of Iron, GSH, MDA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected. Finally we examined that whether sorafenib sensitizes melanoma cells to vemurafenib through ferroptosis. Results: We found that sorafenib sensitized melanoma cells to vemurafenib. Sorafenib treatment did not significantly alter the production of ROS and the content of iron, GSH and MDA in vemurafenib resistant cells, but cotreatment of sorafenib and vemurafenib dramatically upregulated ROS production, MDA and iron, but decreased GSH concentration. Interestingly, sorafenib strongly promoted vemurafenib-induced cell death, which was blocked by lipid peroxidation inhibitors ferrostatin-1 but not ZVAD-FMK or necrosulfonamid. Conclusions: Sorafenib sensitized melanoma cells to vemurafenib by increasing ROS production through ferroptosis. Our study reveals that the combination of sorafenib may provide a novel strategy of vemurafenib resistant melanoma therapy.","Tang F., Li S., Liu D., Chen J., Han C.",10.21037/tcr.2020.01.62,Translational Cancer Research
Mechanism Of Ecm-Induced Dormancy And Chemoresistance In A549 Human Lung Carcinoma Cells,"It is now widely accepted that the tumor microenvironment influences the fate of cancer cells and plays crucial roles in regulating tumor dormancy and chemoresistance. The standard cell culture system on plastic surfaces does not account for cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and is thus a less reliable approach to analyze cellular activity ex vivo. In the present study, A549 lung cancer cells were cultured in a semi-solid growth substrate (Matrigel) to mimic the tumor microenvironment and to investigate the role played by ECM proteins, as well as to evaluate the mechanism of cell-ECM communication. A549 cells embedded in semisolid Matrigel exhibited dormant cell characteristics, including decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion rates, compared with the corresponding cells cultured on plastic plates. Exposure of A549 cells to Matrigel leads to resistance against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide, paclitaxel, vinblastine, doxorubicin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose). Cell cycle distribution analysis indicated that a larger percentage of the cells embedded within semi-solid Matrigel was arrested in the G0/G1 phase. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that A549 cells cultured in semi-solid Matrigel exhibited a marked decrease in the expression levels of genes that are related to tumor progression and invasion (uPA, uPAR, MMP2, MMP7, MMP9 and CXCR4). The effects of altering various signaling pathways, such as p-ERK, p-Akt and p-STAT3, were evaluated, in order to assess whether these pathways could account for the observed responses of the cells. The inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt activation using specific inhibitors induced G0/G1 arrest and drug resistance. These results demonstrated that Matrigel drove A549 cells into a drug-resistant dormancy state, most likely through inhibition of the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Cell culture within semi-solid Matrigel offered a simple in vitro model for studying the mechanisms responsible for tumor dormancy and drug resistance. These studies may lead to therapeutic approaches that can eliminate dormant tumor cells and prevent disease recurrence.","Keeratichamroen S., Lirdprapamongkol K., Svasti J.",10.3892/or.2018.6258,Oncology Reports
Do Post-Injury Prophylactic Antibiotics Reduce Infection For Isolated Midface Fractures: A Cohort Study,"Purpose: Fractures of the midface are a core component to the practice of contemporary oral and maxillofacial trainees and surgeons. As such, in an era where antibiotic resistance is increasing it is important to investigate if antibiotics are required after midface fractures to prevent infections before follow-up in an outpatient setting. The purpose of this study is to determine whether postinjury prophylactic preoperative antibiotics reduce rates of infection after midface fracture. Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. Patients who presented to Royal Brisbane Hospital and Townsville Hospital with isolated midface fractures between January 2017 and January 2019 were included. Clinical and demographic data of patients who received postinjury prophylactic antibiotics were compared to those who did not using the χ(2) test. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with increased odds of postinjury prophylactic antibiotic prescription. Results: In total, 1,353 patients with midfacial fractures over the 2-year period were included. In addition, 724 (53.5%) patients received postinjury antibiotics and 629 (46.5%) patients did not. The overall rate of infection was very low: 1 patient who received postinjury prophylactic antibiotics (0.1%) developed infection compared to 2 patients (0.3%) who did not receive postinjury prophylactic antibiotics, and this difference was not significant (χ(2) = 0.49; P = .48). Male sex (odds ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.7; P = .02) and tobacco use (odds ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.7; P = .008) were associated with an increased odds of postinjury prophylactic antibiotic prescription in the univariate analyses, but were no longer significant once site, age, and fracture type were adjusted for in the multivariate model. Conclusions: The rate of infection after midface fracture was low and there was no significant difference in infection rates for patients who received postinjury prophylactic antibiotics compared to those who did not. Use of postinjury prophylactic preoperative antibiotics for midfacial fractures should be reconsidered.","Tuckett J., Brierly G.I., Tong J., Mcgowan K., Ramalingam L., Batstone M.D.",10.1016/j.joms.2022.07.136,Journal Of Oral And Maxillofacial Surgery
Antibiotic Prescription In Bone Augmentation And Dental Implant Procedures: A Multi-Center Study,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to antibiotic recommendations and safety aspects of restrictive use are important components when combating antibiotic resistance. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of national guidelines on antibiotic prescriptions for bone augmentation procedures among dentists working at three specialized clinics. The secondary aim was to assess the occurrence of postoperative infections. METHODS: Medical charts of 400 patients treated with bone augmentation were reviewed: 200 in the years 2010-2011 and 200 in 2014-2015. The Swedish national recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis were published in 2012. RESULTS: There was a wide variation in antibiotic regiments prescribed throughout the study. The number of patients treated with antibiotic prophylaxis in a single dose of 2 g amoxicillin, and treated as advocated in the national recommendations, was low and decreasing between the two time periods from 25% (n = 50/200) in 2010-2011 to 18.5% (n = 37/200) in 2014-2015. The number of patients not given any antibiotics either as a prophylactic single dose or during the postoperative phase increased (P < 0.001). The administration of a 3-7-days antibiotic prescription increased significantly from 25.5% in 2010-2011 to 35% in 2014-2015. The postoperative infection rates (4.5% and 6.5%) were without difference between the studied periods. Smoking and omitted antibiotic prophylaxis significantly increased the risk of postoperative infection. Logistic regression analyses showed that patient male gender and suffering from a disease were predictive factors for the clinician to adhere to the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of national recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis before bone augmentation procedures, the patient group receiving a single preoperative dose decreased while the group not given antibiotic prophylaxis increased. There was no difference in occurrence of postoperative infections between the two time periods. The results indicate a need for educational efforts and strategies for implementation of antibiotic prudence and awareness among surgeons performing bone augmentation procedures.","Bazsefidpay N., Holmqvist F., Khalil D., Wexell C.L., Hultin M., Nilsson P., Lund B.",10.1186/s12903-023-03534-6,Bmc Oral Health
Interrogation Of Essentiality In The Reconstructed Haemophilus Influenzae Metabolic Network Identifies Lipid Metabolism Antimicrobial Targets: Preclinical Evaluation Of A Fabh Β-Ketoacyl-Acp Synthase Inhibitor,"Expediting drug discovery to fight antibacterial resistance requires holistic approaches at system levels. In this study, we focused on the human-adapted pathogen Haemophilus influenzae, and by constructing a high-quality genome-scale metabolic model, we rationally identified new metabolic drug targets in this organism. Contextualization of available gene essentiality data within in silico predictions identified most genes involved in lipid metabolism as promising targets. We focused on the b-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III FabH, responsible for catalyzing the first step in the FASII fatty acid synthesis pathway and feedback inhibition. Docking studies provided a plausible three-dimensional model of FabH in complex with the synthetic inhibitor 1-(5-(2-fluoro-5-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl) pyridin-2-yl)piperidine-4-acetic acid (FabHi). Validating our in silico predictions, FabHi reduced H. influenzae viability in a dose- and strain-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect was independent of fabH gene expression levels. fabH allelic variation was observed among H. influenzae clinical isolates. Many of these polymorphisms, relevant for stabilization of the dimeric active form of FabH and/or activity, may modulate the inhibitory effect as part of a complex multifactorial process with the overall metabolic context emerging as a key factor tuning FabHi activity. Synergies with antibiotics were not observed and bacteria were not prone to develop resistance. Inhibitor administration during H. influenzae infection on a zebrafish septicemia infection model cleared bacteria without signs of host toxicity. Overall, we highlight the potential of H. influenzae metabolism as a source of drug targets, metabolic models as target-screening tools, and FASII targeting suitability to counteract this bacterial infection.","López-López N., León D.S., De Castro S., Díez-Martínez R., Iglesias-Bexiga M., Camarasa M.J., Menéndez M., Nogales J., Garmendia J.",10.1128/msystems.01459-21,Msystems
Efficacy Of Dalbavancin In The Treatment Of Mrsa Rat Sternal Osteomyelitis With Mediastinitis,"Objectives: Dalbavancin, a semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide, is characterized by a long plasma half-life, which allows weekly dosing. Dalbavancin may be a good treatment option for patients with deep sternal wound infections owing to its improved pharmacokinetic profile and antibacterial activity compared with currently used antibiotics. Here we evaluated the efficacy of 7 or 14 days of treatment with dalbavancin, compared with vancomycin and with saline, in reducing sternal bone MRSA counts in a rat Staphylococcus aureus deep sternal wound infection model. Methods: A mid-sternal wound was surgically induced in anaesthetized rats. A clinical strain of MRSA was injected into the sternum to establish infection. Rats were treated intraperitoneally for 7 or 14 days with dalbavancin, vancomycin or saline. The number of cfu per gram of sternum or spleen tissue was determined using viable counts. The antibacterial efficacy was determined by the reduction in bacterial counts per gram of sternum or spleen tissue in each treatment group. Results: Treatment with dalbavancin was superior to treatment with saline for 7 days (0.75 log reduction in bone cfu) or 14 days (>3 log reduction in bone cfu) and similar to treatment with vancomycin. Additionally, dalbavancin was also effective in reducing systemic dissemination of MRSA. Conclusions: Dalbavancin is effective in the treatment of MRSA rat sternal osteomyelitis.","Barnea Y., Lerner A., Aizic A., Navon-Venezia S., Rachi E., Dunne M.W., Puttagunta S., Carmeli Y.",10.1093/jac/dkv357,Journal Of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy
Mechanistic Insights Into Co-Administration Of Allosteric And Orthosteric Drugs To Overcome Drug-Resistance In T315I Bcr-Abl1,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm, driven by the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncoprotein. The discovery of orthosteric BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting its active ATP-binding pocket, such as first-generation Imatinib and second-generation Nilotinib (NIL), has profoundly revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of CML. However, currently targeted therapeutics still face considerable challenges with the inevitable emergence of drug-resistant mutations within BCR-ABL1. One of the most common resistant mutations in BCR-ABL1 is the T315I gatekeeper mutation, which confers resistance to most current TKIs in use. To resolve such conundrum, co-administration of orthosteric TKIs and allosteric drugs offers a novel paradigm to tackle drug resistance. Remarkably, previous studies have confirmed that the dual targeting BCR-ABL1 utilizing orthosteric TKI NIL and allosteric inhibitor ABL001 resulted in eradication of the CML xenograft tumors, exhibiting promising therapeutic potential. Previous studies have demonstrated the cooperated mechanism of two drugs. However, the conformational landscapes of synergistic effects remain unclear, hampering future efforts in optimizations and improvements. Hence, extensive large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wide type (WT), WT-NIL, T315I, T315I-NIL, T315I-ABL001 and T315I-ABL001-NIL systems were carried out in an attempt to address such question. Simulation data revealed that the dynamic landscape of NIL-bound BCR-ABL1 was significantly reshaped upon ABL001 binding, as it shifted from an active conformation towards an inactive conformation. The community network of allosteric signaling was analyzed to elucidate the atomistic overview of allosteric regulation within BCR-ABL1. Moreover, binding free energy analysis unveiled that the affinity of NIL to BCR-ABL1 increased by the induction of ABL001, which led to its favorable binding and the release of drug resistance. The findings uncovered the in-depth structural mechanisms underpinning dual-targeting towards T315I BCR-ABL1 to overcome its drug resistance and will offer guidance for the rational design of next generations of BCR-ABL1 modulators and future combinatory therapeutic regimens.","Zhang H., Zhu M., Li M., Ni D., Wang Y., Deng L., Du K., Lu S., Shi H., Cai C.",10.3389/fphar.2022.862504,Frontiers In Pharmacology
Use Of Medical-Grade Honey To Treat Clinically Infected Heel Pressure Ulcers In High-Risk Patients: A Prospective Case Series,"Management of locally infected heel-pressure ulcers (HPUs) remains challenging, and given the increasing occurrence of infections resistant to antibiotic therapy and patients’ unwillingness to surgery, innovative and effective approaches must be considered. Medical-grade honey (MGH) could be an alternative therapeutic approach due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and healing properties. This study aimed to present the high effectiveness and safety of MGH for the conservative treatment of clinically infected HPUs. In this case series, we have prospectively studied nine patients with local signs of infected HPUs. In all cases, HPUs persisted for more than 4 weeks, and previous treatments with topical antibiotics or antiseptic products were ineffective. All patients were at high-risk to develop HPU infection due to their advanced age (median age of 86 years), several comorbidities, and permanent immobility. All wounds were treated with MGH products (L-Mesitran), leading to infection resolution within 3–4 weeks and complete wound healing without complication. Considering the failure of previous treatments and the chronic nature of the wounds, MGH was an effective treatment. MGH-based products are clinically and cost-effective for treating hard-to-heal pressure ulcers such as HPUs. Thus, MGH can be recommended as an alternative or complementary therapy in wound healing.","Papanikolaou G.E., Gousios G., Cremers N.A.J.",10.3390/antibiotics12030605,Antibiotics
High-Level Recombinant Protein Production By The Basidiomycetous Yeast Pseudozyma Antarctica Under A Xylose-Inducible Xylanase Promoter,"Yeast host–vector systems are useful tools for the production of recombinant proteins. Here, we report the construction of a new high-level expression plasmid pPAX1-neo for the basidiomycetous yeast, Pseudozyma antarctica. pPAX1-neo harbours a xylose-inducible expression cassette under control of the xylanase promoter and terminator of P. antarctica T-34, a selection cassette of neomycin/G418 with an Escherichia coli neomycin resistance gene under control of the homocitrate synthase promoter of strain T-34, and an autonomously replicating sequence fragment of Ustilago maydis (UARS). Biodegradable plastic (BP)-degrading enzymes of P. antarctica JCM10317 (PaE) and Paraphoma-related fungal strain B47-9 (PCLE) were used as reporter proteins and inserted into pPAX1-neo, resulting in pPAX1-neo::PaCLE1 and pPAX1-neo::PCLE, respectively. Homologous and heterologous BP-degrading enzyme production of transformants of P. antarctica T-34 were detected on agar plates containing xylose and emulsified BP. Recombinant PaE were also produced by transformants of other Pseudozyma strains including Pseudozyma aphidis, Pseudozyma rugulosa, and Pseudozyma tsukubaensis. To improve the stability of transformed genes in cells, the UARS fragment was removed from linearized pPAX1-neo::PaCLE1 and integrated into the chromosome of the P. antarctica strain, GB-4(0), which was selected as a PaE producer in xylose media. Two transformants, GB-4(0)-X14 and X49, had an 11-fold higher activity compared with the wild type strain in xylose-containing liquid media. By xylose fed-batch cultivation using a 3-L jar fermentor, GB-4(0)-X14 produced 73.5 U mL(−1) of PaE, which is 13.4-fold higher than that of the wild type strain GB-4(0), which produced 5.5 U mL(−1) of PaE.","Watanabe T., Morita T., Koike H., Yarimizu T., Shinozaki Y., Sameshima-Yamashita Y., Yoshida S., Koitabashi M., Kitamoto H.",10.1007/s00253-015-7232-7,Applied Microbiology And Biotechnology
The Plasticity Of Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells: Implications In Therapeutic Resistance,"The ever-growing perception of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as a plastic state rather than a hardwired defined entity has evolved our understanding of the functional and biological plasticity of these elusive components in malignancies. Pancreatic cancer (PC), based on its biological features and clinical evolution, is a prototypical example of a CSC-driven disease. Since the discovery of pancreatic CSCs (PCSCs) in 2007, evidence has unraveled their control over many facets of the natural history of PC, including primary tumor growth, metastatic progression, disease recurrence, and acquired drug resistance. Consequently, the current near-ubiquitous treatment regimens for PC using aggressive cytotoxic agents, aimed at ‘‘tumor debulking’’ rather than eradication of CSCs, have proven ineffective in providing clinically convincing improvements in patients with this dreadful disease. Herein, we review the key hallmarks as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms of CSCs that mediate treatment failure in PC and enlist the potential CSC-targeting ‘natural agents’ that are gaining popularity in recent years. A better understanding of the molecular and functional landscape of PCSC-intrinsic evasion of chemotherapeutic drugs offers a facile opportunity for treating PC, an intractable cancer with a grim prognosis and in dire need of effective therapeutic advances.","Patil K., Khan F.B., Akhtar S., Ahmad A., Uddin S.",10.1007/s10555-021-09979-x,Cancer And Metastasis Reviews
Overcoming Chemoresistance To B-Raf Inhibitor In Melanoma Via Targeted Inhibition Of Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase1 Using 3-Mercaptopropionic Acid,"The resistance of melanoma to BRAF inhibitors remains a tough clinical challenge. In order to explore the underlying mechanism of drug resistance in melanoma, we established the resistant cell line to vemurafenib, and assessed the changes of drug-resistant cells on proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress and tumor stemness. Our results suggest that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PCK1) is activated and inhibits the oxidative stress caused by vemurafenib in drug-resistant cells. Long term treatment of vemurafenib increases the expression of PCK1 which reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating PI3K/Akt pathway. After the inhibition of PCK1 by 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA), the therapeutic sensitivity of vemurafenib is restored. In conclusion, this study disclosed that drug-resistant cells appeared to regulate their own proliferation, oxidative stress and tumor dryness by activating Akt/PCK1/ROS pathway, and shed new insights into acquiring drug resistance in melanoma.","Ren M., Wang L., Gao Z.-X., Deng X.-Y., Shen K.-J., Li Y.-L., Ding Y.-T., Wei C.-Y., Gu J.-Y.",10.1080/21655979.2022.2080385,Bioengineered
Brafi Induced Demethylation Of Mir-152-5P Regulates Phenotype Switching By Targeting Txnip In Cutaneous Melanoma,"Treatment of advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma using BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) eventually leads to drug resistance and selects for highly metastatic tumor cells. We compared the most differentially dysregulated miRNA expression profiles of vemurafenib-resistant and highly-metastatic melanoma cell lines obtained from GEO DataSets. We discovered miR-152-5p was a potential regulator mediating melanoma drug resistance and metastasis. Functionally, knockdown of miR-152-5p significantly compromised the metastatic ability of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells and overexpression of miR-152-5p promoted the formation of slow-cycling phenotype. Furthermore, we explored the cause of how and why miR-152-5p affected metastasis in depth. Mechanistically, miR-152-5p targeted TXNIP which affected metastasis and BRAFi altered the methylation status of MIR152 promoter. Our study highlights the crucial role of miR-152-5p on melanoma metastasis after BRAFi treatment and holds significant implying that discontinuous dosing strategy may improve the benefit of advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma patients.","Li K., Tang M., Tong S., Wang C., Sun Q., Lv M., Sun X., Wang T., Jin S.",10.1007/s10495-019-01586-0,Apoptosis
Endocrine Disruption: In Silico Interactions Between Phthalate Plasticizers And Corticosteroid Binding Globulin,"Endocrine disruption is a phenomenon when a man-made or natural compound interferes with normal hormone function in human or animal body systems. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have assumed considerable importance as a result of industrial activity, mass production of synthetic chemicals and environmental pollution. Phthalate plasticizers are a group of chemicals used widely and diversely in industry especially in the plastic industry, and many of the phthalate compounds have endocrine-disrupting properties. Increasing evidence indicates that steroid nuclear receptors and steroid binding proteins are the main targets of endocrine disruption. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a steroid binding protein that binds and transports cortisol in the blood circulation and is a potential target for endocrine disruption. An imbalance of cortisol in the body leads to many health problems. Induced fit docking of nine important and environmentally relevant phthalate plasticizers (DMP, BBP, DBP, DIBP, DnHP, DEHP, DINP, DnOP, DIDP) showed interactions with 10–19 amino acid residues of CBG. Comparison of the interacting residues of CBG with phthalate ligands and cortisol showed an overlapping of the majority (53–82%) of residues for each phthalate. Five of nine phthalate compounds and cortisol shared a hydrogen bonding interaction with the Arg-252 residue of CBG. Long-chain phthalates, such as DEHP, DINP, DnOP and DIDP displayed a higher binding affinity and formed a number of interactions with CBG in comparison to short-chain phthalates. The similarity in structural binding characteristics of phthalate compounds and native ligand cortisol suggested potential competitive conflicts in CBG-cortisol binding function and possible disruption of cortisol and progesterone homeostasis.","Sheikh I.A., Beg M.A.",10.1002/jat.3497,Journal Of Applied Toxicology
Targeting Signal-Transducer-And-Activator-Of-Transcription 3 Sensitizes Human Cutaneous Melanoma Cells To Braf Inhibitor,"Melanoma treatment with the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib provides therapeutic benefits but the common emergence of drug resistance remains a challenge. To define molecular mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance, we generated A375-R, WM35-R cell lines resistant to vemurafenib and show that the phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 was upregulated in these cells in vitro and in vivo. In particular, activation of the Signal-transducer-and-activator-of-transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway was associated with vemurafenib resistance. Inhibition of this pathway with STAT3-specific siRNA (shRNA) sensitized A375-R, WM35-R cells to vemurafenib and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, targeting STAT3 induced expression of miR-579-3p and elicited resistance to vemurafenib. However, targeting microRNA (miR)-579-3p with anti-miR-579-3p reversed the resistance to vemurafenib. Together, these results indicated that STAT3-mediated downexpression of miR-579-3p caused resistance to vemurafenib. Our findings suggest novel approaches to overcome resistance to vemurafenib by combining vemurafenib with STAT3 sliencing or miR-579-3p overexpression.","Wang X., Qu H., Dong Y., Wang G., Zhen Y., Zhang L.",10.3233/CBM-181365,Cancer Biomarkers
Cell-Free Extracts From Human Fat Tissue With A Hyaluronan-Based Hydrogel Attenuate Inflammation In A Spinal Cord Injury Model Through M2 Microglia/Microphage Polarization,"Treatment for spinal cord injuries (SCIs) is often ineffective because SCIs result in a loss of nerve tissue, glial scar formation, local ischemia and secondary inflammation. The current promising strategy for SCI is the combination of bioactive materials and cytokines. Bioactive materials support the injured spinal cord, stabilize the morphology, and avoid excessive inflammatory responses. Fat extract (FE) is a cell-free liquid component containing a variety of cytokines extracted from human fat tissue using mechanical methods. In this research, a biocompatible HAMC (hyaluronan and methylcellulose) loaded with FE is used to treat a model of spinal cord contusion in mice. The composite not only inhibits death of neuro- and vascular cells and leads to the preservation of neural and vascular structure, but also modulates the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages in the locally injured region. Specifically, FE promotes the polarization of macrophages from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. During the screening of the involved pathways, it is corroborated that activation of the STAT6/Arg-1 signaling pathway is involved in macrophage M2 polarization. In summary, FE is a promising treatment for SCI, as it is easy to obtain, nonimmunogenic, and effective.","Xu G.-Y., Xu S., Zhang Y.-X., Yu Z.-Y., Zou F., Ma X.-S., Xia X.-L., Zhang W.-J., Jiang J.-Y., Song J.",10.1002/smll.202107838,"Small (Weinheim An Der Bergstrasse, Germany)"
An Injectable Adhesive Antibacterial Hydrogel Wound Dressing For Infected Skin Wounds,"It's an exigent need for the improvement of novel antibacterial wound dressings with the increasing threats of drug resistance caused by excessive use of the antibiotics. In this work, an injectable, adhesive, hemostatic, biocompatible and bactericidal hydrogel wound dressing was fabricated. An injectable hydrogel can fill the irregular wound due to the characteristic of reversible sol-gel transition, whereas conventional dressings don't possess this ability. Oxidized alginate (ADA) and catechol-modified gelatin (Gel-Cat) were selected as the polymer backbones and they can crosslink in situ through double dynamic bonds, which were Schiff base and catechol-Fe coordinate bond; polydopamine decorated silver nanoparticles (PDA@Ag NPs) were also introduced into the hydrogel network. The double dynamic bonds endowed the hydrogel with injectable ability, shorter gelation time and enhanced mechanical property. And the aldehyde and catechol groups on the chains of ADA and Gel-Cat gave the hydrogel excellent adhesiveness. In addition, the PDA@Ag NPs in this system play two roles: one is bactericidal agent which can release from the hydrogel to kill the bacteria; the other is photothermal agent to convert 808 nm near-infrared light into heat to realize sterilization. In vitro study, the hydrogel displayed bactericidal ability against S. aureus and E. coli whether in photothermal antimicrobial test or agar diffusion test. In vivo test also testified that the hydrogel had a prominent therapeutic effect on infected wound through reducing inflammatory response and accelerating angiogenesis. Thus, we anticipate that our double dynamic bonds crosslinked hydrogel with PDA@Ag NPs as the antimicrobial agent can be a novel therapeutic way for infected wounds.","Ma W., Dong W., Zhao S., Du T., Wang Y., Yao J., Liu Z., Sun D., Zhang M.",10.1016/j.msec.2021.112584,"Materials Science & Engineering.

Concurrent Inhibition Of Fak/Src And Mek Overcomes Mek Inhibitor Resistance In Neurofibromatosis Type I Related Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas which lack effective drugs. Loss of the RAS GTPase-activating protein NF1 and subsequent overactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK) signaling exist nearly uniformly in MPNST, making MAPK inhibition a promising therapeutic intervention. However, the efficacy of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) monotherapy was limited in MPNST and the relative mechanisms remained largely unexplored. In this study, we generated three MEKi-resistant cell models and investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance using high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing. We discovered that cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by MEKi were rescued in MEKi-resistant cells and the upregulation of LAMA4/ITGB1/FAK/SRC signaling conferred resistance to MEKi. In addition, concurrent inhibition of MAPK signaling and FAK/SRC cascade could sensitize MPNST cells to MEKi. Our findings provide potential solutions to overcome MEKi resistance and effective combination therapeutic strategies for treating MPNSTs.","Gu Y., Wei C., Chung M., Li H., Guo Z., Long M., Li Y., Wang W., Aimaier R., Li Q., Wang Z.",10.3389/fonc.2022.910505,Frontiers In Oncology
Identifying Drug Resistant Cancer Cells Using Microbubble Well Arrays,"Drug resistance is a characteristic of tumor initiating cells that can give rise to metastatic disease. In this work we demonstrate the use of microbubble well arrays as a cell culture platform to enumerate and characterize drug resistant cells in a human derived tumorigenic squamous cell carcinoma cell line. The spherical architecture and compliant hydrophobic composition of the microbubble well favors single cell survival, clonal proliferation and formation of spheres that do not grow on standard tissue culture plastic and are resistant to cisplatin. Spheres form in isolation and in microbubble wells containing proliferating cells and to some degree they stain positive for common stem cell markers CD44 and CD133. Spheres are also observed in cellularized primary human tumors cultured in microbubble arrays. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential for microbubble array technology to enumerate cancer cells resistant to standard care drugs with the ability to test alternative drug combinations. This capability can be developed for designing patient specific treatment strategies. Recovery of drug-resistant cells will allow a more full characterization of their gene expression profile thereby expanding our fundamental knowledge and ability to develop new targets to fight metastatic disease.","Pu Q., Spooner R., Delouise L.A.",10.1007/s10544-017-0160-9,Biomedical Microdevices
Long-Term Evaluation Of Teres Major To Infraspinatus Transfer For Treatment Of Shoulder Sequelae In Obstetrical Brachial Plexus Palsy,"BACKGROUND: The long-term results of soft tissue rebalancing procedures of the shoulder in obstetric brachial plexus palsy have been scarcely reported. The effect of this procedure on the evolution of secondary bone changes has been a subject of controversy. METHODS: Twenty-six children are included in this study. All initially had postganglionic C5-6 or C5-7 (Narakas types I and II) obstetric brachial plexus palsy, which spontaneously recovered. Children included are those who had persistent external rotation weakness with or without internal rotation contracture, nondysplastic glenohumeral joint, and functioning teres major. All had anterior shoulder release and teres major to infraspinatus transfer to correct internal rotation deformity and/or increase active shoulder external rotation. Patients were 18 males and 8 females. The right upper limb was affected in 16 patients, and the left in 10. Surgery was performed at an average age of 3.01 years (range, 1-10 years). Follow-up averaged 8.2 years (range, 5-16 years). Eight cases (30%) were followed up for 10 years or greater. Age at final follow-up averaged 10.5 years (range, 6-17.8 years). RESULTS: The results showed to be significant: 67 degrees (63%), 71.3 degrees (412%), and -32 degrees (-35%), respectively. There was no single recurrence of internal rotation deformity. Global Mallet score averaged 20 ± 2.7. Global abduction and external rotation averaged 3.5 ± 0.8 and 4 ± 0.3, respectively. Shoulder abduction range included an average of 45 degrees glenohumeral and 65 degrees scapulothoracic motion. Postoperative internal rotation in adduction was limited to 55.96 ± 25.65 degrees and was significantly lower that the preoperative value. Radiological measurements showed no significant differences between the operated and normal sides. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the long-term results after soft tissue rebalancing, combined with open reduction when required, demonstrated significant improvement of abduction and external rotation and significant loss of internal rotation. The difference in glenoid version and humeral head subluxation continued to be insignificant compared with the normal side.","El-Gammal T.A., Ali A.E.-S., Kotb M.M., Saleh W.R., El-Gammal Y.T.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000002288,Annals Of Plastic Surgery

Oncogenic Kras: Signaling And Drug Resistance,"RAS proteins play a role in many physiological signals transduction processes, including cell growth, division, and survival. The Ras protein has amino acids 188-189 and functions as GTPase. These proteins are switch molecules that cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). KRAS is one of the Ras superfamily isoforms (N-RAS, H-RAS, and K-RAS) that frequently mutate in cancer. The mutation of KRAS is essentially performing the transformation in humans. Since most RAS proteins belong to GTPase, mutated and GTP-bound active RAS is found in many cancers. Despite KRAS being an important molecule in mostly human cancer, including pancreatic and breast, numerous efforts in years past have persisted in cancer therapy targeting KRAS mutant. This review summarizes the biological characteristics of these proteins and the recent progress in the exploration of KRAS-targeted anticancer, leading to new insight.","Kim H.J., Lee H.N., Jeong M.S., Jang S.B.",10.3390/cancers13225599,Cancers
Pathogenic Roles Of Long Noncoding Rnas In Melanoma: Implications In Diagnosis And Therapies,"Melanoma is one of the most dangerous types of cutaneous neoplasms, which are pigment-producing cells of neuroectodermal origin found all over the body. A great deal of research is focused on the mechanisms of melanoma to promote better diagnostic and treatment options for melanoma in its advanced stages. The progression of melanoma involves alteration in different levels of gene expression. With the successful implementation of next-generation sequencing technology, an increasing number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) sequences have been discovered, and a significant number of them have phenotypic effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies, implying that they play an important role in the occurrence and progression of human cancers, particularly melanoma. A number of evidence indicated that lncRNAs are important regulators in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, immune escape, energy metabolism, drug resistance, epigenetic regulation. To better understand the role of lncRNAs in melanoma tumorigenesis, we categorize melanoma-associated lncRNAs according to their cellular functions and associations with gene expression and signaling pathways in this review. Based on the mechanisms of lncRNA, we discuss the possibility of lncRNA-target treatments, and the application of liquid biopsies to detect lncRNAs in melanoma diagnosis and prognosis.","Xiao Y., Xia Y., Wang Y., Xue C.",10.1016/j.gendis.2021.08.007,Genes And Diseases

After release, exosomes are taken up by neighboring or distant cells, and the miRNAs contained within modulate such processes as interfering with tumor immunity and the microenvironment, possibly facilitating tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and drug resistance. Therefore, exosomal miRNAs have a significant function in regulating cancer progression. Here, we briefly review recent findings regarding tumor-derived exosomes, including RNA sorting and delivering mechanism. We then describe the intercommunication occurring between different cells via exosomal miRNAs in tumor microenvironmnt, with impacts on tumor proliferation, vascularization, metastasis and other biological characteristics. Finally, we highlight the potential role of these molecules as biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis and tumor resistance to therapeutics.","Sun Z., Shi K., Yang S., Liu J., Zhou Q., Wang G., Song J., Li Z., Zhang Z., Yuan W.",10.1186/s12943-018-0897-7,Molecular Cancer
Anthropometric Analysis Of The External Nose Of The Egyptian Males,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe average nasal anthropometric measurements for young Egyptian males by using the Rhinobase® software. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving the evaluation of facial photographs. Frontal, right lateral and basal photographs for 300 healthy adult male Egyptian volunteers (n = 300) were taken; then, the photos were edited using Rhinobase® Software and CorelDraw graphics (2017) software. Twenty anthropometric landmarks were determined. The calculated measurements of the soft tissue of the external nose included ten linear measurements and five angles. RESULTS: The means of the linear measurements of the external nose in this study were as follows: nasal height (56.12 mm), nasal bridge length (47.0 mm), columella length (9.1 mm), alar length (29.3 mm), morphological nose width (41.0 mm), anatomical nose width (38.0 mm), nasal tip protrusion (21.0 mm), nasal tip projection using 'Goode's method' (29.36 mm), dorsum width (9.6 mm) and nasion height (2.04 mm). The means of the angular measurements of the nose were as follows: nasofacial angle (33.1°), nasofrontal angle (144.0°), nasolabial angle (104.5°), nasomental angle (127.6°) and mentocervical angle (104.7°). CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences of the external nasal anthropometric values exist; hence, it is important to establish the average anthropometric measures for several races and ethnic groups. Measurements collected in this study can serve as a database for anthropometric average values of the external nose in healthy adult Egyptian males. Moreover, these measurements can aid in planning prior to nasal reconstruction and esthetic rhinoplasty by serving as a reference standard. Although the Rhinobase® software is an easy, reliable and safe indirect method for nasal analysis, we should be cautious during interpretation of some edited landmarks on Rhinobase® software pictures. In addition, inserting two rulers (in the horizontal and vertical dimension) allows accurate assessment of the linear anthropometric measurements.

Microbiological Profile Of Infections In A Tertiary Care Burns Unit,"Background: The burden of infections among burns patients is higher in healthcare settings due to partial or complete loss of skin as a physical barrier among these patients. We intend to present microbiological profile of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in South India. Aim: To describe microbiological profile of infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of clinical isolates from burns patients in our tertiary care hospital. Materials and methods: This retrospective analysis was done on consecutive patients admitted with burns over a period of three years at Apollo Specialty Hospitals, a tertiary care facility in Vanagaram, Chennai. Data analysis included clinical isolates from blood, urine, tissue, pus and tracheal aspirate. Types of bloodstream infections, urosepsis and antibiogram are described. Results: Among 219 clinical isolates from various samples, 75% were gram-negative, 19% gram-positive and 6% were yeast like fungi. Among bloodstream infections, 32% were polymicrobial. Urosepsis was observed in 39% patients. Wound infections with sepsis was seen in 39% patients. Gram-negative isolates showed better susceptibility to amikacin, carbapenems, beta lactam – beta lactamase inhibitor combinations. Gram-positive isolates had better susceptibility to macrolides, doxycycline, glycopeptides. Conclusion: The high prevalence of gram-negative, polymicrobial infections and multidrug resistant bacteria noted in our patients and the sensitivity patterns would help with appropriate decision on initial antibiotic therapy. However escalation and de-escalation of antibiotics should be planned based on culture reports.","Ebenezer R., Princess I., Vadala R., Kumar S., Ramakrishnan N., Krishnan G.",10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23234,Indian Journal Of Critical Care Medicine
Antibacterial Insights Into Alternariol And Its Derivative Alternariol Monomethyl Ether Produced By A Marine Fungus,"Alternaria alternata FB1 is a marine fungus identified as a candidate for plastic degradation in our previous study. This fungus has been recently shown to produce secondary metabolites with significant antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the notorious aquaculture pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. The antibacterial compounds were purified and identified as alternariol (AOH) and its derivative, alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). We found that AOH and AME primarily inhibited pathogenic bacteria (MRSA or V. anguillarum) by disordering cell division and some other key physiological and biochemical processes. We further demonstrated that AOH could effectively inhibit the unwinding activity of MRSA topoisomerases, which are closely related to cell division and are the potential action target of AOH. The antibacterial activities of AOH and AME were verified by using zebrafish as the in vivo model. Notably, AOH and AME did not significantly affect the viability of normal human liver cells at concentrations that effectively inhibited MRSA or V. anguillarum. Finally, we developed the genetic operation system of A. alternata FB1 and blocked the biosynthesis of AME by knocking out omtI (encoding an O-methyl transferase), which facilitated A. alternata FB1 to only produce AOH. The development of this system in the marine fungus will accelerate the discovery of novel natural products and further bioactivity study.IMPORTANCEMore and more scientific reports indicate that alternariol (AOH) and its derivative alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) exhibit antibacterial activities. However, limited exploration of their detailed antibacterial mechanisms has been performed. In the present study, the antibacterial mechanisms of AOH and AME produced by the marine fungus Alternaria alternata FB1 were disclosed in vitro and in vivo. Given their low toxicity on the normal human liver cell line under the concentrations exhibiting significant antibacterial activity against different pathogens, AOH and AME are proposed to be good candidates for developing promising antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio anguillarum. We also succeeded in blocking the biosynthesis of AME, which facilitated us to easily obtain pure AOH. Moreover, based on our previous results, A. alternata FB1 was shown to enable polyethylene degradation.","Li R., Su Z., Sun C., Wu S.",10.1128/aem.00058-24,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Antibiotic Usage In The Covid-19 Intensive Care Unit Of An Infectious Diseases Hospital From Nord-Eastern Romania,"Background and Objectives. The intensive care unit (ICU), especially in an infectious disease hospital, is both an area with a high consumption of antibiotics (atb) and a ""reservoir"" of multidrug-resistant bacteria. We proposed the analysis of antibiotic therapy practices in such a department that treated, in conditions of a pandemic wave, patients with COVID-19 and its complications. Materials and Methods. This was a retrospective transversal study of 184 COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU of a regional infectious disease hospital of Iaşi, Romania, in a 3-month interval of 2020 and 2021. Results. All the included patients (Caucasians, 53% males, with a median age of 68 years, and a Charlton comorbidity index of 3) received at least one antibiotic during their stay in the ICU (43% also had antibiotics prior to hospital admission and 68% in the Infectious Diseases ward). Only 22.3% of the ICU patients had only one antibiotic. A total of 77.7% of them started with an association of two antibiotics, and 19.6% of them received more than three antibiotics. The most-used ones were linezolid (77.2%), imipenem (75.5%), and ceftriaxone (33.7%). The median atb duration was 9 days. No change in the number or type of atb prescription was seen in 2021 (compared to 2020). Only 9.8% of the patients had a microbiological confirmation of bacterial infection. A total of 38.3% of the tested patients had elevated procalcitonin levels at ICU admission. The overall fatality rate was 68.5%, with no significant differences between the two analyzed periods or the number of administered antibiotics. More than half (51.1%) of the patients developed oral candidiasis during their stay in the ICU, but only 5.4% had C. difficile colitis. Conclusion. Antibiotics were widely used in our ICU patients in the presence of a reduced microbiological confirmation of a bacterial co-infection, and were justified by other clinical or biological criteria.","Vâţă A., Roşu F.M., Dorneanu O.S., Lehaci A.E., Luca Ş., Loghin I.I., Miftode I.D., Luca C.M., Miftode E.G.",10.3390/medicina59040645,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)"
Ph-Responsive Double-Enzyme Active Metal–Organic Framework For Promoting The Healing Of Infected Wounds,"The abuse of antibiotics accelerates the spread and evolution of drug-resistant bacteria, which seriously threatens human health. Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are generated by peroxidase in the presence of H(2)O(2), which is strongly oxidizing and can effectively kill bacteria. However, high production costs and poor stability limit the clinical use of natural enzymes. “Nanozyme” is a general term for nanomaterials with catalytic activity similar to that of biological enzymes. Compared to biological enzymes, nanozymes have the advantages of low cost, facile preparation, and easy storage, making them a good choice for the development of antibacterial agents. Here, a nickel-based metal–organic framework (Ni-MOF) with dual enzymatic activity that switches depending on the pH environment was studied. In a slightly acidic environment, Ni-MOF can react with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals that kill bacteria; in a neutral environment, Ni-MOF instead removes excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotes the transformation of macrophages into M2 macrophages. Compared to most nanozymes, Ni-MOF has unique electrical conductivity and better biosafety. The results of animal experiments show that Ni-MOF can not only treat infected wounds but also promote the healing of acute wounds and exhibits great clinical application potential.","Chen Z., Shan J., Niu Q., Chen H., Zhang W., Cao D., Wang X.",10.1016/j.jcis.2023.11.143,Journal Of Colloid And Interface Science
Dipeptide-Based Photoreactive Instant Glue For Environmental And Biomedical Applications,"Nature-inspired smart materials offer numerous advantages over environmental friendliness and efficiency. Emulating the excellent adhesive properties of mussels foot proteins, where the lysine is in close proximity with the 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (DOPA), we report the synthesis of a novel photocurable peptide-based adhesive consisting exclusively of these two amino acids. Our adhesive is a highly concentrated aqueous solution of a monomer, a cross-linker, and a photoinitiator. Lap-shear adhesion measurements on plastic and glass surfaces and comparison with different types of commercial adhesives showed that the adhesive strength of our glue is comparable when applied in air and superior when used underwater. No toxicity of our adhesive was observed when the cytocompatibility on human dermal fibroblast cells was assessed. Preliminary experiments with various tissues and coral fragments showed that our adhesive could be applied to wound healing and coral reef restoration. Given the convenience of the facile synthesis, biocompatibility, ease of application underwater, and high adhesive strength, we expect that our adhesive may find application, but not limited, to the biomedical and environmental field.","Bilalis P., Alrashoudi A.Α., Susapto H.H., Moretti M., Alshehri S., Abdelrahman S., Elsakran A., Hauser C.A.E.",10.1021/acsami.3c10726,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Single-Cell Analysis Of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines Reveals Diverse Expression Patterns Of Individual Cells Invoked By A Molecular Target Drug Treatment,"Background: To understand the heterogeneous behaviors of individual cancer cells, it is essential to investigate gene expression levels as well as their divergence between different individual cells. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing-related technologies have enabled us to conduct a single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of a series of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Results: We analyze a total of 336 single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from seven cell lines. The results are highly robust regarding both average expression levels and the relative gene expression differences between individual cells. Gene expression diversity is characteristic depending on genes and pathways. Analyses of individual cells treated with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib reveal that, while the ribosomal genes and many other so-called house-keeping genes reduce their relative expression diversity during the drug treatment, the genes that are directly targeted by vandetanib, the EGFR and RET genes, remain constant. Rigid transcriptional control of these genes may not allow plastic changes of their expression with the drug treatment or during the cellular acquisition of drug resistance. Additionally, we find that the gene expression patterns of cancer-related genes are sometimes more diverse than expected based on the founder cells. Furthermore, we find that this diversity is occasionally latent in a normal state and initially becomes apparent after the drug treatment. Conclusions: Characteristic patterns in gene expression divergence, which would not be revealed by transcriptome analysis of bulk cells, may also play important roles when cells acquire drug resistance, perhaps by providing a cellular reservoir for gene expression programs.","Suzuki A., Matsushima K., Makinoshima H., Sugano S., Kohno T., Tsuchihara K., Suzuki Y.",10.1186/s13059-015-0636-y,Genome Biology
A Novel Strategy To Enhance Inhibition Of Hela Cervical Cancer By Combining Lentinus Β-Glucan And Autophagic Flux Blockage,"Lentinus β-D-glucan (LNT), derived from artificially cultured mushrooms of Lentinus edodes, shows an important yet incompletely understood biological functions in cancer. In this work, the chemical structure of the refined LNT comprising a β-D-(1, 6)-branched β-D-(1,3)-glucan was further clarified via 1D- and 2D-NMR with high resolution, and its drug resistance resulted from autophagy in human cervical cancer (CC) Hela cells besides its anti-cancer function were revealed in vitro and in vivo. In detail, LNT destroyed cellular homeostasis by significantly increasing the intracellular Ca(2+) levels and promoted autophagic flux in vitro Hela cells, which was found to at least partially depend on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathway by up-regulating LC3-II levels and down-regulating the expression of p62, PI3K, p-Akt, and mTOR in Hela cells-transplanted BALB/c nude mice. In particular, LNT-induced autophagy led to a drug resistance against LNT-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in Hela cells, and the co-treatment of autophagy inhibitors and LNT significantly enhanced the inhibition of Hela cells and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of LNT and autophagy inhibitors will be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce the resistance and improve the prognosis of CC patients in the clinical.","Hu S., Meng Y., Guo L., Xu X.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.136309,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
A Biomaterial Screening Approach Reveals Microenvironmental Mechanisms Of Drug Resistance,"Traditional drug screening methods lack features of the tumor microenvironment that contribute to resistance. Most studies examine cell response in a single biomaterial platform in depth, leaving a gap in understanding how extracellular signals such as stiffness, dimensionality, and cell-cell contacts act independently or are integrated within a cell to affect either drug sensitivity or resistance. This is critically important, as adaptive resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment. We developed an approach to screen drug responses in cells cultured on 2D and in 3D biomaterial environments to explore how key features of ECM mediate drug response. This approach uncovered that cells on 2D hydrogels and spheroids encapsulated in 3D hydrogels were less responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeting drugs sorafenib and lapatinib, but not cytotoxic drugs, compared to single cells in hydrogels and cells on plastic. We found that transcriptomic differences between these in vitro models and tumor xenografts did not reveal mechanisms of ECM-mediated resistance to sorafenib. However, a systems biology analysis of phospho-kinome data uncovered that variation in MEK phosphorylation was associated with RTK-targeted drug resistance. Using sorafenib as a model drug, we found that co-administration with a MEK inhibitor decreased ECM-mediated resistance in vitro and reduced in vivo tumor burden compared to sorafenib alone. In sum, we provide a novel strategy for identifying and overcoming ECM-mediated resistance mechanisms by performing drug screening, phospho-kinome analysis, and systems biology across multiple biomaterial environments.","Schwartz A.D., Barney L.E., Jansen L.E., Nguyen T.V., Hall C.L., Meyer A.S., Peyton S.R.",10.1039/c7ib00128b,Integrative Biology (United Kingdom)
Characterization Of Mannheimia Haemolytica Biofilm Formation In Vitro,"Mannheimia haemolytica is the primary bacterial agent in the bovine respiratory disease complex. It is thought that M. haemolytica colonizes the tonsillar crypts of cattle as a commensal and subsequently descends into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacterial species persist in the host as biofilms. There is limited information about the ability of M. haemolytica to form biofilms. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model for M. haemolytica biofilm formation. We found that M. haemolytica required at least 36h to form robust biofilms on plastic in vitro when incubated in RPMI-1640 tissue culture medium at 37°C, with maximal biofilm formation being evident at 48h. Biofilm formation was inhibited by adding the monosaccharides d(+) galactose and d(+) mannose to the growth medium. Addition of antibodies to the M. haemolytica surface protein OmpA also reduced biofilm formation. Upon evaluating the macromolecules within the biofilm extracellular polymeric substance we found it contained 9.7μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of protein, 0.81μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of total carbohydrate, and 0.47μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of extracellular DNA. Furthermore, proteinase K treatment significantly decreased biofilms (P<0.05) while α-amylase and micrococcal nuclease decreased biofilms to a lesser extent. M. haemolytica biofilm cells were more resistant than planktonic cells to the antibiotics florfenicol, gentamicin, and tulathromycin. These results provide evidence that M. haemolytica can form biofilms, which could contribute to its ability to persist as a commensal in the bovine upper respiratory tract.","Boukahil I., Czuprynski C.J.",10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.11.012,Veterinary Microbiology
Eradication And Sensitization Of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus To Methicillin With Bioactive Extracts Of Berry Pomace,"The therapeutic roles of phenolic blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomace (commercial byproduct) extracts (BPE) and their mechanism of actions were evaluated against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Five major phenolic acids of BPE, e.g., protocatechuic, p. coumaric, vanillic, caffeic, and gallic acids, as well as crude BPE completely inhibited the growth of vegetative MRSA in vitro while BPE+methicillin significantly reduced MRSA biofilm formation on plastic surface. In addition, BPE restored the effectiveness of methicillin against MRSA by down-regulating the expression of methicillin resistance (mecA) and efflux pump (norA, norB, norC, mdeA, sdrM, and sepA) genes. Antibiogram with broth microdilution method showed that MIC of methicillin reduced from 512 μg/mL to 4 μg/mL when combined with only 200 μg Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/mL of BPE. Significant reduction in MRSA adherence to and invasion into human skin keratinocyte Hek001 cells were also noticed in the presence of BPE. BPE induced anti-apoptosis and anti-autophagy pathways through overexpression of Bcl-2 gene and down-regulation of TRADD and Bax genes (inducers of apoptosis pathway) in Hek001 cells. In summary, novel and sustainable prophylactic therapy can be developed with BPE in combination with currently available antibiotics, especially methicillin, against skin and soft tissue infections with MRSA.","Salaheen S., Peng M., Joo J., Teramoto H., Biswas D.",10.3389/fmicb.2017.00253,Frontiers In Microbiology
An Antibacterial Biologic Patch Based On Bacterial Cellulose For Repair Of Infected Hernias,"Infection-associated complications and repair failures and antibiotic resistance have emerged as a formidable challenge in hernia repair surgery. Consequently, the development of antibiotic-free antibacterial patches for hernia repair has become an exigent clinical necessity. Herein, a GBC/Gel/LL37 biological patch (biopatch) with exceptional antibacterial properties is fabricated by grafting 2-Methacryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride (METAC), a unique quaternary ammonium salt with vinyl, onto bacterial cellulose (GBC), followed by compounding with gelatin (Gel) and LL37. The GBC/Gel/LL37 biopatch exhibits stable swelling capacity, remarkable mechanical properties, flexibility, and favorable biocompatibility. The synergistic effect of METAC and LL37 confers upon the GBC/Gel/LL37 biopatch excellent antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, effectively eliminating invading bacteria without the aid of exogenous antibiotics in vivo while significantly reducing local acute inflammation caused by infection. Furthermore, the practical efficacy of the GBC/Gel/LL37 biopatch is evaluated in an infected ventral hernia model, revealing that the GBC/Gel/LL37 biopatch can prevent the formation of visceral adhesions, facilitate the repair of infected ventral hernia, and effectively mitigate chronic inflammation. The prepared antibacterial GBC/Gel/LL37 biopatch is very effective in dealing with the risk of infection in hernia repair surgery and offers potential clinical opportunities for other soft injuries, exhibiting considerable clinical application prospects.","He P., Wang D., Zheng R., Wang H., Fu L., Tang G., Shi Z., Wu Y., Yang G.",10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.121942,Carbohydrate Polymers
What Is The Science Underpinning The Prescription Of Antibiotics In Dentistry?,"DESIGN: A critical review on the use of antimicrobials in dentistry. AIM: To provide a general overview of the use of antimicrobials in dentistry. METHODS: The paper was divided into different topics, starting with an approach to understanding both commensal and pathogenic oral microbiota. Subsequently, emphasis was placed on the main categories of antibiotics used in dentistry (β-lactams, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, nitroimidazoles and quinolones), and the basis for their prescription. Finally, the implications between systemic diseases and the use of orally-administered antibiotics are presented. RESULTS: The study suggests that an adequate medical history can minimize the risk of systemic adverse effects, unwanted drug interactions, and allergies related to the use of antibiotics. In this regard, when facing a potential history of allergy to a particular group of antibiotics, the prescription of a different group is mandatory. In most indications, β-lactam antibiotics represent the first-choice in dentistry. Moreover, a short-term prescription of antibiotics when treating acute oral infections is recommended. The use should be extended for 2 to 3 days following the resolution of the infection, with an average duration of 6 days in order to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Oral infections should be managed with interventions aiming at the elimination/reduction of the associated pathogens. Furthermore, inadequate prescription of antibiotics can lead to potential risks to the patient such as allergy, adverse effects, and development of microbial resistance.","Amaral A.L., Herrera D., Lund B., Andrade S.A.",10.1038/s41432-024-01031-5,Evidence-Based Dentistry
Use Of Phage Cocktail Bfc 1.10 In Combination With Ceftazidime-Avibactam In The Treatment Of Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Femur Osteomyelitis—A Case Report,"High-energy trauma with severe bone fractures can be complicated by infection, leading to the development of osteomyelitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important causative agent of such infections because of its high virulence profile and ability to develop resistance against a wide range of antimicrobials quickly. P. aeruginosa biofilms cause treatment failure and relapsing infections. Bacteriophages are viruses that can be used to treat biofilm-associated infections. Moreover, the combination of phages with certain antimicrobials have demonstrated synergistic and additive effects. We present a case of a 21-year-old patient with relapsing multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa femur osteomyelitis that developed after a road accident, with a proximal right femoral Grade III B open fracture and severe soft tissue damage. Despite extensive antimicrobial treatment and multiple surgical interventions with wound debridement, the infection persisted, with subsequent development of femoral osteomyelitis with a fistula. Patient care management included femoral head excision with wound debridement, intravenous (IV) ceftazidime-avibactam, and the local application of the lytic Pseudomonas bacteriophage cocktail BFC 1.10. Nine months after the intervention, the patient did not show any clinical, radiological, or laboratory signs of inflammation; therefore, hip replacement was performed. Nevertheless, recurrent P. aeruginosa infection evolved at the distal side of the femur and was successfully treated with conventional antimicrobials. In this case, wound debridement combined with antibiotics and bacteriophages resulted in bacterial eradication of proximal femoral segment, avoiding leg amputation, but failed to treat osteomyelitis in distal bone segment. An in vitro assessment of the isolated MDR P. aeruginosa strain for biofilm formation and phage susceptibility was performed. Additionally, the antimicrobial effects of ceftazidime-avibactam and BFC 1.10 were determined on planktonic cell growth and bacterial biofilm prevention was evaluated. The isolated bacterial strains were susceptible to the bacteriophage cocktail. Strong biofilm formation was detected 6 h after inoculation. Ceftazidime-avibactam combined with BFC 1.10 was most effective in preventing planktonic cell growth and biofilm formation. In both cases, the required concentration of ceftazidime-avibactam decreased two-fold. This study demonstrates the possible use of bacteriophages and antibiotics in difficult-to-treat bone and soft tissue infections, where the additive effects of phages and antibiotics were observed.","Racenis K., Rezevska D., Madelane M., Lavrinovics E., Djebara S., Petersons A., Kroica J.",10.3389/fmed.2022.851310,Frontiers In Medicine
"A Tissue-Adhesive, Mechanically Enhanced, Natural Aloe Vera-Based Injectable Hydrogel For Wound Healing: Macrophage Mediation And Collagen Proliferation","Macromolecule hydrogels made from natural extracts have received much attention because of their favorable biocompatibility and wound healing properties. However, their clinical applications are limited by their insufficient mechanical strength and low adhesion properties. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel injectable Aloe vera hydrogel (PDMA-GelMA@AV). By integrating gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and polydopamine methacrylamide (PDMA), we significantly improved the mechanical and adhesion properties of the hydrogel. The PDMA-GelMA@AV hydrogel degraded in a simulated wound environment, which was synchronized with the sustained release of the bioactive components of A. vera. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that this hydrogel has good biocompatibility. In vitro studies also revealed that the sustained release of the active ingredients of A. vera promoted fibroblast proliferation and migration and increased the expression of key proteins and mRNAs required for wound healing. In addition, it modulated LPS-stimulated macrophages and decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS while increasing the expression of TGF-β and ARG. In vivo experiments further confirmed the efficacy of hydrogels in wound healing applications. These findings offer a novel perspective on the application of natural macromolecules as hydrogel-based delivery vehicles in wound care.","Wang X., Yang J., Zhao Q., Xie X., Deng F., Wang Z., Jiang K., Li X., Liu H., Shi Z., Zhu X., Chen L., Lv D.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.137452,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
Microplastics Aggravate The Bioaccumulation Of Two Waterborne Veterinary Antibiotics In An Edible Bivalve Species: Potential Mechanisms And Implications For Human Health,"Edible bivalves are one of the major types of seafood and may be subject to antibiotic and microplastics (MPs) coexposure under realistic scenarios. However, the effect of MPs on the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in edible bivalves and subsequent health risks for consumers remain poorly understood. Therefore, the bioaccumulation of two frequently detected veterinary antibiotics, oxytetracycline (OTC) and florfenicol (FLO), with or without the copresence of MPs was investigated in the blood clam. Health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated clams were also assessed. Furthermore, the activity of GST and expression of key detoxification genes were analyzed as well. The bioaccumulation of OTC and FLO in clams was found to be aggravated by MPs. Because the estimated target hazard quotients (THQs) were far less than the critical value, direct toxic effects of consuming contaminated clams are negligible. However, the dietary exposure doses of the human gut microbiota (DEGM) to the antibiotics tested were greater than or similar to corresponding minimum selective concentrations (MSC), indicating a potential antibiotic resistance risk. Moreover, the GST activity and expression of detoxification genes were significantly suppressed by MPs, suggesting that the disruption of detoxification represents one possible explanation for the aggravated bioaccumulation observed here.","Zhou W., Han Y., Tang Y., Shi W., Du X., Sun S., Liu G.",10.1021/acs.est.0c01575,Environmental Science And Technology
How To: Assess Patient Suitability For Unlicensed Phage Therapy In The United Kingdom,"Background: Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising alternative antimicrobial approach that has the potential to transform the way we treat bacterial infections. The antibiotic resistance crisis is driving renewed interest in phage therapy. There are currently no licensed phage therapy medicinal products and phage therapy is used in small but growing patient numbers on an unlicensed basis. Objectives: This article provides guidelines on the assessment of patient suitability for unlicensed phage therapy for clinicians in the United Kingdom. Sources: This article builds on Health Improvement Scotland's recommendation for the consideration of phage therapy in difficult-to-treat infections and the experience of the author group, who have collectively assessed the suitability of 30 patients for phage therapy. Content: In the United Kingdom, unlicenced medicines, including phages, may be considered to meet special clinical needs. The use of unlicenced medicines is governed by national legislation and local National Health Service trust policies. Phages can be used in any National Health Service trust and decisions about suitability should be made through existing local clinical management pathways. This article sets out guidelines to support local clinical teams in the assessment of patient suitability for phage therapy. Clinical and microbiological considerations are presented, including allergy and pregnancy. Implications: The assessment of patient suitability for phage therapy is within the scope of local clinical teams. Local assessment through existing clinical management pathways will develop confidence and competence in phage therapy among clinical teams nationally and ensure timely patient care.","Jones J.D., Stacey H.J., Kennedy J.W., Merabishvilli M., Haines M.E.K., Blocker O., Dharmasena K., Gordon A., Hamilton S.A., Aggarwal I., Nagy J., Urquhart D.S., Hall L.M.L., Young M.J., Macgregor G., Langley R.J., Peters C., Munteanu D.I.",10.1016/j.cmi.2024.07.022,Clinical Microbiology And Infection
Secondary Metabolites From Food-Derived Yeasts Inhibit Virulence Of Candida Albicans,"A sparse number of available antifungal drugs, therapeutic side effects, and drug resistance are major challenges in current antifungal therapy to treat Candida albicans-associated infections. Here, we describe two food-derived yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatchenkia occidentalis, that inhibit virulence traits of C. albicans, including hyphal morphogenesis, biofilm formation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. These yeasts also protect the model host Caenorhabditis elegans from C. albicans infection. We demonstrate that the protective activity is primarily retained in the secretome of the beneficial yeasts, and the protection they provide as a physical barrier is negligible. S. cerevisiae aro8 aro9 mutant analysis demonstrate that phenylethanol and tryptophol are necessary for protection, and experiments with commercially procured compounds indicate that they are sufficient to inhibit C. albicans virulence. We propose food-derived yeasts as an alternative or combination therapy to conventional antifungal therapy for C. albicans infection.","Kunyeit L., Kurrey N.K., Anu-Appaiah K.A., Rao R.P.",10.1128/mBio.01891-21,Mbio
The Effect Of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells On Full-Thickness Skin Grafts,"Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ASCs on full-thickness skin grafts. Specifically, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of ASCs that are mediated via regulation of the phenotypes of activated macrophages. Methods. ASCs were isolated, cultured, and injected under full-thickness skin grafts in 15 rats (ASC group). An additional 15 rats served as controls (PBS group). Skin graft survival assessment and vascularization detection were assessed with H&E staining and laser Doppler blood flowmetry (LDF). The effects of ASCs on angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, collagen accumulation-promoting, and antiscarring were assessed. Results. We found that the skin graft survival rate was significantly increased in the ASC group. The neovascularization, collagen deposition, collagen type I to type III ratio, and levels of VEGF and TGF-β3 in the ASC group were markedly higher than those in the PBS group at day 14. Additionally, in the ASC group, the levels of iNOS, IL-1β, and TNF-α were remarkably decreased, whereas the levels of IL-10 and Arg-1 were substantially increased. Conclusions. Our results confirm that ASCs transplantation can effectively improve full-thickness skin graft survival. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory role of ASCs may indirectly contribute to skin graft survival via its effect on macrophage polarization.","Wang J., Hao H., Huang H., Chen D., Han Y., Han W.",10.1155/2016/1464725,Biomed Research International
Contemporary Review And Case Report Of Botulinum Resistance In Facial Synkinesis,"Background: Botulinum resistance poses significant treatment challenges for both patients and healthcare practitioners. We first present a case highlighting botulinum resistance in a patient who failed to respond to alternative formulations but who responded remarkably to incobotulinum toxinA, an identical toxin free of complexing proteins. Secondly, we provide a treatment algorithm and a review of the literature detailing clinical and immunochemical botulinum resistance. Results: Patients with botulinum resistance show a predisposition to failure on subsequent injections and possess a propensity toward neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody development. The mechanisms of resistance are not entirely understood but thought to be secondary to an immunologic response. Risk factors for resistance include higher botulinum doses, more frequent injections, and high total lifetime dosage. Patients may still respond to other botulinum formulations or subtypes; however, this effect may be temporary. Conclusion: This case report describes a patient who responded to incobotulinum toxinA after failing treatment with the identical toxin compounded with buffer proteins, ultimately supporting the possibility of immune-mediated resistance to the surrounding proteins and not the toxin itself. Often, impending treatment resistance is preceded by a poor or limited clinical response. Antibody testing is not indicated because it is neither sensitive nor specific and does not change clinical practice. Initially, higher doses of botulinum may overcome resistance without increasing treatment frequency, and side effects are far less common in those with clinical resistance. If higher dosages fail to produce a response, alternative botulinum formulations or subtypes can be considered.

"Novel Circular Rna, Hsa_Circ_0025039 Promotes Cell Growth, Invasion And Glucose Metabolism In Malignant Melanoma Via The Mir-198/Cdk4 Axis","Malignant melanoma, a tumor derived from melanocytes, shows severe drug resistance and prompt metastasis, causing a serious threat to human health. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in mammals and have been indicated to play important roles in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the variability of circRNAs in malignant melanoma by microarray and identified six differentially expressed circRNAs. In particular, we found that hsa_circ_0025039, which is formed by FOXM1 exons, is significantly upregulated in melanoma. In vitro, the knockdown of circ_0025039 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation ability, invasion and glucose metabolism in melanoma cells. Additionally, we identified miR-198 as a direct target of hsa_circ_0025039. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hsa_circ_0025039 regulates CDK4 expression by sponging miR-198. In vivo study indicated that the silencing of hsa_circ_0025039 inhibits melanoma tumor formation and downregulates miR-198 and CDK4 expression. Taken together, our data showed that circ_0025039 promotes cell growth, invasion and glucose metabolism in malignant melanoma by sponging miR-198 and regulating CDK4.","Bian D., Wu Y., Song G.",10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.152,Biomedicine And Pharmacotherapy
Activation Of Murine Microglial N9 Cells Is Attenuated Through Cannabinoid Receptor Cb2 Signaling,"Inhibition of microglial activation is effective in treating various neurological disorders. Activation of microglial cannabinoid CB2 receptor induces anti-inflammatory effects, and the mechanism, however, is still elusive. Microglia could be activated into the classic activated state (M1 state) or the alternative activated state (M2 state), the former is cytotoxic, and the latter is neurotrophic. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFNγ) to activate N9 microglia and hypothesized the pretreatment with cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist AM1241 attenuates microglial activation by shifting microglial M1 to M2 state. We found that pretreatment with 5 μM AM1241 at 1 h before microglia were exposed to LPS plus IFNγ decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the release of pro-inflammatory factors, increased the expression of arginase 1 (Arg-1) and the release of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors in microglia. However, these effects induced by AM1241 pretreatment were significantly reversed in the presence of 10 μM cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 or 10 μM protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine. These findings indicated that AM1241 pretreatment attenuates microglial activation by shifting M1 to M2 activated state via CB2 receptor, and the AM1241-induced anti-inflammatory effects may be mediated by PKC.","Ma L., Jia J., Liu X., Bai F., Wang Q., Xiong L.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.073,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Antibiotic Prophylaxis In Skin Graft Surgery: A Protocol,"Introduction: There is little evidence-based guidance on the use of prophylactic antibiotics in skin surgery; whilst antibiotics may protect against surgical site infections (SSI), they have associated side effects, increase the risk of adverse events, and can propagate antibiotic resistance. We present a protocol for a systematic review to establish whether the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics overrides the risk, for patients undergoing autograft surgery. Methods: The systematic review will be registered a priori on researchregistry.com and will be conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). A search strategy will be devised to investigate ‘skin graft surgery and use of antibiotics’. The following electronic databases will be searched, 1979–2018: PubMed, MEDLINE® EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SciELO, The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE), the Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, the NHS Economic Evaluation Databases and Cochrane Groups, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials Database, the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, UpToDate.com, NHS Evidence and the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Grey literature will be searched. All comparative study designs reporting on the use of antibiotics in skin graft surgery will be considered for inclusion, namely randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two trained independent teams will screen all titles and abstracts, followed by relevant full texts, for eligibility. Data will be extracted under standardized extraction fields into a preformatted database. Note will be made of the indication for skin graft surgery (traumatic, congenital, malignant, benign), the graft site (head & neck, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities), type of skin graft (split thickness, full-thickness). The primary outcome will be occurrence of SSI at the donor and/or recipient sites. Secondary outcomes, if reported, will include: length of hospital stay, revision surgery required, cost of medical care, time to wound healing and cosmetic outcome. Ethics and dissemination: The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at national and international meetings within fields of plastic, reconstructive, and aesthetic surgery. The work will be disseminated electronically and in print. Brief reports of the review and findings will be disseminated to interested parties through email and direct communication. The review aims to guide healthcare practice and policy.","Borrelli M.R., Sinha V., Landin M.L., Chicco M., Echlin K., Agha R.A., Ross A.M.",10.1016/j.isjp.2019.02.001,International Journal Of Surgery Protocols
Decellularization Of Submillimeter-Diameter Vascular Scaffolds Using Peracetic Acid,"Various decellularization methods for allogenic and xenogenic bioscaffolds have been previously reported; however, decellularization methods for very thin (submillimeter-diameter) vascular tissues have not been discussed well. In this study, rat tail arteries (inner diameter, 0.6 mm) were decellularized with peracetic acid (PAA) and DNase I. PAA treatment is expected not only to disrupt cell membranes which improves the decellularization efficiency in the subsequent DNase treatment, but also to sterilize vascular scaffolds. We succeeded in adequate cell removal by immersing in 0.3% isotonic PAA solution and subsequent washing with DNase solution. For the DNase washing process, the perfusion method was superior in terms of cell removal to the static immersion method. Graft lumen was modified with a peptide composed of a collagen binding sequence and endothelial progenitor cell-binding sequence, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)(7)-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Glu-Asp-Val, as previously reported. They were patent in rat allogeneic transplantation model for 2 weeks, but unexpectedly resulted in graft rupture or tear formation, thereafter, suggesting reduced mechanical strength of the decellularized scaffolds. Histology showed that the thickness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) was decreased by the perfusion of the DNase solution. The method of combination of PAA and DNase was not necessarily optimal for the decellularization of very thin vascular tissues. The decellularization method is a compromise between effective cell removal and maintenance of the ECM nature. Since the acceptability of ECM denaturation by the host tissue highly depends on individual cases, decellularization methods should be carefully selected according to the type of target tissue and its intended use.","Yamanaka H., Morimoto N., Yamaoka T.",10.1007/s10047-019-01152-0,Journal Of Artificial Organs
A Thermosensitive Rgd-Modified Hydroxybutyl Chitosan Hydrogel As A 3D Scaffold For Bmscs Culture On Keloid Treatment,"Cell therapy with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is a potential method for many disease treatments, including keloid. In the present study, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) modified hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) hydrogel (HBC-RGD) was developed to enhance the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs within the hydrogel. The successful synthesis of HBC-RGD was confirmed by FTIR and (1)H NMR. Both HBC and HBC-RGD hydrogel had desired thermosensitivity, biocompatibility and enzymatic degradability in vitro. Compared with HBC hydrogel, HBC-RGD hydrogel was more beneficial for the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs. Furthermore, the BMSCs incorporated HBC-RGD (BMSCs/HBC-RGD) hydrogel could inhibit the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts (Kfs) and suppress the nodular collagenous fibers of keloid tissue. These results suggested that the HBC-RGD hydrogel could be applied as a potential 3D hydrogel scaffold for cell culture, and BMSCs/HBC-RGD hydrogel was potential to be applied for keloid therapy with subcutaneous in-situ injection in the future.","Qu C., Bao Z., Zhang X., Wang Z., Ren J., Zhou Z., Tian M., Cheng X., Chen X., Feng C.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.058,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
"The Intimate Relationship Among Emt, Met And Tme: A T(Ransdifferentiation) E(Nhancing) M(Ix) To Be Exploited For Therapeutic Purposes","Intratumoral heterogeneity is considered the major cause of drug unresponsiveness in cancer and accumulating evidence implicates non-mutational resistance mechanisms rather than genetic mutations in its development. These non-mutational processes are largely driven by phenotypic plasticity, which is defined as the ability of a cell to reprogram and change its identity (phenotype switching). Tumor cell plasticity is characterized by the reactivation of developmental programs that are closely correlated with the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties and an enhanced potential for retrodifferentiation or transdifferentiation. A well-studied mechanism of phenotypic plasticity is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Current evidence suggests a complex interplay between EMT, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and clues from the tumor microenvironment in cell reprogramming. A deeper understanding of the connections between stem cell, epithelial–mesenchymal, and tumor-associated reprogramming events is crucial to develop novel therapies that mitigate cell plasticity and minimize the evolution of tumor heterogeneity, and hence drug resistance. Alternatively, vulnerabilities exposed by tumor cells when residing in a plastic or stem-like state may be exploited therapeutically, i.e., by converting them into less aggressive or even postmitotic cells. Tumor cell plasticity thus presents a new paradigm for understanding a cancer’s resistance to therapy and deciphering its underlying mechanisms.","Hass R., Von Der Ohe J., Ungefroren H.",10.3390/cancers12123674,Cancers
Human Wharton'S Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome Display Antiproliferative Effect On Leukemia Cell Line And Produce Additive Cytotoxic Effect In Combination With Doxorubicin,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy moves toward clinic progressively. Recent evidences establish anticancer effect of mesenchymal stem cells. However multiple factors including type of cancer, MSC source, study design, and animal model play role in final outcome. Wharton's jelly - a newly approved source of MSCs - possesses superiorities to bone marrow as the conventional source; therefore investigation of its medical effects can produce beneficial results. In this survey we examined cytotoxic and proapoptotic effect of human Wharton's jelly MSC secretome on K562 human leukemia cells.MSCs were isolated from human Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord by explant culture method, then characterized according to ISCT criteria (morphology and plastic adherence, surface antigenicity and differentiation potential). MSC secretome was collected and its cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects on K562 cells in combination with doxorubicin were evaluated using BrdU cell proliferation assay and Annexin V-PI staining.Our results showed antiproliferative effect of mesenchymal stem cell secretome on K562 cancer cells, the effect was also added to cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin without induction of drug resistance. Human Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells exerted cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells. Addition of that effect to anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents can leads to cytotoxic drug dose reduction and diminished side effects.","Hendijani F., Haghjooy Javanmard S., Sadeghi-Aliabadi H.",10.1016/j.tice.2015.01.005,Tissue And Cell
Downregulation Of Lncrna Tslnc8 Promotes Melanoma Resistance To Braf Inhibitor Plx4720 Through Binding With Pp1Α To Re-Activate Mapk Signaling,"Purpose: Approximately 60% of patients with melanoma harbor BRAF mutation and targeting BRAF offers enormous advance in the treatment of those patients. Unfortunately, the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitors is usually restricted by the onset of drug resistance. Therefore, better understanding of the adaptive drug resistance mechanisms is essential for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies, and offers more promising measures to promote the short duration of response to BRAF inhibitors. Methods: The levels of tumor suppressive long noncoding RNA on chromosome 8p12 (TSLNC8) were evaluated by qPCR. The MTT assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis assay, and in vivo xenograft tumor model were performed to assess the functions of TSLNC8 on drug resistance. Western blotting, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were applied to investigate the mechanisms of TSLNC8 in melanoma. Results: Herein, our findings demonstrate that TSLNC8 is significantly downregulated in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma tissues and cells. Moreover, downregulation of TSLNC8 in BRAF inhibitor sensitive cells reduces the toxicity response to BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, and inhibits apoptosis of melanoma cells-treated with PLX4720. Further assay elucidates that TSLNC8 can bind with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) to regulate its distribution, and Downregulation of TSLNC8 results in PP1α cytoplasmic accumulation, thus re-activating the MAPK signaling. Eventually, the overexpression of TSLNC8 in BRAF inhibitor PLX4720-resistant melanoma cells restores the sensitive to BRAF inhibitor. Conclusion: Collectively, our research provides a compelling rationale for resistance to BRAF inhibitor in melanoma, and the patient might benefit from the combinatorial therapy of BRAF inhibitors and lncRNA TSLNC8.","Han Y., Fang J., Xiao Z., Deng J., Zhang M., Gu L.",10.1007/s00432-020-03484-4,Journal Of Cancer Research And Clinical Oncology
The Lncrna Crnde Is Regulated By E2F6 And Sensitizes Gastric Cancer Cells To Chemotherapy By Inhibiting Autophagy,"Chemotherapy is an important treatment for gastric cancer (GC), but the primary and secondary drug resistance of tumours to chemotherapy seriously affects its curative effect. In recent years, the relationship between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and malignant tumours has received increasing attention. Based on accumulating evidence, lncRNAs are involved in the chemoresistance of GC, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified the lncRNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) as an important regulator of autophagy-associated chemoresistance in GC. Mechanistically, overexpression of CRNDE inhibits autophagy and induces apoptosis, thereby sensitizing GC cells to chemotherapy drugs. Moreover, E2F6, a classical transcriptional inhibitor, is confirmed to be upregulated in GC and represses the expression of CRNDE. The E2F6-CRNDE axis is clinically related to chemoresistant GC and poor outcomes in patients with advanced GC. Our findings suggest that the E2F6-CRNDE axis is a viable therapeutic target to protect against chemoresistance in GC.","Zhang F., Chen Q., Chen P., Liu C., Wang H., Zhao L.",10.7150/jca.65871,Journal Of Cancer

Hgf/C-Met Signalling In The Tumor Microenvironment,"Recently, it has become clearer that tumor plasticity increases the chance that cancer cells could acquire new mechanisms to escape immune surveillance, become resistant to conventional drugs, and spread to distant sites. Effectively, tumor plasticity drives adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation leading to stimulation of neoangionesis or tumor escape. Therefore, tumor plasticity is believed to be a great contributor in recurrence and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Importantly, it could be an Achilles’ heel of cancer if we could identify molecular mechanisms dictating this phenotype. The reactivation of stem-like signalling pathways is considered a great determinant of tumor plasticity; in addition, a key role has been also attributed to tumor microenvironment (TME). Indeed, it has been proved that cancer cells interact with different cells in the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, well-established communication represents a potential allied in maintenance of a plastic phenotype in cancer cells supporting tumor growth and spread. An important signalling pathway mediating cancer cell-TME crosstalk is represented by the HGF/c-Met signalling. Here, we review the role of the HGF/c-Met signalling in tumor-stroma crosstalk focusing on novel findings underlying its role in tumor plasticity, immune escape, and development of adaptive mechanisms.","Zambelli A., Biamonti G., Amato A.",10.1007/978-3-030-47189-7_2,Advances In Experimental Medicine And Biology
Uptake Of Phmb In A Bacterial Nanocellulose-Based Wound Dressing: A Feasible Clinical Procedure,"Background: With the increase of antimicrobial resistance in recent decades, other methods of preventing and fighting infections must be considered. Burn patients, whose wound areas are often extensive, are especially prone to wound infections. The loading of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) with antiseptics has already been successfully performed but unfortunately, the described procedure is time-consuming and thus not applicable in a clinical emergency setting. Therefore, a clinically feasible approach was established. Material and methods: Sheets of BNC-based wound dressings were placed into antiseptic solutions containing PHMB (Prontosan(®) and LAVANID(®) 2) and were left to soak for up to two hours. At different time points, samples were analysed for their concentration of PHMB and antiseptic efficacy. Results: Within 30 min, clinically relevant concentrations of PHMB were achieved in the BNC-based wound dressing. The 30-min PHMB uptake for Prontosan(®) and LAVANID(®) 2 resulted in concentrations of 0.05% and 0.019%, respectively. Samples from the PHMB loaded dressing showed a dose dependent antiseptic efficacy for Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusion: This experiment showed that the loading of BNC-based wound dressings with PHMB-containing antiseptics was achieved by a simple and quick procedure. According to studies a PHMB concentration of 0.001% can already inhibits all bacterial growth, indicating that the concentrations of PHMB in the BNC-based wound dressings after 30 min are higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration and the antiseptic efficacy after 120 min loading analysed by an standardized bacterial disk diffusion assay was shown to be comparable to the clinically used Suprasorb(®) X + PHMB wound dressing.","De Mattos I.B., Holzer J.C.J., Tuca A.-C., Groeber-Becker F., Funk M., Popp D., Mautner S., Birngruber T., Kamolz L.-P.",10.1016/j.burns.2018.10.023,Burns

Efficacy Of A Topical Concentrated Surfactant Gel On Microbial Communities In Non-Healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers With Chronic Biofilm Infections: A Proof-Of-Concept Study,"This proof-of-concept study sought to determine the effects of standard of care (SOC) and a topically applied concentrated surfactant gel (SG) on the total microbial load, community composition, and community diversity in non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with chronic biofilm infections. SOC was provided in addition to a topical concentrated SG, applied every 2 days for 6 weeks. Wound swabs were obtained from the base of ulcers at baseline (week 0), week 1, mid-point (week 3), and end of treatment (week 6). DNA sequencing and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were employed to determine the total microbial load, community composition, and diversity of patient samples. Tissue specimens were obtained at baseline and scanning electron microscopy and peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridisation with confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to confirm the presence of biofilm in all 10 DFUs with suspected chronic biofilm infections. The application of SG resulted in 7 of 10 samples achieving a reduction in mean log10 total microbial load from baseline to end of treatment (0.8 Log10 16S copies, ±0.6), and 3 of 10 samples demonstrated an increase in mean Log10 total microbial load (0.6 log10 16S copies, ±0.8) from baseline to end of treatment. Composition changes in microbial communities were driven by changes to the most dominant bacteria. Corynebacterium sp. and Streptococcus sp. frequently reduced in relative abundance in patient samples from week 0 to week 6 but did not disappear. In contrast, Staphylococcus sp., Finegoldia sp., and Fusobacterium sp., relative abundances frequently increased in patient samples from week 0 to week 6. The application of a concentrated SG resulted in varying shifts to diversity (increase or decrease) between week 0 and week 6 samples at the individual patient level. Any shifts in community diversity were independent to changes in the total microbial loads. SOC and a topical concentrated SG directly affect the microbial loads and community composition of DFUs with chronic biofilm infections.","Malone M., Radzieta M., Schwarzer S., Jensen S.O., Lavery L.A.",10.1111/iwj.13546,International Wound Journal
Evaluation Of The Effectiveness Of Modern Antiseptics Against Multidrug-Resistant Clinical Strains Of P. Aeruginosa Isolated From Combat Wounds During Hostilities On The Territory Of Ukraine,"Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dangerous pathogens of healthcare-associated infections. Objectives: To study and evaluate the effectiveness in vitro of modern antiseptics against multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. Methods: The activity of antiseptics chlorhexidine 0.5% (CHG), polyhexanide 0.1% (PHMB), octenidine 0.1% (OCT), miramistin 0.01% (MRM), decamethoxin 0.1% (DCM), decamethoxin 0.02%, povidoneiodine 10% (PVP-I) was tested against MDR P. aeruginosa (n = 43). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined (in accordance to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, USA), and then the index of antiseptic activity (IAA) was calculated. The IAA indicator is the ratio of the working concentration of a certain antiseptic to its MIC in relation to a given microorganism. The antiseptic was considered active if the IAA was greater than four (IAA > 4). Results: Based on MIC and MBC values, DCM 0.1% (MIC = 63.24 ± 5.24 μg/ml; MBC = 107.89 ± 5.85 μg/ml), DCM 0.02% (MIC = 60.17 ± 5.05 μg/ml; MBC = 106.98 ± 9.28 μg/ml) and PHMB 0.1% (MIC = 68.68 ± 4.2 μg/ml; MBC = 103.2 ± 12.88 μg/ml) showed the highest antimicrobial activity. The bactericidal effect of DCM 0.02% against clinical strains of P. aeruginosa significantly exceeded that of CHG-by 1.81 times (p < 0.001), OCT-by 1.45 times (p = 0.01). The bactericidal activity of PHMB was significantly higher than that of CHG by 1.88 times (p < 0.01), OCT-by 1.51 times (p < 0.05). The highest IAA values were determined for PHMB 0.1% (IAA = 16.0), OCT 0.1% (IAA = 20.0), DCM 0.1% (IAA = 21.34), PVP-I 10% (IAA = 46.74). The concentration of 0.01% MRM was too low to determine MBC, and the IAA value was below the threshold (IAA = 1.12). Conclusion: The most active against MDR P. aeruginosa are antiseptics DCM 0.1%, PHMB 0.1%, OCT 0.1%, PVP-I 10%. The effectiveness of MRM 0.01% was found insufficient since IAA was below the threshold (<4).","Nazarchuk H., Denysko T., Chornopyshchuk R.",10.1186/s13756-023-01276-2,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Febuxostat Therapy In Outpatients With Suspected Covid-19: A Clinical Trial,"Background: The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of febuxostat (FBX) in comparison with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and chest CT findings in outpatients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Methods: We conducted a clinical trial involving adult outpatients with the moderate respiratory illness following COVID-19 infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either FBX or HCQ for 5 days. The measured variables were needs to hospitalisation, clinical and laboratory data including fever, cough, breathing rate, C-Reactive Protein level, lymphocytes count at onset of admission and was well as at 5 days of treatments. In addition, CT findings were evaluated on admission and 14 days after initiation of treatment. Results: Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study with a 1 to 1 ratio in FBX and HCQ groups. On admission, fever (66.7%), cough (87%), tachypnoea (44.4%), dyspnoea (35%), elevated CRP value (94.4%) and lung involvement according to chest CT (100%) were documented in enrolled patients with insignificant difference between FBX and HCQ groups. Fever, cough and tachypnoea were significantly mitigated in both groups after five days of treatments without any significant differences between groups. The mean percentages of lung involvement were significantly reduced to 7.3% and 8% after 14 days of treatment with FBX and HCQ, respectively. In adult outpatients with moderate COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness of FBX and HCQ was not different in terms of resolution of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and lung CT findings. Conclusion: This trial suggests that FBX is as an alternative treatment to HCQ for COVID-19 infection and may be considered in patients with a contraindication or precaution to HCQ.","Davoodi L., Abedi S.M., Salehifar E., Alizadeh-Navaei R., Rouhanizadeh H., Khorasani G., Hosseinimehr S.J.",10.1111/ijcp.13600,International Journal Of Clinical Practice
The Role Of Lncrnas In The Tumor Microenvironment And Immunotherapy Of Melanoma,"Melanoma is one of the most lethal tumors with highly aggressive and metastatic properties. Although immunotherapy and targeted therapy have certain therapeutic effects in melanoma, a significant proportion of patients still have drug resistance after treatment. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely recognized as regulatory factors in cancer. They can regulate numerous cellular processes, including cell proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and the immune microenvironment. The role of lncRNAs in malignant tumors has received much attention, whereas the relationship between lncRNAs and melanoma requires further investigation. Our review summarizes tumor suppressive and oncogenic lncRNAs closely related to the occurrence and development of melanoma. We summarize the role of lncRNAs in the immune microenvironment, immunotherapy and targeted therapy to provide new targets and therapeutic methods for clinical treatment.","Zhou W., Xu X., Cen Y., Chen J.",10.3389/fimmu.2022.1085766,Frontiers In Immunology
Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition In Cancer: Complexity And Opportunities,"The cell-biological program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in both development and cancer progression. Depending on the contextual signals and intracellular gene circuits of a particular cell, this program can drive fully epithelial cells to enter into a series of phenotypic states arrayed along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic axis. These cell states display distinctive cellular characteristics, including stemness, invasiveness, drug-resistance and the ability to form metastases at distant organs, and thereby contribute to cancer metastasis and relapse. Currently we still lack a coherent overview of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms inducing cells to enter various states along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic spectrum. An improved understanding of the dynamic and plastic nature of the EMT program has the potential to yield novel therapies targeting this cellular program that may aid in the management of high-grade malignancies.","Zhang Y., Weinberg R.A.",10.1007/s11684-018-0656-6,Frontiers Of Medicine
Room-Temperature Synthesis Of Covalent Organic Frameworks Using Gamma-Irradiation In Open-Air Conditions,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have layered stacking structures, extended π-conjugation, and periodic frameworks have become a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications. However, their synthetic pathways frequently need high temperatures, enclosed systems under high pressures, an inert atmosphere, and extended reaction time, which restrict their practicality in real-world applications. Herein, the use of gamma irradiation is presented to synthesize highly crystalline COFs at room temperature under an open-air condition within a short time. This is demonstrated that there is no significant difference in crystallinity of COFs by gamma irradiation under air, N2 or Ar atmosphere conditions. Moreover, this approach can successfully fabricate COFs in the vessel with different degrees of transparency or even in a plastic container. Importantly, this strategy is applicable not only to imine linkage of COFs but also effective to the imide linkages of COFs. Most importantly, these COFs demonstrate improved crystallinity, surface area, and thermal stability in comparison to the corresponding materials synthesized via the solvothermal method. Finally, a COF synthesized through gamma irradiation exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity in promoting the sacrificial hydrogen evolution from water, displaying a more catalytic efficiency compared with that of its solvothermal analogue.","Elewa A.M., Mekhemer I.M.A., El-Mahdy A.F.M., Sabbah A., Chen S.-Y., Ting L.-Y., Abdelnaser S., Chou H.-H.",10.1002/smll.202311472,"Small (Weinheim An Der Bergstrasse, Germany)"
Detecting Echinocandin Resistance In C. Glabrata Using Commercial Methods: Are Clsi Or Eucast Breakpoints Suitable For Categorical Classification?,"Background: Previous studies correlated Sensititre YeastOne and gradient diffusion plastic strips with standard procedures for the detection of echinocandin-resistant C. glabrata isolates. However, these studies were limited by the low number of resistant isolates studied; the inclusion of sufficient numbers of mutant isolates is essential to test the procedures' capacity to detect resistance. Objective: We assessed the performance of Sensititre YeastOne and Etest strips to detect echinocandin resistance in susceptible or resistant C. glabrata isolates (n = 80) in which the FKS genes were sequenced, and MICs interpreted using EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints. Patients/Methods: Isolates were echinocandin-susceptible (n = 50) or echinocandin-resistant according to EUCAST 7.4 methodology. Echinocandin susceptibility using Sensititre YeastOne and Etest strips and categorical agreement were assessed. Results: All except one anidulafungin-resistant isolate had an anidulafungin Sensititre YeastOne MIC ≥ 0.25 mg/L, while most micafungin-resistant isolates had a MIC ≥ 0.25 mg/L. Likewise, all anidulafungin-resistant isolates had an anidulafungin Etest strip-obtained MIC ≥ 0.03 mg/L, whereas micafungin-resistant isolates were ≥ 0.125 mg/L. Overall, these commercial methods correctly classified > 90% of isolates by using any breakpoint. Despite the low number of errors detected, these were mostly false resistance (major errors) with EUCAST breakpoints and false susceptibility (very major errors) with CLSI breakpoints. Conclusions: Sensititre YeastOne and Etest strips were suitable procedures to detect echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata. The high number of FKS mutants included reinforces our study and opens the door for multicentre validations.","Escribano P., Cuéllar L.A., Álvarez-Gutiérrez A., Muñoz P., Guinea J.",10.1111/myc.70003,Mycoses
In Vitro And In Vivo Antimicrobial Activity Of Antibiotic-Conjugated Carriers With Rapid Ph-Responsive Release Kinetics,"Two representative antibiotics, cephradine (CP) and moxifloxacin (MX), are covalently conjugated with a β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-based carrier via pH-responsive 1-methyl-2-(2′-carboxyethyl) maleic acid amide (MCM) linkers with excellent conjugation efficiency via simple mixing. At pH 5.5, 90% and 80% of the CP and MX, respectively, are released from the carriers within 30 min, in contrast with the much-delayed release profile at pH 7.4. The in vitro inhibitory effect of β-CD–MCM–CP on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus is significantly lower than that of free CP at pH 7.4, but it reaches the level of free CP at pH 5.5. Moreover, S. aureus develops significant CP resistance after pretreatment with free CP, whereas the initial CP sensitivity is maintained after pretreatment with β-CD–MCM–CP at pH 7.4. However, β-CD–MCM–MX exhibits no such pH-responsive activity against Bacteroides fragilis, probably due to the insufficient stability of the MX conjugation at pH 7.4. In nondiabetic and diabetic mouse models, β-CD–MCM–CP significantly reduces the subcutaneous abscess scores and the bacterial counts in the abscess, although this represents only a marginal improvement in antimicrobial activity compared to free CP.","Kang S., Park G.H., Kim S., Kim J., Choi Y., Huang Y., Lee Y., Choi T.H.",10.1002/adhm.201900247,Advanced Healthcare Materials
A Wearable And Stretchable Dual-Wavelength Led Device For Home Care Of Chronic Infected Wounds,"Phototherapy can offer a safe and non-invasive solution against infections, while promoting wound healing. Conventional phototherapeutic devices are bulky and limited to hospital use. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wearable, flexible red and blue LED (r&bLED) patch controlled by a mobile-connected system, enabling safe self-application at home. The patch exhibits excellent skin compatibility, flexibility, and comfort, with high safety under system supervision. Additionally, we synthesized a sprayable fibrin gel (F-gel) containing blue light-sensitive thymoquinone and red light-synergistic NADH. Combined with bLED, thymoquinone eradicated microbes and biofilms within minutes, regardless of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, NADH and rLED synergistically improved macrophage and endothelial cell mitochondrial function, promoting wound healing, reducing inflammation, and enhancing angiogenesis, as validated in infected diabetic wounds in mice and minipigs. This innovative technology holds great promise for revolutionizing at-home phototherapy for chronic infected wounds.","Li M., Wang C., Yu Q., Chen H., Ma Y., Wei L., Wu M.X., Yao M., Lu M.",10.1038/s41467-024-53579-6,Nature Communications
Toll-Like Receptor 4 Agonistic Antibody Promotes Host Defense Against Chronic Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Lung Infection In Mice,"Chronic lower respiratory tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is difficult to treat due to enhanced antibiotic resistance and decreased efficacy of drug delivery to destroyed lung tissue. To determine the potential for restorative immunomodulation therapies, we evaluated the effect of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation on the host immune response to Pseudomonas infection in mice. We implanted sterile plastic tubes precoated with P. aeruginosa in the bronchi of mice, administered the TLR4/ MD2 agonistic monoclonal antibody UT12 intraperitoneally every week, and subsequently analyzed the numbers of viable bacteria and inflammatory cells and the levels of cytokines. We also performed flow cytometry-based phagocytosis and opsonophagocytic killing assays in vitro using UT12-treated murine peritoneal neutrophils. UT12-treated mice showed significantly enhanced bacterial clearance, increased numbers of Ly6G(+) neutrophils, and increased concentrations of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) in the lungs (P<0.05). Depletion of CD4(+) T cells eliminated the ability of the UT12 treatment to improve bacterial clearance and promote neutrophil recruitment and MIP-2 production. Additionally, UT12-pretreated peritoneal neutrophils exhibited increased opsonophagocytic killing activity via activation of the serine protease pathway, specifically neutrophil elastase activity, in a TLR4-dependent manner. These data indicated that UT12 administration significantly augmented the innate immune response against chronic bacterial infection, in part by promoting neutrophil recruitment and bactericidal function.","Nakamura S., Iwanaga N., Seki M., Fukudome K., Oshima K., Miyazaki T., Izumikawa K., Yanagihara K., Miyazaki Y., Mukae H., Kohno S.",10.1128/IAI.01384-15,Infection And Immunity
Is Routine Antibiotic Prophylaxis Warranted In Dental Implant Surgery To Prevent Early Implant Failure? - A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: The question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered routinely for dental implant surgery is unresolved. Despite the lack of conclusive supportive evidence, antibiotics are often administered to reduce the risk of infection, which could lead to early implant failure. Increasing antibiotic resistance is a major concern and it is therefore important to reduce the overall use of antibiotics, including in dentistry. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative antibiotics in preventing early implant failure, in overall healthy patients undergoing dental implant surgery. METHODS: An electronic search was undertaken of PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to October 1st, 2023, to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs). All RCTs comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with no antibiotics/placebo in overall healthy patients receiving dental implants were included. The primary outcome was patients with early implant failure. Risk of bias was assessed, data were extracted, a meta-analysis was done, and GRADE certainty-of-evidence ratings were determined. The risk ratio (RR), the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 1086 abstracts were screened, and 17 articles were reviewed in full text. Seven RCTs with moderate or low risk of bias and with a total of 1859 patients and 3014 implants were included in the meta-analysis. With reference to early implant failure at patient level, the meta-analysis failed to disclose any statistically significant difference (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.30-1.47) between antibiotic prophylaxis and a placebo. The risk difference was -0.007 (95% CI: -0.035-0.020) leading to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 143. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental implant surgery does not seem to have any substantial effect on early implant failure ( ). The results do not support routine antibiotic prophylaxis for dental implant surgery.","Momand P., Naimi-Akbar A., Hultin M., Lund B., Götrick B.",10.1186/s12903-024-04611-0,Bmc Oral Health
Diclofenac Sodium Effectively Inhibits The Biofilm Formation Of Staphylococcus Epidermidis,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen commonly implicated in medical device-related infections. Its propensity to form biofilms not only leads to chronic infections but also exacerbates the issue of antibiotic resistance, necessitating high-dose antimicrobial treatments. In this study, we explored the use of diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, as an anti-biofilm agent against S. epidermidis. In this study, crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscope analysis showed that diclofenac sodium, at subinhibitory concentration (0.4 mM), significantly inhibited biofilm formation in both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis isolates. MTT assays demonstrated that 0.4 mM diclofenac sodium reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms by 25.21–49.01% compared to untreated controls. Additionally, the treatment of diclofenac sodium resulted in a significant decrease (56.01–65.67%) in initial bacterial adhesion, a crucial early phase of biofilm development. Notably, diclofenac sodium decreased the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), a key component of the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix, in a dose-dependent manner. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that diclofenac sodium treatment downregulated biofilm-associated genes icaA, fnbA, and sigB and upregulated negative regulatory genes icaR and luxS, providing potential mechanistic insights. These findings indicate that diclofenac sodium inhibits S. epidermidis biofilm formation by affecting initial bacterial adhesion and the PIA synthesis. This underscores the potential of diclofenac sodium as a supplementary antimicrobial agent in combating staphylococcal biofilm-associated infections.","Xi H., Luo Z., Liu M.-F., Chen Q., Zhu Q., Yuan L., Sheng Y.-Y., Zhao R.",10.1007/s00203-024-04020-5,Archives Of Microbiology
Immunomodulatory Functions Of Adipose Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cell Derived From Donors With Type 2 Diabetes And Obesity On Cd4 T Cells,"For adipose stromal/stem cell (ASCs)-based immunomodulatory therapies, it is important to study how donor characteristics, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), influence ASCs efficacy. Here, ASCs were obtained from 2 groups, donors with T2D and obesity (dASCs) or nondiabetic donors with normal-weight (ndASCs), and then cultured with anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated allogeneic CD4 T cells. ASCs were studied for the expression of the immunomodulators CD54, CD274, and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO) in inflammatory conditions. CD4 T cells cultured alone or in cocultures were assessed to evaluate proliferation, activation marker surface expression, apoptosis, the regulatory T cells (Tregs; CD4+ CD25high FOXP3+) frequency, and intracellular cytokine expression using flow cytometry. Modulation of T-cell subset cytokines was explored via ELISA. In inflammatory conditions, the expression of CD54, CD274, and IDO was significantly upregulated in ASCs, with no significant differences between ndASCs and dASCs. dASCs retained the potential to significantly suppress CD4 T-cell proliferation, with a slightly weaker inhibitory effect than ndASCs, which was associated with significantly reduced abilities to decrease IL-2 production and increase IL-8 levels in cocultures. Such attenuated potentials were significantly correlated with increasing body mass index. dASCs and ndASCs comparably reduced CD4 T-cell viability, HLA-DR expression, and interferon-gamma production and conversely increased CD69 expression, the Tregs percentage, and IL-17A production. Considerable amounts of the immunomodulators prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-6 were detected in the conditioned medium of cocultures. These findings suggest that ASCs obtained from donors with T2D and obesity are receptive to the inflammatory environment and able to modulate CD4 T cells accordingly.","Mahmoud M., Juntunen M., Adnan A., Kummola L., Junttila I.S., Kelloniemi M., Tyrväinen T., Huhtala H., Abd El Fattah A.I., Amr K., El Erian A.M., Patrikoski M., Miettinen S.",10.1093/stmcls/sxad021,Stem Cells
Secretory Proteins In The Orchestration Of Microbial Virulence: The Curious Case Of Staphylococcus Aureus,"Microbial virulence showcases an excellent model for adaptive changes that enable an organism to survive and proliferate in a hostile environment and exploit host resources to its own benefit. In Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen of the human host, known for the diversity of the disease conditions it inflicts and the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance, virulence is a consequence of having a highly plastic genome that is amenable to quick reprogramming and the ability to express a diverse arsenal of virulence factors. Virulence factors that are secreted to the host milieu effectively manipulate the host conditions to favor bacterial survival and growth. They assist in colonization, nutrient acquisition, immune evasion, and systemic spread. The structural and functional characteristics of the secreted virulence proteins have been shaped to assist S. aureus in thriving and disseminating effectively within the host environment and exploiting the host resources to its best benefit. With the aim of highlighting the importance of secreted virulence proteins in bacterial virulence, the present chapter provides a comprehensive account of the role of the major secreted proteins of S. aureus in orchestrating its virulence in the human host.","Francis D., Bhairaddy A., Joy A., Hari G.V., Francis A.",10.1016/bs.apcsb.2022.10.004,Advances In Protein Chemistry And Structural Biology
Tumor-Derived Exosomal Non-Coding Rnas: The Emerging Mechanisms And Potential Clinical Applications In Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignancy and is ranking the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. At present, BC is still an intricate challenge confronted with high invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence rate. Exosomes are membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles with the lipid bilayer and recently have been confirmed as significant mediators of tumor cells to communicate with surrounding cells in the tumor microenvironment. As very important orchestrators, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are aberrantly expressed and participate in regulating gene expression in multiple human cancers, while the most reported ncRNAs within exosomes in BC are microRNAs (miRNAs), long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). Notably, ncRNAs containing exosomes are novel frontiers to shape malignant behaviors in recipient BC cells such as angiogenesis, immunoregulation, proliferation, and migration. It means that tumor-derived ncRNAs-containing exosomes are pluripotent carriers with intriguing and elaborate roles in BC progression via complex mechanisms. The ncRNAs in exosomes are usually excavated based on specific de-regulated expression verified by RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, and PCR experiments. Here, this article will elucidate the recent existing research on the functions and mechanisms of tumor-derived exosomal miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA in BC, especially in BC cell proliferation, metastasis, immunoregulation, and drug resistance. Moreover, these tumor-derived exosomal ncRNAs that existed in blood samples are proved to be excellent diagnostic biomarkers for improving diagnosis and prognosis. The in-depth understanding of tumor-derived exosomal ncRNAs in BC will provide further insights for elucidating the BC oncogenesis and progress and exploring novel therapeutic strategies for combating BC.","Yi Y., Wu M., Zeng H., Hu W., Zhao C., Xiong M., Lv W., Deng P., Zhang Q., Wu Y.",10.3389/fonc.2021.738945,Frontiers In Oncology
Microrna-16 Sensitizes Drug-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells To Adriamycin By Targeting Wip1 And Bcl-2,"Clinical evidence indicates that drug resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of breast cancer (BC). Drug resistance results in the disease being uncontrollable, and leads to high mortality rates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemosensitizing effect of microRNA (miR)-16 on Adriamycin (ADM)-resistant BC cells and the associated mechanisms. BC tumors from 40 patients were collected and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of miR-16. ADM-sensitive (MCF-7/S) and -resistant (MCF-7/A) BC cell lines were used to determine the expression of miR-16 prior to and following transfection with miR-16 mimics or inhibitor. The effects of increased and decreased miR-16 expression on the chemosensitivity of BC cells to ADM was analyzed using MTT, colony survival and flow cytometry assays. miR-16 was found to regulate wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) and Bcl-2 expression, as confirmed by western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and luciferase reporter assays. miR-16 expression in drug-resistant tumor tissues and cells was decreased, compared with that the drug-sensitive equivalents. Overexpression of miR-16 in MCF-7/A was associated with a sharp downregulation of Wip1 and Bcl-2 expression, leading to increased ADM-induced cell apoptosis and sensitization of MCF-7/A cells to ADM treatment. Taken together, the results demonstrate that miR-16 may serve as an effective chemosensitizing target to enhance the effects of chemotherapy in drug-resistant BC cells with high Wip1 and Bcl-2 expression. This provides a novel approach to improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy in drug-resistant BC via regulation of miRs.","Gao X., Wang M., Zhang Y., Xu Z., Ding J., Tang J.",10.3892/ol.2019.10637,Oncology Letters
Cd147 Confers Temozolomide Resistance Of Glioma Cells Via The Regulation Of Β-Trcp/Nrf2 Pathway,"Background: Drug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in cancer therapy. temozolomide (TMZ) represents the most important chemotherapeutic option for glioma treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ remains very limited due to its frequent resistance in glioma, and the underlying mechanisms were not fully addressed. Herein, we demonstrate that the elevated expression of CD147 contributes to TMZ resistance in glioma cells, potentially through the post-translational regulation of Nrf2 expression. Methods: Cell-based assays of CD147 triggered drug resistance were performed through Edu-incorporation assay, CCK8 assay, TUNEL staining assay and flow cytometric assay. Luciferase reporter assay, protein stability related assays, co-immunoprecipitation assay were used to determine CD147 induction of Nrf2 expression through β-TrCP dependent ubiquitin system. Finally, the effect of the CD147/Nrf2 signaling on glioma progression and TMZ resistance were evaluated by functional experiments and clinical samples. Results: Based on the analysis of clinical glioma tissues, CD147 is highly expressed in glioma tissues and positively associated with tumor malignancy. Suppression of CD147 expression increased the inhibitory effect of TMZ on cell survival in both U251 and T98G cells, whereas the gain of CD147 function blocked TMZ-induced ROS production and cell death. Mechanistic study indicates that CD147 inhibited GSK3β/β-TrCP-dependent Nrf2 degradation by promoting Akt activation, and subsequently increased Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidant gene expressions. Supporting the biological significance, the reciprocal relationship between CD147 and Nrf2 was observed in glioma tissues, and associated with patient outcome. Conclusions: Our data provide the first evidence that glioma resistance to TMZ is potentially due to the activation of CD147/Nrf2 axis. CD147 promotes Nrf2 stability through the suppression of GSK3β/β-TrCP dependent Nrf2 protein degradation, which results in the ablation of TMZ induced ROS production. As such, we point out that targeting CD147/Nrf2 axis may provide a new strategy for the treatment of TMZ resistant gliomas.","Bu X., Qu X., Guo K., Meng X., Yang X., Huang Q., Dou W., Feng L., Wei X., Gao J., Sun W., Chao M., Han L., Hu Y., Shen L., Zhang J., Wang L.",10.7150/ijbs.60894,International Journal Of Biological Sciences

Ascl1 Is Activated Downstream Of The Ror2/Creb Signaling Pathway To Support Lineage Plasticity In Prostate Cancer,"Lineage plasticity is a form of therapy-induced drug resistance. In prostate cancer, androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors potentially lead to the accretion of tumor relapse with loss of AR signaling and a shift from a luminal state to an alternate program. However, the molecular and signaling mechanisms orchestrating the development of lineage plasticity under the pressure of AR-targeted therapies are not fully understood. Here, a survey of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) identifies ROR2 as the top upregulated RTK following AR pathway inhibition, which feeds into lineage plasticity by promoting stem-cell-like and neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ROR2 activates the ERK/CREB signaling pathway to modulate the expression of the lineage commitment transcription factor ASCL1. Collectively, our findings nominate ROR2 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the ENZ-induced plastic phenotype and potentially re-sensitize tumors to AR pathway inhibitors.","Tabrizian N., Nouruzi S., Cui C.J., Kobelev M., Namekawa T., Lodhia I., Talal A., Sivak O., Ganguli D., Zoubeidi A.",10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112937,Cell Reports
"Current Landscape Of Tumor-Derived Exosomal Ncrnas In Glioma Progression, Detection, And Drug Resistance","Glioma is the most common and fatal tumor of the central nervous system in humans. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapeutic agents, glioma still has a poor prognosis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioma is of highly complex heterogeneity, which relies on a network-based communication between glioma cells and other stromal cell types. Exosomes are the most common type of naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, ranging in size from 40 to 160 nm, and can serve as carriers for proteins, RNAs, and other biologically active molecules. Recent evidence has shown that glioma-derived exosomes (GDEs) can be integrally detected in the local tissue and circulatory blood samples, and also can be transferred to recipient cells to mediate transmission of genetic information. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) mainly including microRNA, long non-coding RNA, and circular RNA, account for a large portion of the human transcriptome. A broad range of ncRNAs encapsulated in GDEs is reported to exert regulatory functions in various pathophysiological processes of glioma. Herein, this review summarizes the latest findings on the fundamental roles of GDE ncRNAs that have been implicated in glioma behaviors, immunological regulation, diagnosis potential, and treatment resistance, as well as the current limitations and perspectives. Undoubtedly, a thorough understanding of this area will provide comprehensive insights into GDE-based clinical applications for combating gliomas.","He X., Qi Y., Zhang X., Liu X., Li X., Li S., Wu Y., Zhang Q.",10.1038/s41419-021-04430-z,Cell Death And Disease
Circular Rnas: Their Role In The Pathogenesis And Orchestration Of Breast Cancer,"As one of the most frequently occurring malignancies in women, breast cancer (BC) is still an enormous threat to women all over the world. The high mortality rates in BC patients are associated with BC recurrence, metastatic progression to distant organs, and therapeutic resistance. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), belonging to the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are connected end to end to form covalently closed single-chain circular molecules. CircRNAs are widely found in different species and a variety of human cells, with the features of diversity, evolutionary conservation, stability, and specificity. CircRNAs are emerging important participators in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and cancer. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs are involved in BC progress by regulating gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level via binding to miRNAs then inhibiting their function, suggesting that circRNAs may be potential targets for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BC. Herein, in this article, we have reviewed and summarized the current studies about the biogenesis, features, and functions of circRNAs. More importantly, we emphatically elucidate the pivotal functions and mechanisms of circRNAs in BC growth, metastasis, diagnosis, and drug resistance. Deciphering the complex networks, especially the circRNA-miRNA target gene axis, will endow huge potentials in developing therapeutic strategies for combating BC.","He X., Xu T., Hu W., Tan Y., Wang D., Wang Y., Zhao C., Yi Y., Xiong M., Lv W., Wu M., Li X., Wu Y., Zhang Q.",10.3389/fcell.2021.647736,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Molecular Toxicity Of Benzo(A)Pyrene Mediated By Elicited Oxidative Stress Infer Skeletal Deformities And Apoptosis In Embryonic Zebrafish,"Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has become an integral component of disposed of plastic waste, organic pollutants, and remnants of combustible materials in the aquatic environment due to their persistent nature. The accumulation and integration of these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have raised concern to human health and ecological safety. This study assessed the BaP-induced in vivo molecular toxicity with embryonic zebrafish inferred by oxidative stress and apoptosis. BaP was found to induce morphological and physiological abnormalities like delayed hatching (p < 0.05). Computational analysis demonstrated the high-affinity interaction of BaP with the zebrafish hatching enzyme (ZHE1) with Arg, Cys, Ala, Tyr, and Phe located at the active site revealing the influence of BaP on delayed hatching due to alteration of the enzyme structure. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant down-regulation of the skeletal genes Sox9a, SPP1/OPN, and Col1a1 (p < 0.05) genes. The cellular investigations unraveled that the toxicity of BaP extends to the skeletal regions of zebrafish (head, backbone, and tail) because of the elicited oxidative stress leading to apoptosis. The study extended the horizon of understanding of BaP toxicity at the molecular level which will enhance the indulgent and designing of techniques for better ecological sustainability.","Elfawy H.A., Anupriya S., Mohanty S., Patel P., Ghosal S., Panda P.K., Das B., Verma S.K., Patnaik S.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147989,Science Of The Total Environment
Metasurface Reflector (Msr) Loading For High Performance Small Microstrip Antenna Design,"A meander stripline feed multiband microstrip antenna loaded with metasurface reflector (MSR) structure has been designed, analyzed and constructed that offers the wireless communication services for UHF/microwave RFID and WLAN/WiMAX applications. The proposed MSR assimilated antenna comprises planar straight forward design of circular shaped radiator with horizontal slots on it and 2D metasurface formed by the periodic square metallic element that resembles the behavior of metamaterials. A custom made high dielectric bio-plastic substrate (år = 15) is used for fabricating the prototype of the MSR embedded planar monopole antenna. The details of the design progress through numerical simulations and experimental results are presented and discussed accordingly. The measured impedance bandwidth, radiation patterns and gain of the proposed MSR integrated antenna are compared with the obtained results from numerical simulation, and a good compliance can be observed between them. The investigation shows that utilization of MSR structure has significantly broadened the -10dB impedance bandwidth than the conventional patch antenna: from 540 to 632 MHz (17%), 467 to 606 MHz (29%) and 758 MHz to 1062 MHz (40%) for three distinct operating bands centered at 0.9, 3.5 and 5.5 GHz. Additionally, due to the assimilation of MSR, the overall realized gains have been upgraded to a higher value of 3.62 dBi, 6.09 dBi and 8.6 dBi for lower, middle and upper frequency band respectively. The measured radiation patterns, impedance bandwidths (S11<-10 dB) and gains from the MSR loaded antenna prototype exhibit reasonable characteristics that can satisfy the requirements of UHF/microwave (5.8 GHz) RFID, WiMAX (3.5/5.5 GHz) and WLAN (5.2/5.8 GHz) applications.","Ahsan M.R., Islam M.T., Ullah M.H., Singh M.J., Ali M.T.",10.1371/journal.pone.0127185,Plos One
Microglia In Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is one of most common chronic neurological disorders, and the antiseizure medications developed by targeting neurocentric mechanisms have not effectively reduced the proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Further exploration of the cellular or molecular mechanism of epilepsy is expected to provide new options for treatment. Recently, more and more researches focus on brain network components other than neurons, among which microglia have attracted much attention for their diverse biological functions. As the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia have highly plastic transcription, morphology and functional characteristics, which can change dynamically in a context-dependent manner during the progression of epilepsy. In the pathogenesis of epilepsy, highly reactive microglia interact with other components in the epileptogenic network by performing crucial functions such as secretion of soluble factors and phagocytosis, thus continuously reshaping the landscape of the epileptic brain microenvironment. Indeed, microglia appear to be both pro-epileptic and anti-epileptic under the different spatiotemporal contexts of disease, rendering interventions targeting microglia biologically complex and challenging. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the pathophysiological role of microglia in epileptic brain homeostasis alterations and explores potential therapeutic or modulatory targets for epilepsy targeting microglia.","Yu C., Deng X.-J., Xu D.",10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106249,Neurobiology Of Disease
Incidence Of Risk Factors For Bloodstream Infections In Patients With Major Burns Receiving Intensive Care: A Retrospective Single-Center Cohort Study,"Objectives: The objective was primarily to identify risk factors for bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by different pathogens. Methods: A retrospective single-center cohort study was performed on 472 burn patients with an abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) ≥ 3, a total burn surface area (TBSA) ≥ 10%, and an ICU stay of at least 24 h. Risk factors for different BSI pathogens were analyzed by competing risks regression model of Fine and Gray. Results: A total of 114 burn patients developed 171 episodes of BSIs caused by gram-negative bacteria (n = 78;46%), gram-positive bacteria (n = 69;40%), and fungi (n = 24;14%) median after 14 days (range, 1–164), 16 days (range, 1–170), and 16 days (range, 0–89), respectively.

(n = 22 for both) was significantly associated with increased TBSA (p ≤ 0.006) and ABSI (p < 0.0001) and need for fasciotomy (p < 0.01). The death risk of patients with MDR gram-negative bacteremia was significantly increased by a hazard ratio of 12.6 (95% CI:4.8–32.8; p < 0.0001).

Inhibition Of Integrin Alpha V/Beta 5 Mitigates The Protective Effect Induced By Irisin In Hemorrhage,"Introduction: Irisin plays an important role in regulating tissue stress, cardiac function, and inflammation. Integrin αvβ5 was recently identified as a receptor for irisin to elicit its physiologic function. It remains unknown whether integrin αvβ5 is required for irisin's function in modulating the physiologic response to hemorrhage. The objective of this study is to examine if integrin αvβ5 contributes to the effects of irisin during the hemorrhagic response. Methods: Hemorrhage was induced in mice by achieving a mean arterial blood pressure of 35–45 mmHg for one hour, followed by two hours of resuscitation. Irisin (0.5 μg/kg) was administrated to assess its pharmacologic effects in hemorrhage. Cilengitide, a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide (cRGDyK) which is an inhibitor of integrin αvβ5, or control RGDS (1 mg/kg) was administered with irisin. In another cohort of mice, the irisin-induced protective effect was examined after knocking down integrin β5 with nanoparticle delivery of integrin β5 sgRNA using CRSIPR/Cas-9 gene editing. Cardiac function and hemodynamics were measured using echocardiography and femoral artery catheterization, respectively. Systemic cytokine releases were measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Histological analyses were used to determine tissue damage in myocardium, skeletal muscles, and lung tissues. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was carried out to assess apoptosis in tissues. Results: Hemorrhage induced reduction of integrin αvβ5 in skeletal muscles and repressed recovery of cardiac performance and hemodynamics. Irisin treatment led to significantly improved cardiac function, which was abrogated by treatment with Cilengitide or knockdown of integrin β5. Furthermore, irisin resulted in a marked suppression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), muscle edema, and inflammatory cells infiltration in myocardium and skeletal muscles, which was attenuated by Cilengitide or knockdown of integrin β5. Irisin-induced reduction of apoptosis in the myocardium, skeletal muscles, and lung, which were attenuated by either the inhibition of integrin αvβ5, or knockdown of integrin β5. Conclusion: Integrin αvβ5 plays an important role for irisin in modulating the protective effect during hemorrhage.","Wang L., Kulthinee S., Slate-Romano J., Zhao T., Shanmugam H., Dubielecka P.M., Zhang L.X., Qin G., Zhuang S., Chin Y.E., Zhao T.C.",10.1016/j.yexmp.2023.104869,Experimental And Molecular Pathology
A Bibliometric And Visual Analysis Of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts,"Background: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the predominant stromal component within the tumour microenvironment (TME), exhibiting considerable heterogeneity and plasticity that significantly impact immune response and metabolic reprogramming within the TME, thereby influencing tumour progression. Consequently, investigating CAFs is of utmost importance.

The First Observation Of The Formation Of Persistent Aminoxyl Radicals And Reactive Nitrogen Species On Photoirradiated Nitrogen-Containing Microplastics,"Nitrogen-containing microplastics (N-MPs) are widely present in the atmosphere, but their potential health risks have been overlooked. In this study, the formation of persistent aminoxyl radicals (PAORs) and reactive nitrogen species (RNSs) on the N-MPs under light irradiation was investigated. After photoaging, an anisotropic triplet with the g-factor of ∼2.0044, corresponding to PAORs, was detected on the nonaromatic polyamide (PA) rather than amino resin (AmR) by electron paramagnetic resonance and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The generated amine oxide portions on the photoaged PA were identified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, which were considered to be the main structural basis/precursors of a PAOR. Surprisingly, RNSs were also observed on the irradiated PA. The generated ·NO due to the aphotolysis of nitrone groups simultaneously reacted with peroxide radicals and O(2)·(–) to yield ·NO(2) and peroxynitrite, respectively, which were responsible for peroxyacyl nitrates (PAN) and CO(3)·(–) formation. Besides, a significantly higher oxidative potential and reductive potential were observed for the aged PA than AmR, which is assigned to the abundant RNSs, organic hydroperoxides and PANs, and a strong ability to transfer electrons from PAOR, respectively. This work provides important information for the potential risks of airborne N-MPs and may serve as a guide for future toxicological assessments.","Zhu K., Jia H., Jiang W., Sun Y., Zhang C., Liu Z., Wang T., Guo X., Zhu L.",10.1021/acs.est.1c05650,Environmental Science And Technology
Miniaturized Real-Time Pcr On A Q3 System For Rapid Kras Genotyping,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an aggressive human malignancy with a complex genomic landscape harboring KRAS mutations. In 40%-60% of patients with CRC, constantly active KRAS proteins affect the prognosis, surgical strategy, and clinical benefit from therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents. For this reason, there is a greater demand for minimally-invasive diagnostic devices to characterize the genetic pattern and prevent the acquired mechanism to drug resistance. The rapid developments in cutting-edge diagnostic techniques are expected to play a growing role in medicine and represent an attractive promise to identify potential responders to personalized medicine. Here we propose a new method to simultaneously detect the main KRAS mutations on the portable real-time PCR Q3 platform. This platform is based on hybrid silicon-plastic technology implemented in a miniaturized chip able to achieve a sample-in answer-out rapid analysis, allowing a new approach to genetic counseling and testing.","Guarnaccia M., Iemmolo R., Petralia S., Conoci S., Cavallaro S.",10.3390/s17040831,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Overcoming Chemoresistance In Cancer Stem Cells With The Help Of Micrornas In Colorectal Cancer,"It has been recognized that acute resistance to chemotherapy mediated by post-transcriptional and translational control is crucial to influence response and survival in cancer treatment. Tumor cells are highly heterogeneous and have the ability to adapt a resistance phenotype through epigenetic regulations such as microRNAs. This poses a major challenge to the treatment of advanced stage colon cancer patients. Colon cancer stem cells have been identified as one of the major contributors to resistance of colon cancer to chemotherapy. Through various mechanisms, these cells are able to resist the effects of traditional chemotherapeutics. The challenge posed by these cells is further enhanced by their plastic nature, where cells can transition between non-stem cancer cells and cancer stem cells creating a moving target. In this editorial, we discuss some of the recent advancements in overcoming chemoresistance associated with colon cancer stem cells with the help of microRNAs.","Fesler A., Guo S., Liu H., Wu N., Ju J.",10.2217/epi-2017-0041,Epigenomics
Preventive And Therapeutic Effects Of Chinese Herbal Compounds Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Traditional Chinese Medicines, unique biomedical and pharmaceutical resources, have been widely used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevention and treatment. Accumulated Chinese herb-derived compounds with significant anti-cancer effects against HCC have been identified. Chinese herbal compounds are effective in preventing carcinogenesis, inhibiting cell proliferation, arresting cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, autophagy, cell senescence and anoikis, inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis and angiogenesis, regulating immune function, reversing drug resistance and enhancing the effects of chemotherapy in HCC. This paper comprehensively reviews these compounds and their effects on HCC.

Uncovering The Mechanisms Of Acinetobacter Baumannii Virulence,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that causes ventilator-associated as well as bloodstream infections in critically ill patients, and the spread of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter strains is cause for concern. Much of the success of A. baumannii can be directly attributed to its plastic genome, which rapidly mutates when faced with adversity and stress. However, fundamental virulence mechanisms beyond canonical drug resistance were recently uncovered that enable A. baumannii and, to a limited extent, other medically relevant Acinetobacter species to successfully thrive in the health-care environment. In this Review, we explore the molecular features that promote environmental persistence, including desiccation resistance, biofilm formation and motility, and we discuss the most recently identified virulence factors, such as secretion systems, surface glycoconjugates and micronutrient acquisition systems that collectively enable these pathogens to successfully infect their hosts.","Harding C.M., Hennon S.W., Feldman M.F.",10.1038/nrmicro.2017.148,Nature Reviews Microbiology
Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics For Breast Expander/Implant Infection: Treatment-Related Adverse Events And Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Despite best practices, infection remains the most common complication after breast reconstruction with expanders and implants, ranging from 2% to 29%. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently used in nonsurgical treatment of implant-associated infections in an effort to salvage the reconstruction. Pitfalls of antibiotherapy include adverse events, vascular access site complications, and drug resistance. Our goals were to describe management of implant infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics, review treatment related adverse events, and report on outcomes of therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out to identify patients who were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for periprosthetic infection. Patient characteristics, surgical details, and antibiotic therapy-related adverse events were collected. Eventual outcome related to expander/implant salvage was noted. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients (111 treatment episodes) were identified. Mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 18 days (range, 1-40 days). The most commonly used parenteral treatment was a combination of daptomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam (65%) or an alternative agent (16%). Fifty-nine percent of treatment episodes resulted in salvage of the expander or implant. Thirty-five percent treatment episodes were associated with 1 or more adverse events: diarrhea (12.6%), rash (10%), vaginal candidiasis (3.6%), agranulocytosis/neutropenic fever (3.6%), nausea (3.6%), urinary complaint (0.9%), myositis (0.9%), headache (0.9%), vascular line occlusion (1.8%), deep vein thrombosis (1.8%), and finger numbness (0.9%). No patients developed Clostridium difficile colitis. Five episodes (4%) needed discontinuation of antibiotics because of severe adverse events. The prosthesis was explanted in 3 of the cases of discontinued treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show favorable outcomes and well-tolerated adverse effects with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotherapy for periprosthetic infection. However, every effort should be made to deescalate therapy by narrowing the spectrum or limiting the duration, to minimize adverse events and development of bacterial resistance. Treating surgeons need to carefully weigh benefits of therapy and be aware of potential complications that might necessitate discontinuation of treatment.","Ozturk C.N., Ozturk C., Sigurdson S.L., Magner W.J., Sheedy B., Lohman R., Moon W.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000002720,Annals Of Plastic Surgery
Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Adipose Tissue And Extracellular Vesicles In Ovarian Cancer Patients: A Bridge Toward Metastatic Diffusion Or A New Therapeutic Opportunity?,"Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies among women. Approximately 75% of the patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease that already has metastasis, particularly to the omentum. The omentum constitutes the ideal soil for ovarian cancer metastasis due to a complex intraperitoneal milieu that favors and supports the whole metastatic process. Adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ADSCs) are part of this microenvironment and foster tumor progression via sustained paracrine secretion, including extracellular vesicles (EVs). Nonetheless, the preferential relationship between ADSCs, ADSC-derived EVs, and ovarian cancer cells could be exploited to use ADSCs and EVs as a vehicle for anti-cancer therapies. This review will analyze the strict relations between tumor progression, metastatic disease, and adipose tissue with its staminal components. In addition, we will describe the crosstalk and biologic relationship between ADSCs and tumor cells, the role of EVs in intercellular communication, the establishment of drug resistance, metastatic capacity, and ovarian cancer progression. We will analyze the new therapeutic opportunities in treating ovarian cancer offered by ADSCs and EVs as a vehicle for therapeutic molecules to target precisely tumor cells and limit the systemic adverse effects. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of these therapeutic approaches.","Storti G., Scioli M.G., Kim B.-S., Terriaca S., Fiorelli E., Orlandi A., Cervelli V.",10.3390/cells10082117,Cells
Cytotoxicity Of Novel Redox Sensitive Peg(2000)-S-S-Ptx Micelles Against Drug-Resistant Ovarian And Breast Cancer Cells,"Purpose: Since the last decade, it is established that nonspecific delivery of chemotherapeutics fails to effectively treat cancer due to systemic cytotoxicity, poor biodistribution at tumor site and most importantly the development of drug resistance (MDR). Stimuli-sensitive drug delivery systems gained significant attention in recent years for effective tumor therapy and reversal of MDR. The aim of this study was developing a redox sensitive micellar prodrug system, by taking the advantage of the significant difference in GSH levels between extracellular and intracellular environments, but more importantly in healthy and tumor tissues. Methods: Redox sensitive PEG(2000)-S-S-PTX micelles were developed for intracellular paclitaxel delivery and characterized in vitro. In vitro release studies were carried out and followed by cytotoxicity studies in chemo-resistant ovarian and breast cancer cells in various reducing environments for different time periods to confirm their potential. Results: PEG(2000)-S-S-PTX, was synthesized and characterized as a redox sensitive micellar prodrug system. The reduction sensitivity and in vitro PTX release properties were confirmed in reducing environments comparatively with physiological conditions. Cytotoxicity studies suggested that ovarian (SK-OV-3) cells could be better candidates for treatment with redox-sensitive drug delivery systems than breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. Conclusions: The results of this study highlights the importance of personalized therapy since no fits-for-all system can be developed for different cancer with significantly different metabolic activities.

Fbp1 Promotes Ovarian Cancer Development Through The Acceleration Of Cell Cycle Transition And Metastasis,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth most common malignancy in women, with a 5-year mortality of >70% in North America. As the symptoms are often not observed until the cancer has spread extensively, few women are diagnosed at an early stage of disease. Large-scale gene expression analyses have identified molecular subtypes within high-grade ovarian cancer with variable survival rates and drug resistance. The understanding of gene expression, the mechanisms underlying cancer processes and drug resistances have facilitated the development of targeted therapies. The far-upstream element (Fuse)-binding protein 1 (FBP1) is overexpressed in a number of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, and has been identified as an oncoprotein. In our early studies, FBP1 was demonstrated to physically interact with p53 and suppresses p53 transcription activity. In the present study, FBP1 expression increased as ovarian cancer developed. Among ovarian normal, adenoma and carcinoma tissues, the highest FBP1 expression was identified in carcinoma tissues. Furthermore FBP1 did not influence the apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells, yet enhanced cell cycle transition and metastasis. Therefore, it was hypothesized that FBP1 promotes ovarian cancer development through the acceleration of cell cycle transition and metastasis, and FBP1 is a novel potential biological marker for epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis.","Xiong X., Zhang J., Hua X., Cao W., Qin S., Dai L., Liu W., Zhang Z., Li X., Liu Z.",10.3892/ol.2018.8872,Oncology Letters
Effect Of Adipocyte-Secreted Factors On Epcam+/Cd133+ Hepatic Stem Cell Population,"Recent epidemiological studies have associated obesity with a variety of cancer types including HCC. However, the tumor initiating role of obesity in hepatocarcinogenesis is still unknown. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of adipocyte-secreted factors on EpCAM+/CD133+ cancer stem cells and to identify which factors play a role in modulating hepatic cancer stem cell behavior. Our results demonstrated that adipocyte-secreted factors affect motility and drug resistance of EpCAM+/CD133+ cells. When incubated with adipocyte conditioned media, EpCAM+/CD133+ cells exhibited augmented motility and reduced sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Using array-based system, we identified secretion of several cytokines such as IL6, IL8 and MCP1 by cultured adipocytes and activation of c-Met, STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in EpCAM+/CD133+ cells incubated with adipocyte conditioned media. Treating EpCAM+/CD133+ cancer stem cells with IL6 receptor blocking antibody or c-Met inhibitor SU11274 both reduced the increase in motility; however SU11274 had greater effect on relieving protection from sorafenib-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that adipocyte-secreted factors might regulate cancer stem cell behavior through several signaling molecules including c-Met, STAT3 and ERK1/2 and inhibition of these signaling pathways offer novel strategies in targeting the effect of adipose-derived cytokines in cancer.","Firtina Karagonlar Z., Koç D., Şahin E., Avci S.T., Yilmaz M., Atabey N., Erdal E.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.137,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
Role Of Microplastics In Microbial Community Structure And Functions In Urban Soils,"Evidence from the laboratory suggests that microplastics (MPs) can harm soil microorganisms, affecting the structures and functions of microbial communities. The impact of soil MPs on microbes in actual urban environments with high human activity levels, however, has not been well reported. To investigate the MP effect on urban soil microorganisms under complex scenarios, we analyzed 42 soil samples from standardized plots of 7 urban functional zones. We report that urban green spaces are important for studying microbial diversity in the study area, and they also contribute to the global homogenization of soil microbes and genes. Bacterial communities in soils enriched with various MPs showed greater differences in OTUs than fungi. Compared to low-MP soils, most ARGs and nutrient cycling genes had similar or slightly lower abundances in soils with high levels of MPs. The coupling of pollutant factors with MPs as independent variables had significant explanatory power for both positive and negative correlations in PLS-PM analysis. Specifically, PET and PP MPs explained 3.54% and 6.03%, respectively, of the microbial community and functional genes. This study fills knowledge gaps on the effects of MPs on urban soil microbial communities in real environments, facilitating better management of urban green spaces.","Zhou Y., Zhou S.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132141,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Zn@Ta Assisted Dual Cross-Linked 3D Printable Glycol Grafted Chitosan Hydrogels For Robust Antibiofilm And Wound Healing,"Rapid regeneration of the injured tissue or organs is necessary to achieve the usual functionalities of the damaged parts. However, bacterial infections delay the regeneration process, a severe challenge in the personalized healthcare sector. To overcome these challenges, 3D-printable multifunctional hydrogels of Zn/tannic acid-reinforced glycol functionalized chitosan for rapid wound healing were developed. Polyphenol strengthened intermolecular connections, while glutaraldehyde stabilized 3D-printed structures. The hydrogel exhibited enhanced viscoelasticity (G'; 1.96 × 104 Pa) and adhesiveness (210 kPa). The dual-crosslinked scaffolds showed remarkable antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis (∼81 %) and Escherichia coli (92.75 %). The hydrogels showed no adverse effects on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and macrophages (RAW 264.7), indicating their superior biocompatibility. The Zn/TA-reinforced hydrogels accelerate M2 polarization of macrophages through the activation of anti-inflammatory transcription factors (Arg-1, VEGF, CD163, and IL-10), suggesting better immunomodulatory effects, which is favorable for rapid wound regeneration. Higher collagen deposition and rapid re-epithelialization occurred in scaffold-treated rat groups vis-à-vis controls, demonstrating superior wound healing. Taken together, the developed multifunctional hydrogels have great potential for rapidly regenerating bacteria-infected wounds in the personalized healthcare sector.","Patil T.V., Jin H., Dutta S.D., Aacharya R., Chen K., Ganguly K., Randhawa A., Lim K.-T.",10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.122522,Carbohydrate Polymers
Outcomes And Risk Factor Analysis Of Plastic Bronchitis Among 321 Children With Influenza Pneumonia After Bronchoscopy Examination,"Background: Plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare and severe lung disease. It can be triggered by influenza virus infection, which is a common respiratory infection in children. Bronchoscopy can aid in the early detection and treatment of PB. However, the outcomes and risk for PB development in pediatric patients with influenza virus infection are not fully understood. Methods: Data from 321 children diagnosed with influenza virus pneumonia who underwent bronchoscopy examinations between 1st January, 2009 and 31st December, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed to assess the outcomes and risk factors associated with PB development. Results: This study included 97 girls and 224 boys with influenza virus pneumonia with a median age of 42 months. Among them, 36 patients (11.2%) were categorized as having PB based on bronchoscopy findings. PB patients had significantly longer fever durations (p=0.010) and higher risks of developing severe conditions including respiratory failure (p<0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (p<0.001), and air-leak syndrome (p<0.001) compared to non-PB patients. Conventional treatment including the use of neuraminidase inhibitors and antibiotics did not differ between the PB and non-PB patients, but PB patients required more anti-inflammatory treatment (p=0.019) and ventilator support (p<0.001). Combined univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that radiographic findings, including mediastinal emphysema (p=0.012) and lung consolidation (p=0.012), as well as increased levels of neutrophils (p=0.026), aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.004), and lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.001), were identified as risk factors for PB development in patients with influenza virus pneumonia. Although PB patients required more intensive care and had longer hospital stays, they all recovered well after treatment. Conclusion: Influenza virus infection is linked to PB development in children. Identifying risk factors and early intervention such as bronchoscopy can improve the prognosis of children with PB.","Hu Q., Wu J., Wang C., Liang W., Wang Y., Zheng Y., Wen F., Wang W., Yu U.",10.2147/IDR.S405444,Infection And Drug Resistance
Fully Bio-Based Intumescent Flame Retardant Hybrid: A Green Strategy Towards Reducing Fire Hazard And Improving Degradation Of Polylactic Acid,"Polylactic acid (PLA) is a promising renewable polymer material with excellent biodegradability and good mechanical properties. However, the easy flammability and slow natural degradation limited its further applications, especially in high-security fields. In this work, a fully bio-based intumescent flame-retardant system was designed to reduce the fire hazard of PLA. Firstly, arginine (Arg) and phytic acid (PA) were combined through electrostatic ionic interaction, followed by the introduction of starch as a carbon source, namely APS. The UL-94 grade of PLA/APS composites reached V-0 grade by adding 3 wt% of APS and exhibited excellent anti-dripping performance. With APS addition increasing to 7 wt%, LOI value increased to 26 % and total heat release decreased from 58.4 (neat PLA) to 51.1 MJ/m(2). Moreover, the addition of APS increased its crystallinity up to 83.5 % and maintained the mechanical strength of pristine PLA. Noteworthy, APS accelerated the degradation rate of PLA under submerged conditions. Compared with pristine PLA, PLA/APS showed more apparent destructive network morphology and higher mass and M(n) loss, suggesting effective degradation promotion. This work provides a full biomass modification strategy to construct renewable plastic with both good flame retardancy and high degradation efficiency.","Xu F., Ma W., Wang W., Wang H., An S., Zhu Z., Wang R.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.131985,International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules
Μ-Opioid Receptor-Mediated Inhibition Of Intercalated Neurons And Effect On Synaptic Transmission To The Central Amygdala,"The amygdala is a key region for the processing of information underlying fear, anxiety, and fear extinction. Within the local neuronal networks of the amygdala, a population of inhibitory, intercalated neurons (ITCs) modulates the flow of information among various nuclei of amygdala, including the basal nucleus (BA) and the centromedial nucleus (CeM) of the amygdala. These ITCs have been shown to be important during fear extinction and are target of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we provide evidence that the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) by the specific agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin) hyperpolarizes medially located ITCs (mITCs) in acute brain slices of mice. Moreover, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with local electrical stimulation or glutamate uncaging to analyze the effect of MOR activation on local microcircuits. We show that the GABAergic transmission between mITCs and CeM neurons is attenuated by DAMGO, whereas the glutamatergic transmission on CeM neurons and mITCs is unaffected. Furthermore, MOR activation induced by theta burst stimulation in BA suppresses plastic changes of feedforward inhibitory transmission onto CeM neurons as revealed by the MOR antagonist CTAP d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH<inf>2</inf>. In summary, the mITCs constitute a target for the opioid system, and therefore, the activation of MOR in ITCs might play a central role in the modulation of the information processing between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and central nuclei of the amygdala.","Blaesse P., Goedecke L., Bazelot M., Capogna M., Pape H.-C., Jüngling K.",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0204-15.2015,Journal Of Neuroscience
Prevalence And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Of Salmonella Serovars Isolated From U.S. Retail Ground Pork,"One objective of this study was to determine overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from U.S. retail stores over three seasons including both case-ready and store-ground packages. Package types collected included: overwrap, chub, modified atmosphere packaging, and other (plastic or wax paper wrapped). Because package type represents different production systems and are subject to varied microbiological government regulation and testing methodologies, both USDA-FSIS and FDA Salmonella isolation protocols were performed. Another objective of the study was to determine serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates obtained from the ground pork samples. Ground pork aliquots were subjected to real-time PCR. Recovered isolates were serotyped and minimum inhibitory concentration analysis to 15 antimicrobials was determined using microbroth dilution. Overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from the 865 samples collected was 1.39%. Prevalence was not affected by package type (p = 0.29) nor grind location (case-ready vs. store-ground; p = 0.17). Season affected Salmonella prevalence (p = 0.05) with most isolates found during fall, and there was a tendency for geographic region to affect prevalence (p = 0.07). The USDA Salmonella isolation method was more effective at recovering isolates (p = 0.01) compared with the FDA methodology and yielded a kappa statistic of 0.26 as a measure of agreement. The serotypes isolated included: Infantis, 4,5,12:i:-, Brandenburg, Typhimurium var 5-, Seftenberg, and Johannesburg with only two packages containing multiple serotypes. No isolates were resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat human Salmonella infections including extended spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Although the recovery of Salmonella from retail ground pork samples was rare, Salmonella Typhimurium (and its monophasic variant 4,5,12:i:-), which are among the most common serovars recovered from human infections, were recovered. Therefore, more effective strategies to further reduce or eliminate these pathogens from retail pork products are warranted.","Broadway P.R., Chance Brooks J., Mollenkopf D.F., Alexandra Calle M., Loneragan G.H., Miller M.F., Carroll J.A., Sanchez N.C.B., Wittum T.E.",10.1089/fpd.2020.2853,Foodborne Pathogens And Disease
Fty720 Improves The Survival Of Autologous Fat Grafting By Modulating Macrophages Toward M2 Polarization Via Stat3 Pathway,"Autologous fat grafting (AFG) is widely regarded as an important method for breast reconstruction after mastectomy among breast cancer (BC) patients. FTY720 has been proved to affect macrophage polarization and improve the sensitivity of postoperative BC treatment. This study aimed to explore FTY720 function and underlying mechanism in fat transplantation. The C57BL/6 J mice that received AFG were randomly divided into two groups treated with saline and FTY720, respectively. The fat graft samples were obtained at week 1, 2, 4, and 12 post-transplantation. Graft volumes, graft structures, M2 macrophages, and STAT3 protein expression were estimated by histological examination, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and western blot, respectively. In vitro, mouse preadipocytes were stimulated with FTY720 treated-M2 macrophages conditioned medium (FTY720-M2-CM) to evaluate the adipogenesis effect. The level of adipogenic mRNA expression in preadipocytes was detected by RT-PCR. The in vivo results showed that FTY720 treatment significantly enhanced the fat graft retention, structure integrity, and neovascularization, indicating the potential of FTY720 in improving graft survival. The histology results showed more polarized M2 macrophage presented in the FTY720 group. In the in vitro assay, after FTY720-M2-CM treatment, the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed the increased triglyceride content and adipogenic mRNA expression, including FABP4, C/EBP-α, Adipoq, and PPARγ. Furthermore, FTY720 treatment up-regulated the expression level of M2 biomarker CD206, Arg-1, Fizz-1, which could be weakened by the STAT3 inhibitor. Together, this study confirmed the potential efficacy of FTY720 in improving graft survival in the AFG model, possibly mediated by polarizing macrophages to M2 type through activating the STAT3 pathway.","Yi Y., Hu W., Lv W., Zhao C., Xiong M., Wu M., Zhang Q., Wu Y.",10.1177/09636897211052975,Cell Transplantation
Cucumis Metuliferus Reduces Meloidogyne Incognita Virulence Against The Mi1.2 Resistance Gene In A Tomato-Melon Rotation Sequence,"BACKGROUND: Susceptible tomato cv. Durinta, ungrafted or grafted onto cv. Aligator resistant rootstock, both followed by the susceptible melon cv. Paloma, ungrafted or grafted onto Cucumis metuliferus BGV11135, and in the reverse order, were cultivated from 2015 to 2017 in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse, infested or not with Meloidogyne incognita. For each crop, soil nematode densities, galling index, number of eggs per plant and crop yield were determined. Virulence selection was evaluated in pot experiments. RESULTS: In the tomato-melon rotation, nematode densities increased progressively for the grafted tomato, being higher than for ungrafted plants at the end of the study; this was not the case in the melon-tomato rotation. Grafted crops yielded more than ungrafted crops in the infested plots. Virulence against the Mi1.2 gene was detected, but not against C. metuliferus. Reproduction of M. incognita on the resistant tomato was ∼ 120% that on the susceptible cultivar after the first grafted tomato crop, but this decreased to just 25% at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION: Alternating different resistant plant species suppresses nematode population growth rate and yield losses. Although this strategy does not prevent virulence selection, the level was reduced. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.","Expósito A., García S., Giné A., Escudero N., Sorribas F.J.",10.1002/ps.5297,Pest Management Science
The Inflammatory Injury In The Striatal Microglia-Dopaminergic-Neuron Crosstalk Involved In Tourette Syndrome Development,"Background: Tourette syndrome (TS) is associated with immunological dysfunction. The DA system is closely related to TS development, or behavioral stereotypes. Previous evidence suggested that hyper-M1-polarized microglia may exist in the brains of TS individuals. However, the role of microglia in TS and their interaction with dopaminergic neurons is unclear. In this study, we applied iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) to establish a TS model and focused on the inflammatory injury in the striatal microglia-dopaminergic-neuron crosstalk. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with IDPN for seven consecutive days. Stereotypic behavior was observed to verify the TS model. Striatal microglia activation was evaluated based on different markers and expressions of inflammatory factors. The striatal dopaminergic neurons were purified and co-cultured with different microglia groups, and dopamine-associated markers were assessed. Results: First, there was pathological damage to striatal dopaminergic neurons in TS rats, as indicated by decreased expression of TH, DAT, and PITX3. Next, the TS group showed a trend of increased Iba-1 positive cells and elevated levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6, as well as an enhanced M1-polarization marker (iNOS) and an attenuated M2-polarization marker (Arg-1). Finally, in the co-culture experiment, IL-4-treated microglia could upregulate the expression of TH, DAT, and PITX3 in striatal dopaminergic neurons vs LPS-treated microglia. Similarly, the TS group (microglia from TS rats) caused a decreased expression of TH, DAT, and PITX3 compared with the Sham group (microglia from control rats) in the dopaminergic neurons. Conclusion: In the striatum of TS rats, microglia activation is M1 hyperpolarized, which transmits inflammatory injury to striatal dopaminergic neurons and disrupts normal dopamine signaling.","Wang X., Liu X., Chen L., Zhang X.",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1178113,Frontiers In Immunology
Microrna-150 Inhibits Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Proliferation And Function Through Negative Regulation Of Arg-1 In Sepsis,"Aims: Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The majority of sepsis-related deaths occur during late sepsis, which presents as a state of immunosuppression. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been reported to promote immunosuppression during sepsis. Here we aim to understand the role of microRNAs in regulating MDSCs proliferation and immunosuppression function during sepsis. Main methods: Murine sepsis model was established using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). A microarray was used to identify microRNAs with differential expression in murine sepsis. The effect of microRNA-150 on MDSCs proliferation and function was then evaluated. 140 multiple trauma patients from Tongji Hospital and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were taken and the serum level of miR-150 was measured. Key findings: In the murine model of sepsis, MDSCs expansion was noted in the spleen and bone marrow, while expression of miR-150 in MDSCs decreased. Replenishing miR-150 inhibited the expansion of MDSCs in both monocytic and polymorphonuclear subpopulations, as well as decreasing the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs, through down-regulation of ARG1. Both pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-10 were reduced by miR-150. In human, the serum level of miR-150 was down-regulated in septic patients and elevated in non-septic trauma patients compared to healthy controls. Significance: Our study showed that MiR-150 is down-regulated during sepsis. Replenishing miR-150 reduces the immunosuppression function of MDSCs by down-regulating ARG1 in late sepsis. MiR-150 might serve as a potential therapeutic option for sepsis.","Liu Q., Wang Y., Zheng Q., Dong X., Xie Z., Panayi A., Bai X., Li Z.",10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119626,Life Sciences
Mir-367 Alleviates Inflammatory Injury Of Microglia By Promoting M2 Polarization Via Targeting Cebpa,"MiR-367 was reported to regulate inflammatory response of microglia. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPA) could mediate microglia polarization. In this study, we explored the possible roles of miR-367 and CEBPA in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). ICH and normal specimens were obtained from the tissue adjacent to and distant from hematoma of ICH patients, respectively. Microglia were isolated and identified by immunofluorescence. The isolated microglia were treated with erythrocyte lysate and randomly divided into 8 groups using different transfection reagents. The transfection efficiency of miR-367 was determined by qRT-PCR. The expressions of M1 and M2 microglia markers were detected by Western blotting. The relationship between CEBPA and miR-367 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter system. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the level of apoptosis in the cells transfected with miR-367 and CEBPA in erythrocyte lysate-treated microglia. We found that miR-367 expression level was downregulated in ICH specimens. Erythrocyte lysate-treated microglia was successfully established using erythrocyte lysate, as decreased miR-367 expression was observed. Overexpression of miR-367 could significantly decrease the expressions of MHC-ІІ, IL-1β, and Bax, reduced apoptosis rate, and increased the expressions of CD206, Bal-2, and Arg-1 in erythrocyte lysate-treated microglia. CEBPA was proved to be a direct target for miR-367, which could inhibit microglia M2 polarization and increase apoptosis rate. However, in the presence of both CEBPA and miR-367 mimic, the protein and mRNA expressions of CEBPA were decreased, leading to promoted microglia M2 polarization and a decreased apoptosis rate. MiR-367 regulates microglia polarization by targeting CEBPA and is expected to alleviate ICH-induced inflammatory injury.","Pei H., Peng Q., Guo S., Gu Y., Sun T., Xu D., Jiang Y., Xie J., Zhang L., Zhu Z.",10.1007/s11626-020-00519-5,In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology.

Experimentally Validated Oxidative Stress -Associated Prognostic Signatures Describe The Immune Landscape And Predict The Drug Response And Prognosis Of Skcm,"Background: Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) incidence is continually increasing, with chemotherapy and immunotherapy being among the most common cancer treatment modalities. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers for chemotherapy and immunotherapy response in SKCM and explore their association with oxidative stress. Methods: Utilizing TCGA-SKCM RNA-seq data, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks to identify six core genes. Gene co-expression analysis and immune-related analysis were conducted, and specific markers associated with oxidative stress were identified using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Single-cell analysis revealed the expression patterns of Oxidative Stress-Associated Genes (OSAG) in the tumor microenvironment. TIDE analysis was employed to explore the association between immune therapy response and OSAG, while CIBERSORT was used to analyze the tumor immune microenvironment. The BEST database demonstrated the impact of the Oxidative Stress signaling pathway on chemotherapy drug resistance. Immunohistochemical staining and ROC curve evaluation were performed to assess the protein expression levels of core genes in SKCM and normal samples, with survival analysis utilized to determine their diagnostic value. Results: We identified six central genes associated with SKCM metastasis, among which the expression of DSC2 and DSC3 involved in the oxidative stress pathway was closely related to immune cell infiltration. DSC2 influenced drug resistance in SKMC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of DSC2 and DSC3 expression enhanced the response of SKCM patients to immunotherapy. Conclusion: This study identified two Oxidative Stress-Associated genes as novel biomarkers for SKCM. Additionally, targeting the oxidative stress pathway may serve as a new strategy in clinical practice to enhance SKCM chemotherapy and sensitivity.","Rong D., Su Y., Jia D., Zeng Z., Yang Y., Wei D., Lu H., Cao Y.",10.3389/fimmu.2024.1387316,Frontiers In Immunology
Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass After Failed Vertical Banded Gastroplasty: 2-Year Follow-Up Of 102 Patients,"Background: Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) is now discarded from being a restrictive procedure for morbid obesity due to its many drawbacks, doubtful efficacy, and lots of post-operative complications. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed procedure for VBG revision. So we aimed at reporting our experience in conversional RYGB for a failed VBG. Material and Methods: Analyzing follow-up records of 102 patients who underwent revisional RYGB after failed VBG in the period from April 2014 to January 2018. Results: A total of 102 laparoscopic revisions of failed VBGs to RYGB were performed. The mean operating time was 161.9 min ±29.2 and the mean length of the hospital stay was 1.5 days ±1.2. Fourteen patients (13%) developed early post-operative complications (gastrojejunostomy leak 5; bleeding 9). Four patients (4.7%) developed late complications (Port site hernia 2; internal hernia 1; Stomal ulcer 1). The mean BMI pre-RYGB was 46.6 ± 5.9 kg/m(2), and the mean %EBWL (percent excess body weight lost) of the patients at 12 and 24 months post-revision were 56.2% and 64.3%, respectively. Our patients had immediate post-revision resolution of VBG-related complications like dysphagia and vomiting. We also report improvement in all obesity-related health problems with (75.7%) complete remission rate and (24.3%) partial remission or improvement rate of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Conversion of VBG to RYGB is a feasible procedure and is associated with acceptable early morbidity rates and reduced lengths of hospitalization also it provides acceptable weight loss and improvement in obesity-related health problems.

"A Review Of Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma Therapies And Their Mechanisms, From Immunotherapies To Lysine Histone Methyl Transferase Inhibitors","Advanced cutaneous melanoma is considered to be the most aggressive type of skin cancer and has variable rates of treatment response. Currently, there are some classes of immunotherapy and target therapies for its treatment. Immunotherapy can inhibit tumor growth and its recurrence by triggering the host’s immune system, whereas targeted therapy inhibits specific molecules or signaling pathways. However, melanoma responses to these treatments are highly heterogeneous, and patients can develop resistance. Epigenomics (DNA/histone modifications) contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Epigenetic alterations are divided into four levels of gene expression regulation: DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation. Deregulation of lysine methyltransferase enzymes is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, development of metastases, changes in the immune microenvironment, and drug resistance. The study of lysine histone methyltransferase (KMT) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) inhibitors is important for understanding cancer epigenetic mechanisms and biological processes. In addition to immunotherapy and target therapy, the research and development of KMT and NNMT inhibitors is ongoing. Many studies are exploring the therapeutic implications and possible side effects of these compounds, in addition to their adjuvant potential to the approved current therapies. Importantly, as with any drug development, safety, efficacy, and specificity are crucial considerations when developing methyltransferase inhibitors for clinical applications. Thus, this review article presents the recently available therapies and those in development for advanced cutaneous melanoma therapy.","De Oliveira Filho R.S., De Oliveira D.A., Nisimoto M.M., Marti L.C.",10.3390/cancers15245751,Cancers
Nodal Induced By Hypoxia Exposure Contributes To Dacarbazine Resistance And The Maintenance Of Stemness In Melanoma Cancer Stem-Like Cells,"Nodal signaling has a critical role in the processes of embryogenesis and is necessary for maintaining cell stemness. However, its upregulation in melanoma is positively correlated with malignant potential, including cancer progression, metastasis and recurrence, and a recent report has revealed its role in promoting self-renewal capacity in melanoma. Our study aimed to explore the effects of hypoxia exposure, which is one of the main causes of chemoresistance in melanoma, on the physiological processes of melanoma cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) via regulating Nodal. A375 CSCs were enriched by culturing in serum-free medium (SFM) and were analyzed for the expression levels of Nodal and its correlated proteins by semi-quantitative western blotting. Lentiviral-packaged Nodal coding sequence or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) was employed. After hypoxia exposure, the effects on glucose uptake, ATP production and O(2) consumption were detected, and whether Nodal contributed to the proliferation, invasion, colony formation, self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance was evaluated. We demonstrated that hypoxia exposure induced Nodal expression and activated the Smad2/3 pathway in A375 CSCs. Hypoxic-induced Nodal partially promoted dacarbazine resistance, promoted invasion and self-renewal capacity, but not proliferation which was further confirmed using Nodal knockdown. Blockage of Nodal signaling activity with the small-molecule inhibitor SB431542 partially reversed Nodal-induced chemoresistance. Nodal knockdown further sensitized A375 CSCs to dacarbazine after SB431542 pretreatment, indicating the involvement of proNodal in dacarbazine resistance. The introduction of mut-proNodal induced chemoresistance further confirming the role of proNodal in this process. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Nodal induced by hypoxia exposure induced a malignant phenotype and chemoresistance in A375 CSCs, and proNodal also contributed to these processes, indicating that Nodal may be a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.","Li H., Chen J., Wang X., He M., Zhang Z., Cen Y.",10.3892/or.2018.6387,Oncology Reports
Rocking- And Diffusion-Based Culture Of Tumor Spheroids-On-A-Chip,"Tumor spheroids are now intensively investigated toward preclinical and clinical applications, necessitating the establishment of accessible and cost-effective methods for routine operations. Without losing the advantage of organ-chip technologies, we developed a rocking system for facile formation and culture of tumor spheroids in hydrogel microwells of a suspended membrane under microfluidic conditions. While the rocking is controlled with a step motor, the microfluidic device is made of two plastic plates, allowing plugging directly syringe tubes with Luer connectors. Upon injection of the culture medium into the tubes and subsequent rocking of the chip, the medium flows back and forth in the channel underneath the membrane, ensuring a diffusion-based culture. Our results showed that such a rocking- and diffusion-based culture method significantly improved the quality of the tumor spheroids when compared to the static culture, particularly in terms of growth rate, roundness, junction formation and compactness of the spheroids. Notably, dynamically cultured tumor spheroids showed increased drug resistance, suggesting alternative assay conditions. Overall, the present method is pumpless, connectionless, and user-friendly, thereby facilitating the advancement of tumor-spheroid-based applications.","Tian D., Mao Z., Wang L., Huang X., Wang W., Luo H., Peng J., Chen Y.",10.1039/d3lc01116j,Lab On A Chip
"Ouabain Exhibited Strong Anticancer Effects In Melanoma Cells Via Induction Of Apoptosis, G2/M Phase Arrest, And Migration Inhibition","Background: Malignant melanoma was characterized by insensitive chemotherapy, drug resistance, and high metastatic ability, which resulted in the main reason for the mortality among skin-related cancers. The current agents were not sufficient to improve the treatment status of melanoma patients, and it was still needed to develop new chemotherapeutic drugs for melanoma. Our study aimed to study the anticancer effects and potential mechanisms of ouabain on melanoma cells. Methods: The inhibitory effects of ouabain were determined by CCK8 and colony formation assays, and the morphological changes of melanoma cells were observed by inverted microscope. The apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were detected by annexin V/ PI double staining and PI staining, respectively. The expression of the biomarker proteins in apoptosis and G2/M phase were determined by Western blotting analysis. The effects of ouabain on the migration of melanoma cells were measured by transwell migration assay and wound closure analysis. The potential mechanisms of ouabain in melanoma cells were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Results: Our present study demonstrated that ouabain exhibited strong inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and triggered dramatical morphological changes of melanoma cells. Moreover, ouabain induced significant apoptosis in A375 rather than SK-Mel-28 cells via upregulation of bax expression and downregulation of bcl-2 expression. Consistently, oua-bain treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in both A375 and SK-Mel-28 cells via upregulation of cyclin B1 and downregulation of cdc2 and cdc25c. Importantly, ouabain suppressed the migration of A375 and SK-Mel-28 cells. Furthermore, the transcriptome sequencing demonstrated that p53 and MAPK signaling pathway might play important roles in the inhibitory effects of ouabain. Conclusion: Our study revealed that ouabain exhibited dramatical anticancer effects, which provided a novel application for cardiac glycoside drugs in the clinical treatment of melanoma.","Wang L., Cai W., Han B., Zhang J., Yu B., Chen M.",10.2147/OTT.S283548,Oncotargets And Therapy
Bacterial Infection Profile And Predictors Among Patients Admitted To A Burn Care Center: A Retrospective Study,"Background: Infection is the main cause of mortality and complications in burn patients. The present study was the first to examine the local profile and antecedents of bacterial infections among patients admitted to a Lebanese burn care center. Methods: The present study was a retrospective analysis of the occurrence and recurrence of infection, its characteristics as well as antimicrobial susceptibility among 475 patients admitted to the Burn Centre at the Lebanese Geitaoui Hospital between January 2014 and December 2018. Results: 55% of patients contracted at least one infection during their hospitalization. Length of stay (LOS), sepsis, wound dressing under anesthesia, blood transfusion and female sex independently and positively predicted infection in burn patients. Infection was predominately caused by Staphylococcus aureus (48.7%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.6%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7%). Bacterial isolates were predominately multi-drug or extensively drug resistant and showed variable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Recurrent infections occurred in 44.1% of infected burn patients, and were independently predicted by LOS (p = 0.004), sepsis (p = 0.001), surgery (p = 0.003), burn excision and skin grafting (p = 0.019), and central line insertion (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Existing burn management and infection control measures must be revised in order to reduce the incidence and improve the treatment of infections in burn patients.","Bourgi J., Said J.-M., Yaakoub C., Atallah B., Al Akkary N., Sleiman Z., Ghanimé G.",10.1016/j.burns.2020.05.004,Burns
Skin And Surface Disinfection Challenges For The Emerging Pathogen Candida Auris,"Objective: Since its emergence in 2009, the fungal pathogen Candida auris has received considerable attention due to its resistant phenotype and its ability to exist within the healthcare environment. The impact on transmission and infection control is substantial, so understanding the mechanisms of spread and survival within this setting is critical. It has been shown to persist for prolonged periods on a number of fomites, as well as being able to successfully colonise the skin resulting in patient to patient transmission. Methods: Four C. auris clinical isolates were used throughout this study, with C. albicans and C. glabrata used as comparators. Surface disinfection testing was performed using three different substrates: cellulose matrix, plastic and stainless steel. Following adhesion, cells were then treated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) or peracetic acid (PA) for 5 min before neutralisation. Cell viability was quantified using CFU plating and re-growth analysis. The efficacy of skin disinfectants was also analysed using a complex, 3-D biofilm model. Following growth for 1.5 or 48 hours, biofilms were challenged with clinically relevant concentrations of 10% povidone iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine (2%, 0.05%) and 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ) with viable cells quantified using miles and misra and qPCR. In addition, untreated and treated samples were viewed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: The cellulose matrix was shown to be the most susceptible surface, with complete eradication achieved with both NaOCl and PA. No viable cells were recovered from the plastic substrate following treatment with PA, standard NaOCl treatment was shown to reduce by <2-log, therefore increased concentrations and contact times were needed to substantially reduce cell viability. Steel was significantly the most resilient substrate (P < 0.01), with 3 log reductions observed against NaOCl and PA, regardless of concentration and contact time. For skin disinfection testing, mature biofilms were shown to be significantly less susceptible than early biofilms to both CHX treatments and H2O2 (P < 0.001), with PVP-I completely eradicating both biofilms. Conclusion: Given the highly drug resistant phenotype of C auris, then its control within the clinical environment is critical. The study highlights the potential deficits associated with controlling this emerging organism, and only through the understanding of its mechanisms of survival and resistance with assist in devising new therapeutics and control interventions.","Kean R., Short B., Mckloud E., Sherry L., Williams C., Ramage G.",10.1093/mmy/myy036,Medical Mycology
Functional And Genomic Insights Into The Biotechnological Potential Of Vibrio Spp. Isolated From Deeply Polluted And Pristine Environments,"Vibrio spp. are remarkably diverse bacteria, being worthy of investigation not only for their antibiotic resistance and virulence, but also for their biotechnological potential. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that these bacteria display industrially relevant traits, particularly as producers of antimicrobial substances, tensioactive/emulsifying compounds, and enzymes. Here, our aim was to investigate the potential of Vibrio strains isolated from two different marine sources to produce such biotechnologically applicable substances. From the eighteen analyzed strains, five were isolated from plastic particles from a heavily polluted urban estuary and 13 from calcareous sponges inhabiting submarine caves in an isolated volcanic archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. Enzymatic screening revealed that most strains were agarolytic and cellulolytic. Overall, six strains showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29,213, with four of them active towards Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922 as well. Additionally, eight strains were positive for the production of bioemulsifiers. Genomic analyses of four strains further revealed insights regarding the enzymatic arsenal, as shown by the detection of several key gene clusters pertaining to the chitin degradation pathway, and also encoding diverse classes of antimicrobial-active metabolites. Our findings highlight the biotechnological potential of Vibrio spp., evidencing their functional diversity and the need for continued and sustained prospecting of this bacterial genus to uncover its potential high-value-added bioproducts.","Canellas A.L.B., De Oliveira Nithack Marques M., Lopes M.V., Lage A., Klautau M., Muricy G., De Oliveira B.F.R., Laport M.S.",10.1007/s00284-024-04013-z,Current Microbiology
Structural Studies Of Klebsiella Pneumoniae Fosfomycin-Resistance Protein And Its Application For The Development Of An Optical Biosensor For Fosfomycin Determination,"Fosfomycin-resistance proteins (FosAs) are dimeric metal-dependent glutathione transferases that conjugate the antibiotic fosfomycin (Fos) to the tripeptide glutathione (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly, GSH), rendering it inactive. In the present study, we reported a comparative analysis of the functional features of two FosAs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FosAPA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (FosAKP). The coding sequences of the enzymes were cloned into a T7 expression vector, and soluble active enzymes were expressed in E. coli. FosAKP displayed higher activity and was selected for further studies. The crystal structure of the dimeric FosAKP was determined via X-ray crystallography at 1.48 Å resolution. Fos and tartrate (Tar) were found bound in the active site of the first and second molecules of the dimer, respectively. The binding of Tar to the active site caused slight rearrangements in the structure and dynamics of the enzyme, acting as a weak inhibitor of Fos binding. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to measure the thermal stability of FosAKP under different conditions, allowing for the selection of a suitable buffer to maximize enzyme operational stability. FosAKP displays absolute specificity towards Fos; therefore, this enzyme was exploited for the development of an enzyme-based colorimetric biosensor. FosAKP was tethered at the bottom of a plastic cuvette using glutaraldehyde chemistry to develop a simple colorimetric method for the determination of Fos in drinking water and animal plasma.","Varotsou C., Ataya F., Papageorgiou A.C., Labrou N.E.",10.3390/ijms25010085,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Eradication Of Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas Biofilm With Pulsed Electric Fields,"Biofilm formation is a significant problem, accounting for over eighty percent of microbial infections in the body. Biofilm eradication is problematic due to increased resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobials as compared to planktonic cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) on biofilm-infected mesh. Prolene mesh was infected with bioluminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated with PEF using a concentric electrode system to derive, in a single experiment, the critical electric field strength needed to kill bacteria. The effect of the electric field strength and the number of pulses (with a fixed pulse length duration and frequency) on bacterial eradication was investigated. For all experiments, biofilm formation and disruption were confirmed with bioluminescent imaging and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Computation and statistical methods were used to analyze treatment efficiency and to compare it to existing theoretical models. In all experiments 1500V are applied through a central electrode, with pulse duration of 50μs, and pulse delivery frequency of 2Hz. We found that the critical electric field strength (Ecr) needed to eradicate 100-80% of bacteria in the treated area was 121±14V/mm when 300 pulses were applied, and 235±6.1V/mm when 150 pulses were applied. The area at which 100-80% of bacteria were eradicated was 50.5±9.9mm(2) for 300 pulses, and 13.4±0.65mm(2) for 150 pulses. 80% threshold eradication was not achieved with 100 pulses. The results indicate that increased efficacy of treatment is due to increased number of pulses delivered. In addition, we that showed the bacterial death rate as a function of the electrical field follows the statistical Weibull model for 150 and 300pulses. We hypothesize that in the clinical setting, combining systemic antibacterial therapy with PEF will yield a synergistic effect leading to improved eradication of mesh infections.","Khan S.I., Blumrosen G., Vecchio D., Golberg A., Mccormack M.C., Yarmush M.L., Hamblin M.R., Austen W.G.",10.1002/bit.25818,Biotechnology And Bioengineering
Emergence Of Mcr-1 Mediated Colistin Resistant Escherichia Coli From A Hospitalized Patient In Bangladesh,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of plasmid mediated mcr in bacteria has become global public health threat. Herein, we report a mcr-1 positive E. coli in normal human flora from a patient admitted in Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). METHODOLOGY: In total, 700 non-duplicate rectal swabs were collected from DMCH during 13th May to 12th June 2018. E. coli from rectal swabs were isolated on chromogenic UTI media containing vancomycin 10mg/l (Liofilchem, Italy) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by agar dilution and interpreted according to EUCAST breakpoints. Genomic analysis of mcr positive E. coli (MCRPEC) was performed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using S1 nuclease DNA digests and blamcr-1 probing. Transferability of blamcr-1 were determined by conjugation assays. RESULTS: We found one MCRPEC from 700 rectal swab screening which was isolated from the rectal swab culture of a 17-year boy who was admitted to the burns ICU, DMCH with 53% flame burn involving much of the trunk and face. Genome sequencing revealed that mcr-1 was present on an IncH12 plasmid of 257,243 bp and flanked by ISApaI1. The colistin resistance can be transferred to the recipient Klebsiella varricola with a frequency of 8.3 × 10-5. Transconjugants were more resistant to colistin than donor (MIC 32 µg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first human associated mcr in Bangladesh. These data indicate the need for a systematic ""one health"" surveillance in the country.","Farzana R., Jones L.S., Rahman M.A., Toleman M.A., Sands K., Portal E., Boostrom I., Kalam M.A., Hassan B., Uddin A.N., Walsh T.R.",10.3855/jidc.11541,Journal Of Infection In Developing Countries
Cancer Stem Cells And The Slow Cycling Phenotype: How To Cut The Gordian Knot Driving Resistance To Therapy In Melanoma,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have historically been defined as slow cycling elements that are able to differentiate into mature cells but without dedifferentiation in the opposite direction. Thanks to advances in genomic and non-genomic technologies, the CSC theory has more recently been reconsidered in a dynamic manner according to a “phenotype switching” plastic model. Transcriptional reprogramming rewires this plasticity and enables heterogeneous tumors to influence cancer progression and to adapt themselves to drug exposure by selecting a subpopulation of slow cycling cells, similar in nature to the originally defined CSCs. This model has been conceptualized for malignant melanoma tailored to explain resistance to target therapies. Here, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of available data directed to the identification of the molecular pathways sustaining slow cycling melanoma stem cells. Using this approach, we identified a signature of 25 genes that were assigned to four major clusters, namely 1) kinases and metabolic changes, 2) melanoma-associated proteins, 3) Hippo pathway and 4) slow cycling/CSCs factors. Furthermore, we show how a protein−protein interaction network may be the main driver of these melanoma cell subpopulations. Finally, mining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data we evaluated the expression levels of this signature in the four melanoma mutational subtypes. The concomitant alteration of these genes correlates with the worst overall survival (OS) for melanoma patients harboring BRAF-mutations. All together these results underscore the potentiality to target this signature to selectively kill CSCs and to achieve disease control in melanoma.","Fattore L., Mancini R., Ciliberto G.",10.3390/cancers12113368,Cancers
Increase In Gray Matter Volume And White Matter Fractional Anisotropy In The Motor Pathways Of Patients With Secondarily Generalized Neocortical Seizures,"Purpose Convulsive motor activity is a clinical manifestation of secondarily generalized seizures evolving from different focal regions. The way in which the motor seizures present themselves is not very different from most of the generalized seizures in and between epilepsy patients. This might point towards the involvement of motor-related cortices and corticospinal pathway for wide spread propagation of epileptic activity. Our aim was to identify changes in the cerebral structures and to correlate clinical variables with structural changes particularly in the motor-related cortices and pathway of patients with generalized convulsions from different seizure foci. Methods Sixteen patients with focal onset and secondarily generalized seizures were included, along with sixteen healthy volunteers. Structural differences were analysed by measuring grey matter (GM) volume and thickness via T1-weighted MRI, and white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) via diffusion tensor imaging. GM and WM microstructural properties were compared between patients and controls by voxel- and surface- based analyses. Next, morphometric findings were correlated with seizure severity and disease duration to identify the pathologic process. Key findings In addition to widely reduced GM and WM properties, increased GM volume in the bilateral precentral gyri and paracentral lobules, and elevated regional FA in the bilateral corticospinal tracts adjacent to these motor -related GM were observed in patients and with higher statistical difference in the sub-patient group with drug-resistance. Significance The increment of GM volume and WM FA in the motor pathway positively correlated with severity and duration of epilepsy. The demonstrated microstructural changes of motor pathways imply a plastic process of motor networks in the patients with frequent generalization of focal seizures.","Hsin Y.-L., Harnod T., Chang C.-S., Peng S.-J.",10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.09.011,Epilepsy Research
Potassium Ion Channels In Malignant Central Nervous System Cancers,"Malignant central nervous system (CNS) cancers are among the most difficult to treat, with low rates of survival and a high likelihood of recurrence. This is primarily due to their location within the CNS, hindering adequate drug delivery and tumour access via surgery. Furthermore, CNS cancer cells are highly plastic, an adaptive property that enables them to bypass targeted treatment strategies and develop drug resistance. Potassium ion channels have long been implicated in the progression of many cancers due to their integral role in several hallmarks of the disease. Here, we will explore this relationship further, with a focus on malignant CNS cancers, including high-grade glioma (HGG). HGG is the most lethal form of primary brain tumour in adults, with the majority of patient mortality attributed to drug-resistant secondary tumours. Hence, targeting proteins that are integral to cellular plasticity could reduce tumour recurrence, improving survival. This review summarises the role of potassium ion channels in malignant CNS cancers, specifically how they contribute to proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and plasticity. We will also explore how specific modulation of these proteins may provide a novel way to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcomes.","Boyle Y., Johns T.G., Fletcher E.V.",10.3390/cancers14194767,Cancers
Application Of Adoptive Cell Therapy In Malignant Melanoma,"Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive skin cancers originating from skin pigment cells. Patients with advanced melanoma suffer a poor prognosis and generally cannot benefit well from surgical resection and chemo/target therapy due to metastasis and drug resistance. Thus, adoptive cell therapy (ACT), employing immune cells with specific tumor-recognizing receptors, has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to display on-tumor toxicity. This review discusses the application, efficacy, limitations, as well as future prospects of four commonly utilized approaches -including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, engineered T-cell receptor T cells, and chimeric antigen receptor NK cells- in the context of malignant melanoma.","Hu Q., Xuan J., Wang L., Shen K., Gao Z., Zhou Y., Wei C., Gu J.",10.1186/s12967-025-06093-2,Journal Of Translational Medicine
Responses Of Bacterial Communities And Resistance Genes On Microplastics To Antibiotics And Heavy Metals In Sewage Environment,"In present study, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), tetracycline (TC) and ampicillin (AMP) were selected to study the individual and synergistic effects of antibiotics and heavy metals on the microbial communities and resistance genes on polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC MPs) and surrounding sewage after 28 and 84 days. The results indicated that PVC MPs enriched many microorganisms from surrounding sewage, especially pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium and Aquabacterium. The resistance gene with the highest abundance enriched on PVC MPs was tnpA (average abundance of 1.0 × 10(7) copies/mL sewage). The single presence of Zn, TC and AMP inhibited these enrichments for a short period of time (28 days). But the single presence of Cu and the co-existence of antibiotics and heavy metals inhibited these enrichments for a long period of time (84 days), resulting in relatively low microbial diversities and resistance genes abundances. Transpose tnpA had significantly positive correlations (p < 0.05) with all other genes. Pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium and Legionella were potential hosts harboring 5 and 1 resistance genes, respectively. Overall, PVC MPs played important roles in the distribution and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in sewage with the presence of antibiotics or (and) heavy metals.","Zhao Y., Gao J., Wang Z., Dai H., Wang Y.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123550,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Photothermal Ablation Of Inflammatory Breast Cancer Tumor Emboli Using Plasmonic Gold Nanostars,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare, but it is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. IBC has a unique presentation of diffuse tumor cell clusters called tumor emboli in the dermis of the chest wall that block lymph vessels causing a painful, erythematous, and edematous breast. Lack of effective therapeutic treatments has caused mortality rates of this cancer to reach 20%–30% in case of women with stage III–IV disease. Plasmonic nanoparticles, via photothermal ablation, are emerging as lead candidates in next-generation cancer treatment for site-specific cell death. Plasmonic gold nanostars (GNS) have an extremely large two-photon luminescence cross-section that allows real-time imaging through multiphoton microscopy, as well as superior photothermal conversion efficiency with highly concentrated heating due to its tip-enhanced plasmonic effect. To effectively study the use of GNS as a clinically plausible treatment of IBC, accurate three-dimensional (3D) preclinical models are needed. Here, we demonstrate a unique in vitro preclinical model that mimics the tumor emboli structures assumed by IBC in vivo using IBC cell lines SUM149 and SUM190. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GNS are endocytosed into multiple cancer cell lines irrespective of receptor status or drug resistance and that these nanoparticles penetrate the tumor embolic core in 3D culture, allowing effective photothermal ablation of the IBC tumor emboli. These results not only provide an avenue for optimizing the diagnostic and therapeutic application of GNS in the treatment of IBC but also support the continuous development of 3D in vitro models for investigating the efficacy of photothermal therapy as well as to further evaluate photothermal therapy in an IBC in vivo model.","Crawford B.M., Shammas R.L., Fales A.M., Brown D.A., Hollenbeck S.T., Vo-Dinh T., Devi G.R.",10.2147/IJN.S141164,International Journal Of Nanomedicine
Brd4 Degradation Enhanced Glioma Sensitivity To Temozolomide By Regulating Notch1 Via Glu-Modified Gsh-Responsive Nanoparticles,"Temozolomide (TMZ) serves as the principal chemotherapeutic agent for glioma; nonetheless, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised by the rapid emergence of drug resistance, the inadequate targeting of glioma cells, and significant systemic toxicity. ARV-825 may play a role in modulating drug resistance by degrading the BRD4 protein, thereby exerting anti-glioma effects. Therefore, to surmount TMZ resistance and achieve efficient and specific drug delivery, a dual-targeted glutathione (GSH)-responsive nanoparticle system (T+A@Glu-NP) is designed and synthesized for the co-delivery of ARV-825 and TMZ. As anticipated, T+A@Glu-NPs significantly enhanced penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), facilitated drug uptake by glioma cells, and exhibited efficient accumulation in brain tissue. Additionally, T+A@Glu-NPs exhibited augmented efficacy against glioma both in vitro and in vivo through the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation, and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, mechanistic exploration revealed that T+A@Glu-NPs degraded the BRD4 protein, leading to the downregulation of Notch1 gene transcription and the inhibition of the Notch1 signaling pathway, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of glioma chemotherapy. Taken together, the findings suggest that T+A@Glu-NPs represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for glioma chemotherapy.","Yi L., Zhang Z., Zhou W., Zhang Y., Hu Y., Guo A., Cheng Y., Qian Z., Zhou P., Gao X.",10.1002/advs.202409753,"Advanced Science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
Beyond Static Models: Mechanically Dynamic Matrices Reveal New Insights Into Cancer And Fibrosis Progression,"The dynamic mechanical nature of extracellular matrices (ECMs) is crucial for the mechanosensitive regulation of cell fate. This is evident in pathological conditions such as cancer and fibrosis, which are characterised by highly fibrotic tissue developing over time. This fibrotic progression not only alters tissue mechanics, but also coincides with the reprogramming of resident cells, promoting their differentiation into aberrant phenotypes and increasing drug resistance. Hydrogels, with their tuneable mechanical and biochemical properties, emerge as powerful ECM mimetics to model and study these abnormal, mechanically-driven cell differentiation phenomena. In this review, after establishing how conventional, mechanically static hydrogels contribute to our understanding of the role of altered mechanosensing in cell differentiation during cancer and fibrosis, we explore the research opportunities given by advanced dynamic matrices. Models employing hydrogels that are fast relaxing, plastic or even with temporally switchable mechanics reveal the otherwise hidden role of time-dependent phenomena during disease development.","Walker M., Gourdon D., Cantini M.",10.1016/j.cobme.2024.100570,Current Opinion In Biomedical Engineering
Smart Nanoparticles For Breast Cancer Treatment Based On The Tumor Microenvironment,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignant tumor in women. There are different risk characteristics and treatment strategies for different subtypes of BC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is of great significance for understanding the occurrence, development, and metastasis of tumors. The TME plays an important role in all stages of BC metastasis, immune monitoring, immune response avoidance, and drug resistance, and also plays an important role in the diagnosis, prevention, and prognosis of BC. Smart nanosystems have broad development prospect in the regulation of the BC drug delivery based on the response of the TME. In particular, TME-responsive nanoparticles cleverly utilize the abnormal features of BC tissues and cells to achieve targeted transport, stable release, and improved efficacy. We here present a review of the mechanisms underlying the response of the TME to BC to provide potential nanostrategies for future BC treatment.","Luo X., Zhang Q., Chen H., Hou K., Zeng N., Wu Y.",10.3389/fonc.2022.907684,Frontiers In Oncology
Extracellular Matrix-Mediated Regulation Of Cancer Stem Cells And Chemoresistance,"The identity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains an enigma, with the question outstanding of whether CSCs are fixed entities or plastic cell states in response to microenvironmental cues. Recent evidence highlights the power of the tumor microenvironment to dictate CSC functionality and spatiotemporal regulation that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity. This microenvironmental regulation of CSCs parallels that of normal tissues, whereby resident stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or ‘niches’, which provide the cellular and molecular signals that wire every aspect of stem cell behavior and fate. The extracellular matrix (ECM), along with its sequestered growth factors, is a fundamental component of the stem cell niche. Pathological ECM remodeling is an established hallmark of cancer, with the ECM a key mediator of metastasis and drug resistance. In this review, we discuss the controversial identity of CSCs and new understanding of the impact of tumor microenvironment on CSC function and phenotype. We outline parallels between development, wound repair and cancer to discuss how changes in ECM dynamics influence stem cell function during normal physiological processes and pathological states, as well as the transition between the two in the form of precancerous lesions. We then explore examples illustrating the molecular circuits partnering cancer cells with stromal cells and how this communication involving ECM imparts a CSC phenotype and promotes chemoresistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CSC functionality and chemoresistance, along with mathematical modeling approaches and advancing technologies for targeting the undruggable proteome, should open opportunities for cancer breakthroughs in the future.","Brown Y., Hua S., Tanwar P.S.",10.1016/j.biocel.2019.02.002,International Journal Of Biochemistry And Cell Biology
Cell Penetrating Peptides: A Versatile Vector For Co-Delivery Of Drug And Genes In Cancer,"Biological barriers hamper the efficient delivery of drugs and genes to targeted sites. Cell penetrating peptides (CPP) have the ability to rapidly internalize across biological membranes. CPP have been effective for delivery of various chemotherapeutic agents used to combat cancer. CPP can enhance delivery of drugs to a targeted site when combined with tumor targeting peptides. CPP can be linked with various cargos like nanoparticles, micelles and liposomes to deliver drugs and genes to the cancer cell. Here, we focus on CPP mediated delivery of drugs to the tumor sites, delivery of genes (siRNA,pDNA) and co-delivery of drugs and genes to combat drug resistance.","Khan M.M., Filipczak N., Torchilin V.P.",10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.11.028,Journal Of Controlled Release
Impact Of Microplastics And Nanoplastics On Livestock Health: An Emerging Risk For Reproductive Efficiency,"Pollution due to microplastics and nanoplastics is one of the major environmental issues of the last decade and represents a growing threat to human and animal health. In aquatic species, there is a large amount of information regarding the perturbation of marine organisms; instead, there are only a few studies focusing on the pathophysiological consequences of an acute and chronic exposure to micro- and nanoplastics in mammalian systems, especially on the reproductive system. There are several studies that have described the damage caused by plastic particles, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammatory response, dysregulation of the endocrine system and accumulation in various organs. In addition to this, microplastics have recently been found to influence the evolution of microbial communities and increase the gene exchange, including antibiotic and metal resistance genes. Special attention must be paid to farm animals, because they produce food such as milk, eggs and meat, with the consequent risk of biological amplification along the food chain. The results of several studies indicate that there is an accumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics in human and animal tissues, with several negative effects, but all the effects in the body have not been ascertained, especially considering the long-term consequences. This review provides an overview of the possible adverse effects of the exposure of livestock to micro- and nanoplastics and assesses the potential risks for the disruption of reproductive physiological functions.","Urli S., Corte Pause F., Crociati M., Baufeld A., Monaci M., Stradaioli G.",10.3390/ani13071132,Animals
Multifunctional Antimicrobial Nanofiber Dressings Containing Ε-Polylysine For The Eradication Of Bacterial Bioburden And Promotion Of Wound Healing In Critically Colonized Wounds,"Bacterial colonization of acute and chronic wounds is often associated with delayed wound healing and prolonged hospitalization. The rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria and the poor biocompatibility of topical antimicrobials warrant safe and effective antimicrobials. Antimicrobial agents that target microbial membranes without interfering with the mammalian cell proliferation and migration hold great promise in the treatment of traumatic wounds. This article reports the utility of superhydrophilic electrospun gelatin nanofiber dressings (NFDs) containing a broad-spectrum antimicrobial polymer, ε-polylysine (εPL), crosslinked by polydopamine (pDA) for treating second-degree burns. In a porcine model of partial thickness burns, NFDs promoted wound closure and reduced hypertrophic scarring compared to untreated burns. Analysis of NFDs in contact with the burns indicated that the dressings trap early colonizers and elicit bactericidal activity, thus creating a sterile wound bed for fibroblasts migration and re-epithelialization. In support of these observations, in porcine models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus colonized partial thickness burns, NFDs decreased bacterial bioburden and promoted wound closure and re-epithelialization. NFDs displayed superior clinical outcome than standard-of-care silver dressings. The excellent biocompatibility and antimicrobial efficacy of the newly developed dressings in pre-clinical models demonstrate its potential for clinical use to manage infected wounds without compromising tissue regeneration.","Mayandi V., Wen Choong A.C., Dhand C., Lim F.P., Aung T.T., Sriram H., Dwivedi N., Periayah M.H., Sridhar S., Fazil M.H.U.T., Goh E.T.L., Orive G., W Beuerman R., Barkham T.M.S., Loh X.J., Liang Z.-X., Barathi V.A., Ramakrishna S., Chong S.J., Verma N.K., Lakshminarayanan R.",10.1021/acsami.9b21683,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Phytotoxic Effects Of Polyethylene Microplastics Combined With Cadmium On The Photosynthetic Performance Of Maize (Zea Mays L.),"Microplastics (MPs) and cadmium (Cd) has attracted increasing attention due to their combined toxicity to terrestrial vegetation. Photosynthesis which utilizes light energy to synthesize organic substances is crucial for crop production. However, the plant photosynthetic response to the joint toxicity of MPs and Cd is still unknown. Here, we studied the effects of polyethylene (PE) MPs on the photosynthetic performance of two maize cultivars Xianyu 335 (XY) and Zhengdan 958 (ZD) grown in a Cd contaminated soil. Results showed that the leaf Cd concentration in XY and ZD reached 26.1 and 31.9 μg g-1, respectively. PE-MPs did not influence the leaf Cd content, but posed direct and negative effects on photosynthesis by increasing the malondialdehyde content, reducing the chlorophyll content, inhibiting photosynthetic capacity, disrupting the PSII donor side, blocking electron transfer in different photosystems, and suppressing the oxidation and reduction states of PSI. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect of combined PE-MPs and Cd on maize photosynthesis was attributed to suppressed expression of the genes encoding PSII, PSI, F-type ATPase, cytochrome b6/f complex, and electron transport between PSII and PSI. Using WGCNA, we identified a MEturquoise module highly correlated with photosynthetic traits. Hub genes bridging carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and translation provided the molecular mechanisms of PE-MPs and Cd tolerance in maize plants. The comprehensive information on the phytotoxicity mechanisms of Cd stress in the presence or absence of PE-MPs on the photosynthesis of maize is helpful for cloning Cd and PE-MP resistance genes in the future.","Li Y., Feng H., Xian S., Wang J., Zheng X., Song X.",10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.108065,Plant Physiology And Biochemistry : Ppb
Enrichment Characteristics And Ecological Risk Prediction Of Pathogens On Typical Microplastic Biofilms,"As an emerging niche colonized by microorganisms, microplastics may selectively enrich pathogens, resulting in crucial ecological risks and potential threats to public health in aquatic environments. However, the enrichment characteristics and ecological risks of pathogens on different microplastic biofilms remain unclear. In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the differences in the bacterial community structure, occurrence characteristics of pathogens, and prediction of ecological risks on five typical microplastic biofilms of polyethylene （PE）, polypropylene （PP）, polystyrene （PS）, polyethylene terephthalate （PET）, and polyvinyl chloride （PVC） through a field in-situ incubation experiment. The results showed that after 28 d of in situ incubation, the macroscopic biofilms were formed on the surface of all microplastics, and the diversity and richness of the bacterial community on all microplastic biofilms were higher than in the surrounding water, indicating that the microorganisms in the surrounding water were selectively enriched on microplastics. Each type of microplastic biofilm had formed a unique bacterial community structure； in particular, PVC microplastics were more inclined to selectively enrich the members of Proteobacteria. A total of 47 human pathogens were identified using the HPB database, including six antibiotic resistance pathogens belonging to the lists of critical priority control. The number and total abundance of human pathogens detected on microplastic biofilm were higher than those in the surrounding water, and the dominant pathogens such as Bartonella, Burkholderia, and Brucella were selectively enriched on microplastic biofilms. Microbial phenotype prediction results based on BugBase showed that three functional phenotypes including biofilm formation, mobile element contained, and potentially pathogenic on microplastic biofilms had significantly increased by 2.38%-5.57%, 0.82%-7.13%, and 3.04%-8.30%, respectively, which were mainly contributed by α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria. These results not only indicate that the selective enrichment of opportunistic pathogens on microplastic biofilms may lead to the increased risk of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance co-spread but also provide reference for the accurate assessment of ecological risks caused by microplastic pollution in aquatic environments.","Wang F., Hu Z.-X., Wang W.-J., Xiao Y.-Y., Mai W.-C., Li G.-Y., An T.-C.",10.13227/j.hjkx.202311126,Huan Jing Ke Xue= Huanjing Kexue
Developing Targeted Therapies For Neuroblastoma By Dissecting The Effects Of Metabolic Reprogramming On Tumor Microenvironments And Progression,"Rationale: Synergic reprogramming of metabolic dominates neuroblastoma (NB) progression. It is of great clinical implications to develop an individualized risk prognostication approach with stratification-guided therapeutic options for NB based on elucidating molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming. Methods: With a machine learning-based multi-step program, the synergic mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming-driven malignant progression of NB were elucidated at single-cell and metabolite flux dimensions. Subsequently, a promising metabolic reprogramming-associated prognostic signature (MPS) and individualized therapeutic approaches based on MPS-stratification were developed and further validated independently using pre-clinical models. Results: MPS-identified MPS-I NB showed significantly higher activity of metabolic reprogramming than MPS-II counterparts. MPS demonstrated improved accuracy compared to current clinical characteristics [AUC: 0.915 vs. 0.657 (MYCN), 0.713 (INSS-stage), and 0.808 (INRG-stratification)] in predicting prognosis. AZD7762 and etoposide were identified as potent therapeutics against MPS-I and II NB, respectively. Subsequent biological tests revealed AZD7762 substantially inhibited growth, migration, and invasion of MPS-I NB cells, more effectively than that of MPS-II cells. Conversely, etoposide had better therapeutic effects on MPS-II NB cells. More encouragingly, AZD7762 and etoposide significantly inhibited in-vivo subcutaneous tumorigenesis, proliferation, and pulmonary metastasis in MPS-I and MPS-II samples, respectively; thereby prolonging survival of tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, AZD7762 and etoposide-induced apoptosis of the MPS-I and MPS-II cells, respectively, through mitochondria-dependent pathways; and MPS-I NB resisted etoposide-induced apoptosis by addiction of glutamate metabolism and acetyl coenzyme A. MPS-I NB progression was fueled by multiple metabolic reprogramming-driven factors including multidrug resistance, immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironments. Immunologically, MPS-I NB suppressed immune cells via MIF and THBS signaling pathways. Metabolically, the malignant proliferation of MPS-I NB cells was remarkably supported by reprogrammed glutamate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, urea cycle, etc. Furthermore, MPS-I NB cells manifested a distinct tumor-promoting developmental lineage and self-communication patterns, as evidenced by enhanced oncogenic signaling pathways activated with development and self-communications. Conclusions: This study provides deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming-mediated malignant progression of NB. It also sheds light on developing targeted medications guided by the novel precise risk prognostication approaches, which could contribute to a significantly improved therapeutic strategy for NB.","Jin W., Zhang Y., Zhao Z., Gao M.",10.7150/thno.93962,Theranostics
A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial To Assess Antibiotic Pocket Irrigation On Tissue Expander Breast Reconstruction,"Bacterial infection is the most common complication following staged post-mastectomy breast reconstruction initiated with a tissue expander (TE). To limit bacterial infection, antibiotic irrigation of the surgical site is commonly performed despite little high-quality data to support this practice. We performed a prospective randomized control trial to compare the impact of saline irrigation alone to a triple antibiotic irrigation regimen (1 g cefazolin, 80 mg gentamicin, and 50,000 units of bacitracin in 500 mL of saline) for breast implant surgery. The microbiome in breasts with cancer (n = 16) was compared to those without (n = 16), as all patients (n = 16) had unilateral cancers but bilateral mastectomies (n = 32). Biologic and prosthetic specimens procured both at the time of mastectomy and during TE removal months later were analyzed for longitudinal comparison. Outcomes included clinical infection, bacterial abundance, and relative microbiome composition. No patient in either group suffered a reconstructive failure or developed an infection. Triple antibiotic irrigation administered at the time of immediate TE reconstruction did not reduce bacterial abundance or impact microbial diversity relative to saline irrigation at the time of planned exchange. Implanted prosthetic material adopted the microbial composition of the surrounding host tissue. In cancer-naïve breasts, relative to saline, antibiotic irrigation increased bacterial abundance on periprosthetic capsules (P = 0.03) and acellular dermal matrices (P = 0.04) and altered the microbiota on both. These data show that, relative to saline only, the use of triple antibiotic irrigation in TE breast reconstruction does impact the bacterial abundance and diversity of certain biomaterials from cancer-naïve breasts. IMPORTANCE The lifetime risk of breast cancer is ~13% in women and is treated with a mastectomy in ~50% of cases. The majority are reconstructed, usually starting with a tissue expander to help restore the volume for a subsequent permanent breast implant or the women’s own tissues. The biopsychosocial benefits of breast reconstruction, though, can be tempered by a high complication rate of at least 7% but over 30% in some women. Bacterial infection is the most common complication, and can lead to treatment delays, patient physical and emotional distress and escalating health care cost. To limit this risk, plastic surgeons have tried a variety of strategies to limit bacterial infection including irrigating the pocket created after removing the breast implant with antibiotic solutions, but good-quality data are scarce. Herein, we study the value of antibiotics in pocket irrigation using a robust randomized clinical trial design and molecular microbiology approaches.","Walker J.N., Hanson B.M., Hunter T., Simar S.R., Duran Ramirez J.M., Obernuefemann C.L.P., Parikh R.P., Tenenbaum M.M., Margenthaler J.A., Hultgren S.J., Myckatyn T.M.",10.1128/spectrum.01430-23,Microbiology Spectrum
Combined Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibition Overcomes Mapk/Extracellular Signal–Regulated Kinase Kinase Inhibitor Resistance In Plexiform Neurofibroma Of Neurofibromatosis Type I,"MAPK/extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors (MEKis) have recently achieved surprising success in treating unresectable plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance in patients with PNF. We determined the efficacy of six different MEKis for treating PNFs, explored drug resistance mechanisms, and identified potential combination therapies to overcome resistance. By screening drug efficacy among six MEKis in human NF1-deficient PNF cell lines, TAK-733 was found to reduce PNF cell viability the most. We then cultured the TAK-733‒resistant cells and explored the potential targets for further treatment. Both high-throughput drug screening and RNA sequencing analyses of MEKi-resistant PNF cells identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as potential agents for PNFs. Dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, showed synergistic effects on MEKi-resistant cells. Coadministration of dinaciclib and TAK-733 significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited sphere formation and colony formation. Dinaciclib did not affect MEK signaling but decreased the expression of several prosurvival proteins, including survivin and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, to induce apoptosis and inhibit mitosis. TAK-733/dinaciclib combination therapy induced tumor reduction in PNF patient‒derived xenografts mouse models. Therefore, the combination of MEKi and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor may be promising for treating inoperable PNFs, especially when drug resistance exists. Our findings provide evidence for future clinical trials with MEKi-resistant patients with PNF.","Wang W., Cui X.-W., Gu Y.-H., Wei C.-J., Li Y.-H., Ren J.-Y., Chung M.-H., Aimaier R.-H.-H.-H., Zhang H.-B., Li Q.-F., Wang Z.-C.",10.1016/j.jid.2021.07.164,Journal Of Investigative Dermatology
Genome-Wide Dna Methylome Analysis Identifies Methylation Signatures Associated With Survival And Drug Resistance Of Ovarian Cancers,"Background: In contrast to stable genetic events, epigenetic changes are highly plastic and play crucial roles in tumor evolution and development. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly heterogeneous disease that is generally associated with poor prognosis and treatment failure. Profiling epigenome-wide DNA methylation status is therefore essential to better characterize the impact of epigenetic alterations on the heterogeneity of EOC. Methods: An epigenome-wide association study was conducted to evaluate global DNA methylation in a retrospective cohort of 80 mixed subtypes of primary ovarian cancers and 30 patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Three demethylating agents, azacytidine, decitabine, and thioguanine, were tested their anti-cancer and anti-chemoresistant effects on HGSOC cells. Results: Global DNA hypermethylation was significantly associated with high-grade tumors, platinum resistance, and poor prognosis. We determined that 9313 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were enriched in their relative gene regions of 4938 genes involved in small GTPases and were significantly correlated with the PI3K-AKT, MAPK, RAS, and WNT oncogenic pathways. On the other hand, global DNA hypermethylation was preferentially associated with recurrent HGSOC. A total of 2969 DMPs corresponding to 1471 genes were involved in olfactory transduction, and calcium and cAMP signaling. Co-treatment with demethylating agents showed significant growth retardation in ovarian cancer cells through differential inductions, such as cell apoptosis by azacytidine or G2/M cell cycle arrest by decitabine and thioguanine. Notably, azacytidine and decitabine, though not thioguanine, synergistically enhanced cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity in HGSOC cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the significant association of global hypermethylation with poor prognosis and drug resistance in high-grade EOC and highlights the potential of demethylating agents in cancer treatment.

Differential Genetic Responses To The Stress Revealed The Mutation-Order Adaptive Divergence Between Two Sympatric Ginger Species,"Background: Divergent genetic responses to the same environmental pressures may lead sympatric ecological speciation possible. Such speciation process possibly explains rapid sympatric speciation of island species. Two island endemic ginger species Zingiber kawagoii and Z. shuanglongensis was suggested to be independently originated from inland ancestors, but their island endemism and similar morphologies and habitats lead another hypothesis of in situ ecological speciation. For understanding when and how these two species diverged, intraspecific variation was estimated from three chloroplast DNA fragments (cpDNA) and interspecific genome-wide SNPs and expression differences after saline treatment were examined by transcriptomic analyses. Results: Extremely low intraspecific genetic variation was estimated by cpDNA sequences in both species: nucleotide diversity π = 0.00002 in Z. kawagoii and no nucleotide substitution but only indels found in Z. shuanglongensis. Nonsignificant inter-population genetic differentiation suggests homogenized genetic variation within species. Based on 53,683 SNPs from 13,842 polymorphic transcripts, in which 10,693 SNPs are fixed between species, Z. kawagoii and Z. shuanglongensis were estimated to be diverged since 218~ 238 thousand generations ago (complete divergence since 41.5~ 43.5 thousand generations ago). This time is more recent than the time of Taiwan Island formation. In addition, high proportion of differential expression genes (DEGs) is non-polymorphic or non-positively selected, suggesting key roles of plastic genetic divergence in broaden the selectability in incipient speciation. While some positive selected DEGs were mainly the biotic and abiotic stress-resistance genes, emphasizing the importance of adaptive divergence of stress-related genes in sympatric ecological speciation. Furthermore, the higher proportional expression of functional classes in Z. kawagoii than in Z. shuanglongensis explains the more widespread distribution of Z. kawagoii in Taiwan. Conclusions: Our results contradict the previous hypothesis of independent origination of these two island endemic ginger species from SE China and SW China. Adaptive divergent responses to the stress explain how these gingers maintain genetic differentiation in sympatry. However, the recent speciation and rapid expansion make extremely low intraspecific genetic variation in these two species. This study arise a more probable speciation hypothesis of sympatric speciation within an island via the mutation-order mechanism underlying the same environmental pressure.","Huang B.-H., Lin Y.-C., Huang C.-W., Lu H.-P., Luo M.-X., Liao P.-C.",10.1186/s12864-018-5081-3,Bmc Genomics
A Ph-Triggered N-Oxide Polyzwitterionic Nano-Drug Loaded System For The Anti-Tumor Immunity Activation Research,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the characteristics of low immune cell infiltration, high expression of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and abundant cancer stem cells. Systemic toxicity of traditional chemotherapy drugs due to poor drug selectivity, and chemotherapy failure due to tumor drug resistance and other problems, so it is particularly important to find new cancer treatment strategies for TNBC with limited treatment options. Both the anti-tumor natural drugs curcumin and ginsenoside Rg3 can exert anti-tumor effects by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells, reducing PD-L1 expression, and reducing cancer stem cells. However, they have the disadvantages of poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and weak anti-tumor effect of single agents. We used vinyl ether bonds to link curcumin (Cur) with N-O type zwitterionic polymers and at the same time encapsulated ginsenoside Rg3 to obtain hyperbranched zwitterionic drug-loaded micelles OPDEA-PGED-5HA@Cur@Rg3 (PPH@CR) with pH response. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments have proved that PPH@CR could not only promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and increase the CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells by inducing ICD in tumor cells but also reduce the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues, and reduce cancer stem cells and showed better anti-tumor effects and good biological safety compared with free double drugs, which is a promising cancer treatment strategy.","Zhao Y., Bai Y., Li M., Nie X., Meng H., Shosei S., Liu L., Yang Q., Shen M., Li Y.",10.1186/s12951-024-02677-0,Journal Of Nanobiotechnology
Stromal Cells In The Tumor Microenvironment: Accomplices Of Tumor Progression?,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is made up of cells and extracellular matrix (non-cellular component), and cellular components include cancer cells and non-malignant cells such as immune cells and stromal cells. These three types of cells establish complex signals in the body and further influence tumor genesis, development, metastasis and participate in resistance to anti-tumor therapy. It has attracted scholars to study immune cells in TME due to the significant efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) in solid tumors and hematologic tumors. After more than 10 years of efforts, the role of immune cells in TME and the strategy of treating tumors based on immune cells have developed rapidly. Moreover, ICI have been recommended by guidelines as first- or second-line treatment strategies in a variety of tumors. At the same time, stromal cells is another major class of cellular components in TME, which also play a very important role in tumor metabolism, growth, metastasis, immune evasion and treatment resistance. Stromal cells can be recruited from neighboring non-cancerous host stromal cells and can also be formed by transdifferentiation from stromal cells to stromal cells or from tumor cells to stromal cells. Moreover, they participate in tumor genesis, development and drug resistance by secreting various factors and exosomes, participating in tumor angiogenesis and tumor metabolism, regulating the immune response in TME and extracellular matrix. However, with the deepening understanding of stromal cells, people found that stromal cells not only have the effect of promoting tumor but also can inhibit tumor in some cases. In this review, we will introduce the origin of stromal cells in TME as well as the role and specific mechanism of stromal cells in tumorigenesis and tumor development and strategies for treatment of tumors based on stromal cells. We will focus on tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), tumor-associated adipocytes (CAAs), tumor endothelial cells (TECs) and pericytes (PCs) in stromal cells.","Zhao Y., Shen M., Wu L., Yang H., Yao Y., Yang Q., Du J., Liu L., Li Y., Bai Y.",10.1038/s41419-023-06110-6,Cell Death And Disease
High Bisphenol A Concentrations Augment The Invasiveness Of Tumor Cells Through Snail-1/Cx43/Errγ-Dependent Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly present in plastics used for food storage and preservation. The release of BPA from these products results in a permanent human exposition to BPA; however, the quality and quantity of BPA adverse effects remain a matter of controversy. The common presence of BPA in the human environment and the controversies concerning the relations of human exposition to BPA and cancer incidence justify the research on the interactions between BPA and pro-metastatic signaling in cancer cells. Here, we describe a novel BPA-reactive signaling axis that induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. BPA exerted negligible effects on their properties in a wide range of concentrations (10 nM - 100 nM), whereas it considerably induced A549 invasiveness at high concentrations (10 μM). The BPA-induced EMT was illustrated by morphologic changes, E/N-cadherin switch and vimentin/Snail-1/connexin(Cx)43 up-regulation in A549 populations. It was followed by enhancement of A549 drug-resistance. Corresponding effects of BPA were observed in prostate cancer cell populations. Concomitantly, we observed increased levels and perinuclear accumulation of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) in BPA-treated cells, its interactions with Cx43/Snail-1, and the corresponding effects of phenol red on A549 cells. Collectively, these data identify a novel, pro-metastatic Snail-1/Cx43/ERRγ signaling pathway. Its reactivity to BPA underlies the induction of cancer cells' invasiveness in the presence of high BPA concentrations in vitro. Thus, the chronic exposition of cancer cells to extrinsic and intrinsic BPA should be considered as a potential obstacle in a cancer therapy.","Ryszawy D., Pudełek M., Kochanowski P., Janik-Olchawa N., Bogusz J., Rąpała M., Koczurkiewicz P., Mikołajczyk J., Borek I., Kędracka-Krok S., Karnas E., Zuba-Surma E., Madeja Z., Czyż J.",10.1016/j.tiv.2019.104676,Toxicology In Vitro
Avoiding The Removal Of Syndesmotic Screws After Distal Tibiofibular Diastasis Repair: A Benefit Or A Drawback?,"There is still no general agreement about the most effective form of syndesmosis fixation with syndesmotic screws for patients affected by ankle fractures that are accompanied by syndesmotic injuries. In the same manner, no consensus has been reached yet on whether or not the tibiofibular syndesmotic screw is more beneficial if removed or not, as well as the exact timing of removal if this proves superiority. The purpose of this research was to verify whether or not removing syndesmotic screws reduces the risk of developing a diastasis and compare outcomes in patients whose syndesmotic screw was or was not removed at all. A retrospective observational study was carried out to cover a period of five years and a computed sample size of almost 300 cases. Patients were included in the current study if their history was positive for ankle fracture with distal tibiofibular diastasis repair with syndesmotic screws. Loss of reduction was more frequent after screw removal (8.5% vs. 2.1%), although the quality of reduction was generally excellent in both groups. The mean AOFAS score was significantly better in patients who had their tibiofibular screw removed (92.6 vs. 88.4), but the tibiofibular clear space and incisura fibularis depth widened more following the second intervention (3.8 mm vs. 3.6 mm, and, respectively, 4.3 vs. 4.1). Lastly, the same patients with tibiofibular screw removal had a significantly higher cost of total interventions and more days of medical leave (21 vs. 15 days on average). It seems that a strong conclusion in favor of removing or not removing syndesmotic screws after distal tibiofibular diastasis repair cannot be given. However, several radiographic findings lean toward the benefit of those patients whose tibiofibular screws were not removed, although mobility was notably better after the screw was removed. Furthermore, treatment expenses are greatly lowered if a subsequent operation for screw removal is avoided, as well as if individuals who have a single surgery take a shorter medical leave.","Hosin S., Vermesan D., Prejbeanu R., Crisan D., Al-Qatawneh M., Pop D., Mioc M., Bratosin F., Feciche B., Hemaswini K., Moise M.L., Dumitru C., Bloanca V., Pilut C.N.",10.3390/jcm11216412,Journal Of Clinical Medicine
Relapse Of Covid-19-Associated Mucormycosis In Patients Receiving Posaconazole As Maintenance Treatment,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with secondary fungal infections such as mucormycosis. We investigated the relapse rate of mucormycosis and its risk factors. Methodology: A prospective study was conducted on COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) patients discharged from Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran, from July 2021 to February 2022. Patients who received posaconazole as a step-down therapy were included and examined monthly for six months. A relapsing mucormycosis case was defined as a patient with new clinical or radiological symptoms, confirmed by observing aseptate hyphae in the histopathological examination or tissue culture. The characteristics of patients with and without relapse were analyzed and compared. Results: Seventy-seven patients completed the six-month follow-up after discharge. Most patients were male (n = 46, 59.8%), with a mean age of 53.1 years (median 19-84). The most common underlying diseases were diabetes (52/77, 67.5%), hypertension (33/77, 42.8%), and cancer/chemotherapy (25/77, 32.4%). Seven patients (7/77, 9%) were reported as relapsing cases. There was no difference in demographic features and underlying diseases between the groups. A significant difference was seen in the mean duration of posaconazole consumption between patients with and without relapse (24 ± 4.4 days vs. 49.4 ± 4.3 days, respectively, p = 0.015). The primary orbital involvement was also significantly associated with relapse (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Our findings showed a significant relapse of CAM (9%). A longer duration of posaconazole consumption and completion of treatment for initial orbital involvement in CAM patients are recommended for better patient management and prevention of relapse.","Salehi M., Khodavaisy S., Sarvestani H.K., Sobati A., Pakdel F., Fard E.S., Darvishi M., Shavandi M., Mussini C., Rafat Z., Ahmadikia K., Tabari A.",10.3855/jidc.19645,Journal Of Infection In Developing Countries
Leech Management Before Application On Patient: A Nationwide Survey Of Practices In French University Hospitals,"Background: Leech therapy in plastic/reconstructive microsurgery significantly improves a successful outcome of flap salvage but the drawback is a risk of severe infection that results in a drop of the salvage rates from 70-80% to below 30%. We report the results of a national survey conducted in all the French university hospitals to assess the current extent of use of leech for medical practices in the hospital and to investigate maintenance, delivery practices and prevention of the risk of infection. Methods: Data concerning conditions of storage, leech external decontamination, microbiological controls, mode of delivery and antibiotic prophylaxis were collected from all the French university hospitals in practicing leech therapy, on the basis of a standardized questionnaire. Results: Twenty-eight of the 32 centers contacted filled the questionnaire, among which 23 practiced leech therapy, mostly with a centralized storage in the pharmacy; 39.1% of the centers declared to perform leech external decontamination and only 2 centers recurrent microbiological controls of the water storage. Leech delivery was mostly nominally performed (56.5%), but traceability of the leech batch number was achieved in only 39.1% of the cases. Only 5 centers declared that a protocol of antibiotic prophylaxis was systematically administered during leech therapy: either quinolone (2), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (2) or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1). Conclusions: Measures to prevent infectious complications before application to patient have to be better applied and guidelines of good practices are necessary.","Grau D., Masson R., Villiet M., Lamy B., Pelloquin N., Fagnoni C., Venet A., Safrano L., Hecquard C., Prudent C., Dunoyer G., Nouvel M., Bornet C., Rondelot G., Giesenfeld A., Césari J., Huon J.-F., Soulairol I., Bonnet M., Grasset L., Desplechain M., Bauer S., Ratsimbazafy V., Arfeuille M., Coquard A., Paya D., Sautou V., Lieutier F., Hermelin I., Tatem L., Gicquel V., Merger D.",10.1186/s13756-018-0311-7,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
A State Of Stochastic Cancer Stemness Through The Cdk1-Sox2 Axis,"The concept of cancer stemness has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decade where there is wider acceptance of the idea that stemness in cancer is a more dynamic and plastic phenomenon than previously thought. However, we have yet to understand the mechanisms on how this stochastic plasticity arises and is maintained. Recently, we have shown that CDK1 plays a critical role in stochastic stemness and tumor initiation potential through regulating SOX2 phosphorylation in multiple cancer types. The phosphorylation of SOX2 affects its nuclear localization, thereby determining the transcriptional fate of its downstream targets. We have also validated the significance of these findings using clinical samples by demonstrating that CDK1high tumor samples displayed upregulation of MYC target genes, which were reported to overlap with SOX2 targets. In the current article, we further discuss the possibility of a closed, feed-forward loop between SOX2 and CDK1 through a long non-coding RNA, CCAT1, which would explain the sustained activation of this loop. Despite the extensive investigation of the cancer stemness as a cause of drug resistance, its role in immune evasion still requires further understanding, and hence, in this article, we further discuss the possibility of this CDK1-SOX2 axis contributing to immune resistance through modulating cell-to-cell interaction directly or indirectly in the tumor microenvironment.","Menon D.R., Fujita M.",10.18632/oncotarget.26819,Oncotarget
Glucocorticoid Resistance Of Migration And Gene Expression In A Daughter Mda-Mb-231 Breast Tumour Cell Line Selected For High Metastatic Potential,"Glucocorticoids are commonly used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting despite a lack of understanding of their direct effect on cancer progression. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids inhibit cancer cell migration. However, this action has not been investigated in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumour cells, although activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is associated with a worse prognosis in ER-negative breast cancers. In this study we have explored the effect of glucocorticoids on the migration of the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast tumour cell line and the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231-HM.LNm5 cell line that was generated through in vivo cycling. We show for the first time that glucocorticoids inhibit 2- and 3-dimensional migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Selection of cells for high metastatic potential resulted in a less migratory cell phenotype that was resistant to regulation by glucocorticoids and showed decreased GR receptor expression. The emergence of glucocorticoid resistance during metastatic selection may partly explain the apparent disparity between the clinical and in vitro evidence regarding the actions of glucocorticoids in cancer. These findings highlight the highly plastic nature of tumour cells, and underscore the need to more fully understand the direct effect of glucocorticoid treatment on different stages of metastatic progression.","Fietz E.R., Keenan C.R., López-Campos G., Tu Y., Johnstone C.N., Harris T., Stewart A.G.",10.1038/srep43774,Scientific Reports
Conformational Plasticity Of The Nnrti-Binding Pocket In Hiv-1 Reverse Transcriptase: A Fluorine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study,"HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a major drug target in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. RT inhibitors currently in use include non-nucleoside, allosteric RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), which bind to a hydrophobic pocket, distinct from the enzyme's active site. We investigated RT-NNRTI interactions by solution (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), using singly (19)F-labeled RT proteins. Comparison of (19)F chemical shifts of fluorinated RT and drug-resistant variants revealed that the fluorine resonance is a sensitive probe for identifying mutation-induced changes in the enzyme. Our data show that in the unliganded enzyme, the NNRTI-binding pocket is highly plastic and not locked into a single conformation. Upon inhibitor binding, the binding pocket becomes rigidified. In the inhibitor-bound state, the (19)F signal of RT is similar to that of drug-resistant mutant enzymes, distinct from what is observed for the free state. Our results demonstrate the power of (19)F NMR spectroscopy to characterize conformational properties using selectively (19)F-labeled protein.","Sharaf N.G., Ishima R., Gronenborn A.M.",10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00113,Biochemistry
An Immune-Regulating Polysaccharide Hybrid Hydrogel With Mild Photothermal Effect And Anti-Inflammatory For Accelerating Infected Wound Healing,"Bacterial infections and excessive inflammation present substantial challenges for clinical wound healing. Hydrogels with mild photothermal (PTT) effects have emerged as promising agents owing to their dual actions: positive effects on cells and negative effects on bacteria. Here, an injectable self-healing hydrogel of oxidized konjac glucomannan/arginine-modified chitosan (OKGM/CS-Arg, OC) integrated with protocatechualdehyde-@Fe (PF) nanoparticles capable of effectively absorbing near-infrared radiation is synthesized successfully. The OC/PF hydrogels exhibit excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and antioxidant activity. Moreover, in synergy with PTT, OC/PF demonstrates potent antibacterial effects while concurrently stimulating cell migration and new blood vessel formation. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-infected full-thickness mouse wounds, the OC/PF hydrogel displays remarkable antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, and accelerates wound healing by regulating the wound immune microenvironment and promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Consequently, the OC/PF hydrogel represents a novel therapeutic approach for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and offers a technologically advanced solution for managing infectious wounds in clinical settings.","Zhou S., Zhang X., Ni W., He Y., Li M., Wang C., Bai Y., Zhang H., Yao M.",10.1002/adhm.202400003,Advanced Healthcare Materials
Structure And Activities Of The Ns1 Influenza Protein And Progress In The Development Of Small-Molecule Drugs,"The influenza virus causes human disease on a global scale and significant morbidity and mortality. The existing vaccination regime remains vulnerable to antigenic drift, and more seriously, a small number of viral mutations could lead to drug resistance. Therefore, the development of a new additional therapeutic small molecule-based anti-influenza virus is urgently required. The NS1 influenza gene plays a pivotal role in the suppression of host antiviral responses, especially by inhibiting interferon (IFN) production and the activities of antiviral proteins, such as dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase R (PKR) and 2(′)-5(′)-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L. NS1 also modulates important aspects of viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus replication cycle. Taken together, small molecules that target NS1 are believed to offer a means of developing new anti-influenza drugs.","Kim H., Jeong M., Jang S.",10.3390/ijms22084242,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
"Intellixmark: A Solution For Reliable, Durable And Long-Lasting Tracking Information Directly On Sample Tubes","Problem: Further to a 2D barcode, a linear barcode and a human readable number (HRN) certain biobank workflows demand supplementary tracking information on sample tubes. Adding this supplementary tracking information by hand costs time and is not entirely reliable. To date, adding printed labels has offered inconsistent results including labels falling off the tubes. Proposed Solution: The IntelliXmark is designed to directly print text, linear barcodes, 2D codes and graphics onto plastic sample tubes, substituting the need for labels or marker pens which can be less reliable.-Print directly on the surface of tubes from 0.2 ml to 50 ml-Labels or stickers are not required-Clearer and more durable marking compared to marker pen-Consistently legible text and barcodes at high resolutions-Resistant to alcohol, water, liquid nitrogen and mechanical abrasion-Long lasting sample identification at competitive “per mark” cost. Conclusion: With IntelliXmark there is no longer a need to use labels or marker pens. Marking is resistant to ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, DMSO∗, pure haematoxylin, water, liquid nitrogen and mechanical abrasion. The prints are also stable over a wide temperature range (-196°C to 100°C). Markings do not transfer when touching the tubes. Several lines of text can be printed, for example sample name, sampling site, your name, date, time etc. Printing straight to the tube surface is much easier, more reliable and faster than marking by hand.",Thurogood M.,10.1089/bio.2018.29035.abstracts,Biopreservation And Biobanking
Targeted Delivery Of Fat Extract By Platelet Membrane-Cloaked Nanocarriers For The Treatment Of Ischemic Stroke,"Background: Our previous studies suggest that human fat extract (FE) contains a variety of angiogenic factors and may provide an alternative treatment option for stroke. However, the therapeutic effect is largely limited due to its short half-life, and inaccurate targeting. Results: Herein, we leverage the targeting abilities of platelets (PLTs) to the lesion area of stroke and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides to the angiogenic blood vessels to develop a biomimetic nanocarrier that capable of delivering FE precisely to treat stroke. The biomimetic nanocarriers are comprised of FE-encapsulated PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) core enclosed by RGD peptides decorated plasma membrane of PLTs, namely RGD-PLT@PLGA-FE. We found that RGD-PLT@PLGA-FE not only targeted damaged and inflamed blood vessels but also achieved rapid accumulation in the lesion area of ischemic brain. In addition, RGD-PLT@PLGA-FE kept a sustained release behavior of FE at the lesion site, effectively increased its half-life and promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis with delivering neurotrophic factors including BDNF, GDNF and bFGF to the brain, that ultimately resulted in blood flow increase and neurobehavioral recovery. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study provides a new strategy to design a biomimetic system for FE delivery and it is a promising modality for stroke therapy.

"Subcutaneously Engineered Decalcified Bone Matrix Xenografts Promote Bone Repair By Regulating The Immune Microenvironment, Prevascularization, And Stem Cell Homing","Immunoregulatory and vascularized microenvironments play an important role in bone regeneration; however, the precise regulation for vascularization and inflammatory reactions remains elusive during bone repair. In this study, by means of subcutaneous preimplantation, we successfully constructed demineralized bone matrix (DBM) grafts with immunoregulatory and vascularized microenvironments. According to the current results, at the early time points (days 1 and 3), subcutaneously implanted DBM grafts recruited a large number of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages with positive expression of CD68 and iNOS, while at the later time points (days 7 and 14), these inflammatory cells gradually subsided, accompanying increased presence of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages with positive expression of CD206 and Arg-1, indicating a gradually enhanced anti-inflammatory microenvironment. At the same time, the gradually increased angiogenesis was observed in the DBM grafts with implantation time. In addition, the positive cells of CD105, CD73, and CD90 were observed in the inner region of the DBM grafts, implying the homing of mesenchymal stem cells. The repair results of cranial bone defects in a rat model further confirmed that the subcutaneous DBM xenografts at 7 days significantly improved bone regeneration. In summary, we developed a simple and novel strategy for bone regeneration mediated by anti-inflammatory microenvironment, prevascularization, and endogenous stem cell homing.","Pan Q., Zhang P., Xue F., Zhang J., Fan Z., Chang Z., Liang Z., Zhou G., Ren W.",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.3c01331,Acs Biomaterials Science And Engineering
Single-Cell Rna Sequencing Analysis Reveals The Role Of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts In Skin Melanoma,"Aims: Mechanism of fibroblasts in skin melanoma (SKME) revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing data. Background: SKME is responsible for more than 80% of skin-related cancer deaths. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generate inflammatory factors, growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins to facilitate cancer cell growth, metastasis, drug resistance and immune exclusion. Howev-er, molecular mechanisms of CAFs in SKME are still lacking. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the role of CAFs in SKME. Methods: We downloaded the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE215120) database. Then, the Seurat package was applied to analyze the single-cell atlas of SKME data, and cell subsets were annotated with the CellMarker database. The molecular mechanisms of CAFs in SKME were disclosed via differential gene expression and enrichment analysis, Cellchat and SCENIC methods. Results: Using scRNA-seq data, three SKME cases were used and downscaled and clustered to identify 11 cell subgroups and 5 CAF subsets. The enrichment of highly expressed genes among the 5 CAF subsets suggests that cell migration-inducing hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP)(+) fibroblasts and naked cuticle homolog 1 (NKD1)(+) fibroblasts were closely associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Cellchat analysis revealed that CAF subpopulations promoted melanocyte proliferation through Jagged1 (JAG1)-Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), JAG1-NOTCH3 and migration through pleiotrophin (PTN)-syndecan-3 (SDC3) receptor-ligand pairs. The SCENIC analysis identified that most of the transcription factors in each CAF subpopulation played a certain role in the metastasis of melanoma and were highly expressed in metastatic SKME samples. Specifically, we observed that CEMIP(+) fibroblasts and NKD1(+) fibroblasts had potential roles in participating in immune therapy resistance. Collectively, we uncovered a single--cell atlas of SKME and revealed the molecular mechanisms of CAFs in SKME development, providing a base for immune therapy and prognosis assessment. Conclusion: Our study reveals that 5 CAFs in SKME have a promoting effect on melanocyte proliferation and metastasis. More importantly, CEMIP(+) fibroblasts and NKD1(+) fibroblasts displayed close connections with immune therapy resistance. These findings help provide a good basis for future immune therapy and prognosis assessment targeting CAFs in SKME.","Lian W., Xiang P., Ye C., Xiong J.",10.2174/0109298673282799231211113347,Current Medicinal Chemistry
Modulating Cancer-Stroma Crosstalk By A Nanoparticle-Based Photodynamic Method To Pave The Way For Subsequent Therapies,"Cancer cells and their stromal microenvironment are mutually supportive. Either destroying cancer cells or damaging stromal components cannot guarantee a satisfactory outcome in the long-term treatment. Herein, we showed that the tumor-stroma crosstalk was disturbed by nanoparticle-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) in pancreatic tumor models, leading to the persistent inhibition of extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and the enhanced therapeutic effect. By employing a conditioned medium method, we found that the nanoparticulate PDT at a sub-lethal dosage down-regulated TGFβ signaling pathways, leading to the decrease in drug resistance, proliferation, and migration of the cancer cells. Meanwhile, pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) were inactivated by PDT, hindering the secretion of ECM. Combining the results that PDT indiscriminately killed PSCs and cancer cells, we showed that the mutual support between the cancer cells and the stroma was interrupted. We further presented the inhibition of the crosstalk persistently enhanced tumor penetration in stroma-rich pancreatic tumor models. The loosened stroma not only facilitated tumor eradication by subsequent therapy but also improved the efficiency of gemcitabine treatment on monthly later recurrent tumors. Therefore, our work may boost the potential of PDT to be a valuable individual or adjuvant treatment for desmoplastic cancers.","Liu Y., Wu X., Chen F., Li H., Wang T., Liu N., Sun K., Zhou G., Tao K.",10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121813,Biomaterials
"""Combo"" Nanomedicine: Co-Delivery Of Multi-Modal Therapeutics For Efficient, Targeted, And Safe Cancer Therapy","The dynamic and versatile nature of diseases such as cancer has been a pivotal challenge for developing efficient and safe therapies. Cancer treatments using a single therapeutic agent often result in limited clinical outcomes due to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. Combination therapies using multiple therapeutic modalities can synergistically elevate anti-cancer activity while lowering doses of each agent, hence, reducing side effects. Co-administration of multiple therapeutic agents requires a delivery platform that can normalize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agents, prolong circulation, selectively accumulate, specifically bind to the target, and enable controlled release in target site. Nanomaterials, such as polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles/cages/shells, and carbon nanomaterials, have the desired properties, and they can mediate therapeutic effects different from those generated by small molecule drugs (e.g., gene therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy). This review aims to provide an overview of developing multi-modal therapies using nanomaterials (""combo"" nanomedicine) along with the rationale, up-to-date progress, further considerations, and the crucial roles of interdisciplinary approaches.","Kemp J.A., Shim M.S., Heo C.Y., Kwon Y.J.",10.1016/j.addr.2015.10.019,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews
A Live Single-Cell Reporter System Reveals Drug-Induced Plasticity Of A Cancer Stem Cell-Like Population In Cholangiocarcinoma,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) play an important role in carcinogenesis and are acknowledged to be responsible for chemoresistance in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Studying CCA CSC has been challenging, due to lack of consensus CSC markers, and to their plastic nature. Since dual expression of the core pluripotent factors SOX2/OCT4 has been shown to correlate with poor outcome in CCA patients, we selected the SOX2/OCT4 activating short half-life GFP-based live reporter (SORE6-dsCopGFP) to study CSC dynamics at the single-cell level. Transduction of five human CCA cell lines resulted in the expression of 1.8-13.1% GFP-positive (SORE6POS) cells. By live imaging, we found that SORE6POS CCA cells possess self-renewal capacity and that they can be induced to differentiate. Significantly, the SORE6POS cells were highly tumorigenic, both in vitro and in vivo, thus implicating the characteristics of primary CSCs. When we then analyzed for selected CSC-related markers, we found that the majority of both CD133+/CD44+, and CD133+/LGR5+ CCA cells were SORE6POS cells. Exposing transduced cells to standard CCA chemotherapy revealed higher growth rate inhibition at 50% (GR50s) for SORE6POS cells compared to GFP-negative (SORE6NEG) ones indicating that these CSC-like cells were more resistant to the treatment. Moreover, the chemotherapy induced SORE6POS from SORE6NEG cells, while retaining the existing SORE6POS population. Finally, treatment of transduced cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro for 3 days resulted in a lowered CSC number in the culture. Thus, applying a live reporter system allowed us to elucidate the stem cell diversity and drug-induced plasticity of CCA CSCs. These findings have clear implications for future management of such patients.","Kongtanawanich K., Prasopporn S., Jamnongsong S., Thongsin N., Payungwong T., Okada S., Hokland M., Wattanapanitch M., Jirawatnotai S.",10.1038/s41598-024-73581-8,Scientific Reports
Oxaliplatin Resistance Is Enhanced By Saracatinib Via Upregulation Wnt-Abcg1 Signaling In Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Background: Chemo-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major problem, and acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving complete responses. Molecular targeting therapy presents an opportunity to impede tumor through combination or sequential therapy, while the accurate effect is vague. Methods: The efficacy of combinations between oxaliplatin and anti-cancer molecular targeting drugs was screened. Strangely, the combined chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and saracatinib induced significantly antagonistic effects. Then the antitumor effects of combined treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin were confirmed in wide type HCC as well as in saracatinib- A nd oxaliplatin-resistant HCC. RNA sequencing was used to explore the resistance mechanism, and the roles of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) and Wnt signaling in oxaliplatin resistance were confirmed. Results: Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and saracatinib individually induced strong anti-HCC effects, while combined or sequential treatment of HCC cells with these two drugs exhibited reduced efficacy compared to treatment with the single drugs. And it was saracatinib treatment caused oxaliplatin resistance. RNA sequencing revealed 458 genes that were altered by treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin. Of these, the gene encoding ABCG1 and Wnt-associated genes were significantly upregulated. Upregulation of ABCG1 and oxaliplatin resistance were associated with activation of Wnt signaling. Interference with ABCG1 expression or inhibition of Wnt signaling resulted in reversal of the saracatinib-induced oxaliplatin resistance in HCC. Conclusions: These studies demonstrated that combined or sequential chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and saracatinib reduced antitumor efficacy, and this antagonism was attributed to the activation of Wnt signaling and upregulation of ABCG1 by saracatinib.","Liao X., Song G., Xu Z., Bu Y., Chang F., Jia F., Xiao X., Ren X., Zhang M., Jia Q.",10.1186/s12885-019-6480-9,Bmc Cancer
The Role Of Caspase-1/Gsdmd-Mediated Pyroptosis In Taxol-Induced Cell Death And A Taxol-Resistant Phenotype In Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Regulated By Autophagy,"Taxol has been widely used as a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, acquired drug resistance has caused great difficulties in clinical treatment. Pyroptosis is a newly discovered programmed cell death pathway, and Caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) play key roles in driving canonical pyroptosis. Increasing evidence suggests that pyroptosis is associated with the development of cancer; however, the function and mechanism of pyroptosis in NPC remain obscure. In this study, we observed that Taxol treatment caused pyroptotic cell death, along with activation of Caspase-1 and maturation of IL-1β, as well as cleavage of GSDMD, which is the canonical pyroptosis executor. Furthermore, Taxol-induced pyroptotic cell death could be suppressed by Caspase-1 inhibitor (Z-YVAD-FMK) and GSDMD knockout. Moreover, NPC parental cells demonstrated higher levels of pyroptosis than Taxol-resistant cells, and pyroptosis mediated by Caspase-1/GSDMD suppression induced by a Caspase-1 inhibitor and GSDMD knockout could induce a Taxol-resistant phenotype in vitro and in vivo. By transfecting an siRNA targeting Beclin-1 into NPC Taxol-resistant cells, we discovered that autophagy could negatively regulate pyroptosis by inhibiting Caspase-1/GSDMD activation.

Osteomyelitis Is Associated With Increased Anti-Inflammatory Response And Immune Exhaustion,"Introduction: Osteomyelitis (OMS) is a bone infection causing bone pain and severe complications. A balanced immune response is critical to eradicate infection without harming the host, yet pathogens manipulate immunity to establish a chronic infection. Understanding OMS-driven inflammation is essential for disease management, but comprehensive data on immune profiles and immune cell activation during OMS are lacking. Methods: Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, we investigated the detailed innate and adaptive systemic immune cell populations in OMS and age- and sex-matched controls. Results: Our study revealed that OMS is associated with increased levels of immune regulatory cells, namely T regulatory cells, B regulatory cells, and T follicular regulatory cells. In addition, the expression of immune activation markers HLA-DR and CD86 was decreased in OMS, while the expression of immune exhaustion markers TIM-3, PD-1, PD-L1, and VISTA was increased. Members of the T follicular helper (Tfh) cell family as well as classical and typical memory B cells were significantly increased in OMS individuals. We also found a strong correlation between memory B cells and Tfh cells. Discussion: We conclude that OMS skews the host immune system towards the immunomodulatory arm and that the Tfh memory B cell axis is evident in OMS. Therefore, immune-directed therapies may be a promising alternative for eradication and recurrence of infection in OMS, particularly in individuals and areas where antibiotic resistance is a major concern.","Surendar J., Hackenberg R.K., Schmitt-Sánchez F., Ossendorff R., Welle K., Stoffel-Wagner B., Sage P.T., Burger C., Wirtz D.C., Strauss A.C., Schildberg F.A.",10.3389/fimmu.2024.1396592,Frontiers In Immunology
Mechanistic Concepts Involved In Biofilm Associated Processes Of Campylobacter Jejuni: Persistence And Inhibition In Poultry Environments,"Campylobacter species, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, remains a significant zoonotic pathogen worldwide, with the poultry sector being the primary vector for human transmission. In recent years. there has been a notable rise in the incidence of human campylobacteriosis, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen's survival mechanisms and transmission dynamics. Biofilm presence significantly contributes to C. jejuni persistence in poultry and subsequent food product contamination, and this review describes the intricate processes involved in biofilm formation. The ability of Campylobacter to form biofilms on various surfaces, including stainless steel, plastic, and glass, is a critical survival strategy. Campylobacter biofilms, with their remarkable resilience, protect the pathogen from environmental stresses such as desiccation, pH extremes, biocides and sanitizing agents. This review explores the molecular and genetic mechanisms of C. jejuni biofilm formation, highlighting regulatory genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, and stress responses. Flagellar proteins, particularly flaA, flaB, flaG, and adhesins like cadF and flpA, are identified as the main molecular components in biofilm development. The role of mixed-species biofilms, where C. jejuni integrates into existing biofilms of other bacteria to enhance pathogen resilience, is also discussed. This review also considers alternative interventions to control C. jejuni in poultry production, in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance. It explores the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, bacteriocins, bacteriophages, vaccines, and organic acids, with a focus on their mechanisms of action in reducing bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Studies show that mixtures of organic acids and compounds like Carvacrol and Eugenol significantly downregulate genes linked with motility and adhesion, thereby disrupting biofilm integrity. It discusses the impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and oxygen levels on biofilm formation, providing insights into how industrial conditions can be manipulated to reduce contamination. This paper stresses the need for a multifaceted approach to control Campylobacter in poultry, integrating molecular and genetic insights with practical interventions. By advancing our understanding of biofilm dynamics and gene regulation, we aim to inform the development of more effective strategies to enhance food safety and protect public health.","Bundurus I.A., Balta I., Pet I., Stef L., Popescu C.A., Mccleery D., Lemon J., Callaway T., Douglas A., Corcionivoschi N.",10.1016/j.psj.2024.104328,Poultry Science
Silver Ion-Doped Calcium Phosphate-Based Bone-Graft Substitute Eliminates Chronic Osteomyelitis: An Experimental Study In Animals,"Despite the latest technologies and advances in microbiology and orthopedic surgery, chronic osteomyelitis is still a challenging disorder. Antibiotic resistance and bacterially induced bone destruction can have very serious consequences. We hypothesized that calcium phosphate-based bone graft substitution with silver ion doping would simultaneously treat bone infection and the bony defect in the chronic osteomyelitis. An unicortical 10-mm-diameter bone was harvested in the proximal tibial metaphysis of 24 rabbits. After contaminating the wounds with an infective dose of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), osteomyelitis was proven radiographically and microbiologically in all rabbits. Animals were than divided into three groups. The first group received vancomycin-impregnated bone cement beads (comparative control group), the second/experimental group received silver ion-doped calcium phosphate beads and the third group received pure calcium phosphate beads (negative controls). Radiographs, intraosseous cultures, and histopathological examinations were performed on postoperative Week 10. The cultures showed no evidence of intramedullary infection in the silver ion-doped calcium phosphate beads group, but they were positive for MRSA in four of the six rabbits in the vancomycin- impregnated bone cement beads group and in all of the eight rabbits in the pure calcium phosphate beads group. Quantitative assessment of histopathological examination showed lowest total damage score in silver ion-doped calcium phosphate beads group (p <.001). Percentage of osteoid tissue + bony tissue was also higher in this group compared with other groups. In the final radiological examinations, it was observed that the changes caused by osteomyelitis in the bone tissue in the silver ion-doped calcium phosphate beads group were much improved compared with the vancomycin-impregnated bone cement beads group. Silver ion doped calcium phosphate-based bone-graft substitute offer the ability to stimulate bone growth, combat infection, and, ultimately, treat experimental chronic osteomyelitis in an animal model.","Köse N., Asfuroğlu Z.M., Köse A., Şahintürk V., Gürbüz M., Doğan A.",10.1002/jor.24946,Journal Of Orthopaedic Research
On-Flow Immobilization Of Polystyrene Microspheres On Β-Cyclodextrin-Patterned Silica Surfaces Through Supramolecular Host-Guest Interactions,"Species-specific isolation of microsized entities such as microplastics and resistant bacteria from waste streams is becoming a growing environmental challenge. By studying the on-flow immobilization of micron-sized polystyrene particles onto functionalized silica surfaces, we ascertain if supramolecular host-guest chemistry in aqueous solutions can provide an alternative technology for water purification. Polystyrene particles were modified with different degrees of adamantane (guest) molecules, and silica surfaces were patterned with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD, host) through microcontact printing (μCP). The latter was exposed to solutions of these particles flowing at different speeds, allowing us to study the effect of flow rate and multivalency on particle binding to the surface. The obtained binding profile was correlated with Comsol simulations. We also observed that particle binding is directly aligned with particle's ability to form host-guest interactions with the β-CD-patterned surface, as particle binding to the functionalized glass surface increased with higher adamantane load on the polystyrene particle surface. Because of the noncovalent character of these interactions, immobilization is reversible and modified β-CD surfaces can be recycled, which provides a positive outlook for their incorporation in water purification systems.","Willems S.B.J., Bunschoten A., Wagterveld R.M., Van Leeuwen F.W.B., Velders A.H.",10.1021/acsami.9b11069,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces
Systematic Review Of Patient-Oriented Interventions To Reduce Unnecessary Use Of Antibiotics For Upper Respiratory Tract Infections,"Background: Antibiotics are prescribed frequently for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) even though most URTIs do not require antibiotics. This over-prescription contributes to antibiotic resistance which is a major health problem globally. As physicians' prescribing behaviour is influenced by patients' expectations, there may be some opportunities to reduce antibiotic prescribing using patient-oriented interventions. We aimed to identify these interventions and to understand which ones are more effective in reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics for URTIs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL, and the Web of Science. We included English language randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. Two authors screened the abstract/titles and full texts, extracted data, and assessed study risk of bias. Where pooling was appropriate, a meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model. Where pooling of the data was not possible, a narrative synthesis of results was conducted. Results: We included 13 studies (one ITS, one cluster RCTs, and eleven RCTs). All interventions could be classified into two major categories: delayed prescriptions (seven studies) and patient/public information and education interventions (six studies). Our meta-analysis of delayed prescription studies observed significant reductions in the use of antibiotics for URTIs (OR = 0.09, CI 0.03 to 0.23; six studies). A subgroup analysis showed that prescriptions that were given at a later time and prescriptions that were given at the index consultation had similar effects. The studies in the patient/public information and education group varied according to their methods of delivery. Since only one or two studies were included for each method, we could not make a definite conclusion on their effectiveness. In general, booklets or pamphlets demonstrated promising effects on antibiotic prescription, if discussed by a practitioner. Conclusions: Patient-oriented interventions (especially delayed prescriptions) may be effective in reducing antibiotic prescription for URTIs. Further research is needed to investigate the costs and feasibility of implementing these interventions as part of routine clinical practice.

Stronger Geographic Limitations Shape A Rapid Turnover And Potentially Highly Connected Network Of Core Bacteria On Microplastics,"Core microbiota is shared microbial taxa within the same habitat, which is important for understanding the stable and consistent components of the complex microbial assembly. However, information on the microplastic core bacteria from the river ecosystems is poor. Here, we investigated the composition and function of microplastic core bacteria from the Three Gorges Reservoir area along the approximate 662 km of the Yangtze River via full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, compared with those in water, sediment, and soil. The results showed that the spatial turnover of bacterial communities in four habitats supported deterministic processes dominated by niche differentiation, which shaped their core bacteria. The composition and function of microplastic core bacteria were significantly different from those in the other three habitats. Rhodobacteraceae was the main component of microplastic core bacteria, while the main component of core bacteria in water, sediment, and soil were Burkholderiaceae (21.90%), Burkholderiaceae (5.01%), Nitrosomonadaceae (4.61%), respectively. Furthermore, microplastic core bacteria had stronger geographic limitations along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Stronger geographic limitations shaped the rapid community turnover and a potentially more connected network for the microplastic core bacteria than water, sediment, and soil. More importantly, microplastic core bacteria had strong potential functions of drug resistance and could cause risks to ecosystems and human health. Microplastic core bacteria were mainly influenced by sediment core bacteria, although the bacteria colonizing on microplastics could be from all the contact environments and original sources. These findings provide important insights into the composition, function, and association of microplastic core bacteria with their surrounding environment.","Zhang W., Wan W., Liu X., Yang Y., Liu M.",10.1007/s00248-022-02000-0,Microbial Ecology
Medical Applications Of Hydrogels In Skin Infections: A Review,"Skin infections are common diseases for which patients seek inpatient and outpatient medical care. Globally, an increasing number of people are affected by skin infections that could lead to physical and psychological damage. Skin infections always have a broad spectrum of clinical presentations that require physicians to make an aggressive and accurate diagnosis for prescribing the proper symptomatic antimicrobials. In most instances, the treatment for skin infections mainly includes oral or topical anti-infective drugs. However, some of the classical anti-infective drugs have limitations, such as poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and poor targeting efficiency, which can lead to poor efficacy, adverse effects, and drug resistance. Therefore, research priorities should focus on the development of more effective drug delivery systems with new materials. Hydrogels are a highly multifunctional class of medical materials with potential applications in dermatology. Several hydrogel dressings with anti-infective functions have been formulated and demonstrated to improve the efficacy and tolerance of oral or topical classical anti-infective drugs to a certain degree. In this study, the medical applications of hydrogels for the treatment of various skin infections are systematically reviewed to provide an important theoretical reference for future research studies on the treatment options for skin infections.","Teng Y., Li S., Tang H., Tao X., Fan Y., Huang Y.",10.2147/IDR.S396990,Infection And Drug Resistance
Global Performance And Trends Of Research On Emerging Contaminants In Sewage Sludge: A Bibliometric Analysis From 1990 To 2023,"The pervasive occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in sewage sludge (SWS) poses significant safety challenges concerning the processing, disposal, and secure application, ultimately jeopardizing both human health and the ecological environment. To comprehensively comprehend the evolutionary trajectories, present state, and research advancements in the field of ECs in SWS, a systematic was conducted, scrutinizing the annual publication quantity, disciplinary distribution, core authors, involved nations/regions, pertinent keywords, and citation status of 2082 research publications related to ECs in SWS from 1990 to 2023. The results indicate a substantial upward trajectory in the research literature pertaining to ECs in SWS. The study of ECs in SWS encompasses 78 disciplines, including Environmental Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Water Resources. China, Spain, and the USA ranked among the top three countries in terms of both total publications and citation frequency. The majority of publications were published in reputable high-impact journals such as Science of the Total Environment, Chemosphere, and Bioresource Technology. Based on high-frequency keywords, co-occurrence networks of keywords, and keywords burst analysis, it is found that the occurrence and environment behavior of ECs in SWS (ARGs, microplastics, PPCPs, and POPs), the detection and analytical methods, the impact on SWS treatment and disposal processes, and the accumulation and ecological risks in plants and soil during SWS land utilization, are the main research directions and hot topics in this field. In the future, the study of the impact of SWS treatment technologies on ECs removal is expected to receive increased research attention.","Li Z., Yuan D.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116597,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Systematic Review Of The Microbiology Of Osteomyelitis Associated With War Injuries In The Middle East And North Africa,"Osteomyelitis is a serious complication associated with war-related limb injuries requiring complicated treatment regimens and management. Few reports have been published from the Middle-East and North-Africa regions about the microbial aetiology of osteomyelitis caused by war injuries. The aim of this review is to collect published data about the microbiology of osteomyelitis in war-related injuries in the region and to derive targeted treatment regimens to manage these serious and limb-threatening infections. A thorough literature search was done using six search engines for pertinent articles. Articles with a minimum of five cases of osteomyelitis from war wounds, citation of microbial aetiology and mention of the timing of cultures obtained in relation to injury were included. Nine studies that met the eligibility criteria were included, involving 1644 patients and a total of 2332 cultures. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 1184 cultures, and Gram-positive bacteria were identified from 1148 cultures. Antibiotic coverage should be tailored for Gram-negative organisms in the early stages and Gram-positives in the chronic phase, respectively, with broader coverage reserved for critically ill patients. There is a dire need for further and larger studies about osteomyelitis from war injuries for targeted treatment.","Ghieh F., Bizri A.R., Beaineh P., Chalhoub R., Abu Sittah G.",10.1080/13623699.2023.2193862,"Medicine, Conflict, And Survival"
Extracellular Vesicles As Novel Diagnostic And Therapeutic Agents For Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Standard non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) treatment involves surgery, recently combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in cases of advanced tumors. EVs, including exosomes, are integral to carcinogenesis, and are found in NMSC releasing mediators impacting tumor progression. Nevertheless, the precise intercellular signaling role of NMSC-derived EVs remains unclear. This review aims to elucidate their potential role in NMSC diagnosis and treatment. This systematic review encompassed literature searches in electronic databases from inception to September 2023, based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, addressing NMSC-derived EVs, their molecular cargo, and their implications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of NMSC. Key components were identified. Extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins and RNA have emerged as diagnostic biomarkers in EV-based liquid biopsy. Circular RNA CYP24A1, known for its molecular stability, holds promise as a diagnostic biomarker. Long noncoding RNAs (lincRNA-PICSAR) and Desmoglein 2 (DSg2) are linked to drug resistance, serving as prognostic biomarkers. EV mediators are being actively investigated for their potential role as drug delivery agents. In conclusion, this systematic review showed that NMSC-derived EVs display promise as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. Further research is imperative to fully comprehend EV mechanisms and explore their potential in cancer diagnosis and treatment.","Seretis K., Boptsi E., Boptsi A.",10.3390/ijms25052617,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Identification Of Cd24 As A Marker For Tumorigenesis Of Melanoma,"Objective: Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a common skin cancer. Surgery is still the primary treatment for CM, as melanoma is resistant to chemotherapy. In the recent years, it has been found that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are responsible for this drug resistance. CD24 is a widely used marker to isolate CSCs. In this study, we aimed to analyze the properties of CD24(+) and CD24(−) subpopulation of melanoma cells. Materials and methods: We isolated CD24(+) cells CSCs using magnetic-activated cell sorting system. We extracted total RNA and carried out reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. We counted the cell colonies using soft agar assay and assessed the cell invasion using cell migration assay. We implanted CD24(+) or CD24(−) cells into the flank of non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency mice, and measured the tumor volumes every 5 days until the end of the experiment. We carried out immunohistochemical analysis to study the tissue sections. Results: We demonstrated that the CD24(+) subpopulation has self-renewal properties in vitro and in vivo by using soft agar assay and xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, we confirmed that CD24 expression is accompanied by activation of Notch1 signaling pathway. Conclusion: This study provides new knowledge on the role of CD24 in the tumorigenic ability of melanoma.","Tang M.-R., Guo J.-Y., Wang D., Xu N.",10.2147/OTT.S157043,Oncotargets And Therapy
Current Perspectives On Diagnosis And Management Of Sternal Wound Infections,"Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI), also known as mediastinitis, is a serious and potentially fatal condition. The diagnosis and treatment of DSWI are challenging. In this current narrative review, the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and surgical and antimicrobial management of DSWI are discussed. Ideally, the management of DSWI requires early and sufficient surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy. When foreign material is present, biofilm-active antibiotic therapy is also needed. Because DSWI is often complex, the management requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiothoracic surgeons, plastic surgeons, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and clinical microbiologists.","Yusuf E., Chan M., Renz N., Trampuz A.",10.2147/IDR.S130172,Infection And Drug Resistance

Conclusion: Since remarkable enhanced efficiency of Tf and synergistic effect of the drugs, it could inhibit the lung tumor growth and help with the lung cancer treatment.","Mao K., Zhang W., Yu L., Yu Y., Liu H., Zhang X.",10.2147/DDDT.S296253,"Drug Design, Development And Therapy"
"Prevalence Of Rectal Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacterales Carriage Among Patients Attending Healthcare Facilities In Ibadan, Nigeria: A Descriptive Study","Background: Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections are increasingly associated with or directly responsible for morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections in sub-Saharan Africa where there are limited antibiotic options. CRE rectal colonization of patients in healthcare facilities provides a reservoir of these organisms and could potentially cause invasive infections in these settings. The prevalence of rectal carriage among patients attending healthcare facilities in Nigeria has not been previously described. We set out to assess the prevalence of rectal CRE carriage and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns among patients attending healthcare facilities in Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2021 to September 2022 in Ibadan, in which patients attending primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities were screened for rectal carriage of CRE by microscopy, culture and sensitivity of rectal swab specimens. Results: A total of 291 patients were screened; 45 (15.5%), 66 (22.7%) and 180 (61.8%) at primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities, respectively. All but one of them had received a third-generation cephalosporin or carbapenem in the preceding 30 days. The mean age was 28.8 years and 55.7% were male. Overall, 51 (17.5%) participants had CRE colonization, with 5(11.1%), 9(13.6%) and 37(20.6%) at primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities, respectively (p = 0.243). Regarding antimicrobial susceptibility, 43(84.3%) CRE isolates were resistant to at least 3 different classes of antibiotics while two Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to all 5 classes of antibiotics tested. The lowest rates of CRE resistance were to tigecycline (6, 11.5%) and colistin (8, 15.7%). Conclusions: In this first study on CRE colonization in Nigeria, we found that a substantial proportion of patients in three levels of healthcare facilities had rectal carriage of CRE, including pan-resistant isolates. Active surveillance and appropriate infection prevention and control practices (IPC) need to be urgently strengthened to mitigate the risk of active CRE infection.

Results: (1) There were 18 extensively drug-resistant strains and 5 sensitive strains of AB. Samples of extensively drug-resistant strains were mainly collected from Emergency ICU and Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery of our hospital and were mainly from sputum, blood, and wound exudate. Samples of sensitive strains were collected dispersedly and were mainly from sputum. (2) Absorbance values of extensively drug-resistant strains and sensitive strains of AB at all culture time points were similar (with P values above 0.05). Absorbance value of extensively drug-resistant strains of AB at culture hour 24 was obviously higher than that of these strains at culture hour 12, 48, or 72 (with P values below 0.01). Absorbance value of sensitive strains of AB at culture hour 24 was obviously higher than that of these strains at culture hour 12 (P<0.01). (3) AbaR gene sequence of LuxR type receptor existed in AB. Similarity ratio between abaR gene sequence and LuxR type receptor AqsR gene sequence in Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 was 87%. Similarity ratios between abaR gene sequence of No. 87 and No. 96 strains and ATCC 17978 of AB were 98% and 99%, respectively. (4) Absorbance values of 0.1% DMSO group of No. 87 strain at all culture time points were similar to those of 1% DMSO group (with P values above 0.05). Absorbance value of 0.1% DMSO group of No. 96 strain at culture hour 12 was obviously lower than that of 1% DMSO group (P<0.01), while that at culture hour 24 was obviously lower than that of 1% DMSO group (P<0.01). Absorbance values of 10 μmol/L C7-HSL group of No. 87 and No. 96 strains at culture hour 24 were obviously lower than those of 0.1% DMSO group (with P values below 0.01).

"Covid-19 Associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis: Clinical Features, Antifungal Susceptibility, Management And Outcome In A Tertiary Hospital In Iran","BACKGROUND: Despite the unprecedented surge in the incidence of mucormycosis in the COVID-19 era, the antifungal susceptibility patterns (ASPs) of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) isolates have not been investigated so far and it is unclear if the high mortality rate associated with CAM is driven by decreased susceptibility of Mucorales to antifungal drugs. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical, mycological, outcome and in vitro ASPs of CAM cases and their etiologies from Iran. PATIENTS/METHODS: A prospective study from January 2020 to January 2022 at a referral tertiary hospital in Tehran, Iran was conducted for screening mucormycosis through histopathology and mycological methods. The identity of Mucorales isolates was revealed with ITS-panfungal PCR& sequencing and MALDI-TOF. The AS for amphotericin B, itraconazole, isavuconazole and posaconazole was cleared according to the EUCAST antifungal susceptibility testing protocol. RESULT: A total of 150 individuals were diagnosed with CAM. Males constituted 60.7% of the population. The mean age was 54.9 years. Diabetes was the leading risk factor (74.7%). The median interval between diagnosis of COVID-19 and CAM was 31 days. The recovery rate of culture was as low as 41.3% with Rhizopus arrhizus being identified as the dominant (60; 96.7%) agent. Amphotericin B (MIC50 = 0.5 µg/ml) demonstrated the highest potency against Mucorales. CONCLUSION: Majority of the cases had either diabetes, history of corticosteroid therapy or simultaneously both conditions. Accordingly, close monitoring of blood glucose should be considered. The indications for corticosteroids therapy are recommended to be optimized. Also, an anti Mucorales prophylaxis may be necessitated to be administrated in high risk individuals. Although amphotericin B was the most active agent, a higher rate of resistance to this antifungal was noted here in comparison with earlier studies on mucormycetes from non-CAM cases.","Abdorahimi M., Pakdel F., Salehi M., Alcazar-Fuoli L., Hashemi S.J., Daie Ghazvini R., Ahmadkhani F., Ahmadikia K., Abdollahi A., Debran J.C.S., Tabari A., Farrokh F., Mousavand A., Afarinesh Khaki P., Salami Khaneshan A., Ibrahim A.S., Khodavaisy S.",10.1007/s11046-023-00785-3,Mycopathologia
Does The Use Of Dacc-Coated Dressings Improve Clinical Outcomes For Hard To Heal Wounds: A Systematic Review,"Reports of overuse and antimicrobial resistance have fuelled some clinicians to adopt alternative wound dressings termed to be non-medicated or non-antimicrobials, which still claim antimicrobial or antibacterial activity.

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Framework was adopted as the template in constructing this systematic review. The PICO format (Population [or patients], Intervention, Comparison [control], Outcome/s) was used to identify key clinical questions in determining patient outcomes under two domains (infection control and wound healing). A systematic search was performed in PubMed, OVID, Cochrane Library, clinical trial registries and data sources from independent committees. Abstracts of all studies were screened independently by two reviewers, with six further reviewers independently assessing records proceeding to full review. The authors rated the quality of evidence for each of the outcomes critical to decision making. After excluding duplicates, 748 records were screened from the databases, and 13 records were sought for full review. After full review, we excluded a further three records, leaving ten records for data extraction. Three records were narrative reviews, three systematic reviews, two prospective non-comparative before/after studies, one prospective head-to-head comparator cohort study and one retrospective head-to-head comparator cohort study. No RCTs or case versus control studies were identified. The overall quality of clinical evidence for the use of DACC-coated dressing to improve wound infection and wound healing outcomes was assessed as very low. There is an urgent unmet need to perform appropriately designed RCTs or case–control studies. The extracted data provide no clarity and have limited to no evidence to support that using a DACC-coated dressing improves wound infection or wound healing outcomes. Further, there is no evidence to suggest this therapy is either superior to standard of wound care or equivocal to topical antimicrobial agents in the management of infected hard to heal wounds.","Schwarzer S., Martinez J.L., Killeen A., Alves P., Gledhill A., Nygren E., Lavery L.A., Malone M.",10.1111/iwj.70053,International Wound Journal
The Immunomodulator Decoy Receptor 3 Improves Locomotor Functional Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury,"Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurons and axons and results in motor and sensory function impairments. SCI elicits an inflammatory response and induces the infiltration of immune cells, predominantly macrophages, to the injured site. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member (TNFRSF)-6B, is a pleiotropic immunomodulator capable of inducing macrophage differentiation into the M2 phenotype and enhancing angiogenesis. Because M2 macrophages are crucial for the recovery of impaired motor functions, we ask whether DcR3 is beneficial for the functional recovery of locomotion in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats after SCI. Methods: Contusion injury of the spinal cord was performed using a New York University impactor at the ninth thoracic vertebrae, followed by intrathecal injection of 15 μg recombinant protein comprising DcR3 (DcR3.Fc) in 5 μl of normal saline as the treatment, or 5 μl of normal saline as the control, into the injury epicenter. Functional recovery was evaluated using an open-field test weekly up to 6 weeks after injury. The cavity size and myelin sparing in the rostral-to-caudal region, including the epicenter of the injury, were then examined in SCI rats by histological staining. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of M2 macrophages were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry at 7 day after SCI. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. Results: Intrathecal administration of DcR3.Fc significantly improved locomotor function and reduced secondary injury with a smaller wound cavity and increased myelin sparing at the lesion site. Compared with the control group, DcR3.Fc-treated rats had increased vascularization at the injury epicenter along with higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and lower level of IL-1β on DcR3.Fc-treated rats at day 7 after SCI. Moreover, higher levels of arginase I (Arg I) and CD206 (M2 macrophage markers) and RECA-1 (endothelial marker) were observed in the epicenter on day 7 after SCI by immunofluorescence staining. Conclusions: These results indicated that DcR3.Fc may promote the M2 macrophage infiltration and enhanced angiogenesis at the lesion site, thus preserving a greater amount of spinal cord tissues and enhancing functional recovery after SCI.","Chiu C.-W., Huang W.-H., Lin S.-J., Tsai M.-J., Ma H., Hsieh S.-L., Cheng H.",10.1186/s12974-016-0623-6,Journal Of Neuroinflammation
Admsc-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Acute Lung Injury Via Transferring Mitochondrial Component To Improve Homeostasis Of Alveolar Macrophages,"Rationale: Aberrant activation of macrophages with mitochondria dismiss was proved to be associated with pathogenesis of ALI (acute lung injury). Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC-Exos) have been distinguished by their low immunogenicity, lack of tumorigenicity, and high clinical safety, but their role in treating ALI and the mechanism involved need to be defined. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the mitochondrial donation from AdMSC-Exos provides profound protection against LPS-induced ALI in mice, accompanied by improvement of macrophage mitochondrial function. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (1 mg/kg). AdMSC-Exos were administered via the tail vein 4 h after LPS inhalation. Flow cytometry, H&E, Quantitative Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), confocal microscopy imaging was conducted to investigate lung tissue inflammation and macrophage mitochondrial function. And further observe the transfer of exosomes and the effect on mitochondrial function of MH-S cells through in vitro experiments. Results: AdMSC-Exos can transfer the stem cell-derived mitochondria components to alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Likely through complementing the damaged mitochondria, AdMSC-Exos exhibited the ability to elevate the level of mtDNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), OXPHOS activity and ATP generation, while reliving mROS stress in LPS-challenged macrophages. Restoring mitochondrial integrity via AdMSC-Exos treatment enabled macrophages shifting to anti-inflammatory phenotype, as featured with the down-regulation of IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS secretion and increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and Arg-1. As we depleted alveolar macrophages using clodronate liposomes, the protective role for AdMSC-Exos was largely abrogated. Conclusions: AdMSC-Exos can effectively donate mitochondria component improved macrophages mitochondrial integrity and oxidative phosphorylation level, leading to the resumption of metabolic and immune homeostasis of airway macrophages and mitigating lung inflammatory pathology.","Xia L., Zhang C., Lv N., Liang Z., Ma T., Cheng H., Xia Y., Shi L.",10.7150/thno.69533,Theranostics
Mek5/Erk5 Signaling Mediates Il-4-Induced M2 Macrophage Differentiation Through Regulation Of C-Myc Expression,"Macrophages are highly plastic cells, responding to diverse environmental stimuli to acquire different functional phenotypes. Signaling through MAPKs has been reported to regulate the differentiation of macrophages, but the role of ERK5 in IL-4-mediated M2 macrophage differentiation is still unclear. Here, we showed that the ERK5 signaling pathway plays a critical role in IL-4-induced M2 macrophage differentiation. Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK5, an upstream activator of ERK5, markedly reduced the expression of classical M2 markers, such as Arg-1, Ym-1, and Fizz-1, as well as the production of M2-related chemokines and cytokines, CCL22, CCL17, and IGF-1 in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of ERK5 also decreased the expression of several M2 markers induced by IL-4. In accordance, myeloid cell-specific Erk5 depletion (Erk5(∆mye)), using LysM(cre)/Erk5(f/f) mice, confirmed the involvement of ERK5 in IL-4-induced M2 polarization. Mechanistically, the inhibition of ERK5 did not affect STAT3 or STAT6 phosphorylation, suggesting that ERK5 signaling regulates M2 differentiation in a STAT3 and STAT6-independent manner. However, genetic deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway reduced the expression of c-Myc in IL-4-activated macrophages, which is a critical transcription factor involved in M2 differentiation. Our study thus suggests that the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway is crucial in IL-4-induced M2 macrophage differentiation through the induction of c-Myc expression.","Luiz J.P.M., Toller-Kawahisa J.E., Viacava P.R., Nascimento D.C., Pereira P.T., Saraiva A.L., Prado D.S., Lebert M., Giurisato E., Tournier C., Cunha T.M., Cunha F.Q., Quesniaux V., Ryffel B., Alves-Filho J.C.",10.1002/JLB.1MA0520-016R,Journal Of Leukocyte Biology
Linc01614 Is A Promising Diagnostic And Prognostic Marker In Hnsc Linked To The Tumor Microenvironment And Oncogenic Function,"Background: Tumor initiation and metastasis influence tumor immune exclusion and immunosuppression. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01614 is associated with the prognosis and metastasis of several cancers. However, the relationship between LINC01614 and cancer immune infiltration and the biofunction of LINC01614 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) remain unclear. Methods: The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to analyze the expression difference and diagnostic value of LINC01614 in normal and tumor tissues. The correlation of pan-cancer prognosis and tumor stage of LINC01614 was analyzed based on the TCGA database. The pan-cancer association of LINC01614 expression with the tumor microenvironment (TME) including immune infiltration, expression of immune-related genes, and genomic instability parameters, was analyzed using the Spearman correlation method. The correlation between LINC01614 and tumor stemness evaluation indicators, RNA methylation-related genes, and drug resistance was also analyzed. The functional analysis of LINC01614 was performed using the clusterProfiler R package. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and ceRNA network of LINC01614 co-expressed genes and miRNA were constructed and visualized by STRING and Cytoscape, respectively. Finally, the cell location and influence of LINC01614 on cell proliferation and metastasis of HNSC cell lines were evaluated using FISH, CCK-8, wound-healing assay, and transwell assay. Results: LINC01614 was found to be overexpressed in 23 cancers and showed a highly sensitive prediction value in nine cancers (AUC >0.85). LINC01614 dysregulation was associated with tumor stage in 12 cancers and significantly influenced the survival outcomes of 26 cancer types, with only Lymphoid Neoplasm Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBC), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) showing a benign influence. LINC01614 was also associated with immune cell infiltration, tumor heterogeneity, cancer stemness, RNA methylation modification, and drug resistance. The potential biological function of LINC01614 was verified in HNSC, and it was found to play important roles in proliferation, immune infiltration, immunotherapy response, and metastasis of HNSC. Conclusion: LINC01614 may serve as a cancer diagnosis and prognosis biomarker and an immunotherapy target for specific cancers.","Tian X., Hu D., Wang N., Zhang L., Wang X.",10.3389/fgene.2024.1337525,Frontiers In Genetics
Comparative Genomics And Dna Methylation Analysis Of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Clinical Isolate Pa3 By Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing Reveals New Targets For Antimicrobials,"Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa) is an important opportunistic pathogen with broad environmental adaptability and complex drug resistance. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technique has longer read-length sequences, more accuracy, and the ability to identify epigenetic DNA alterations. Methods: This study applied SMRT technology to sequence a clinical strain P. aeruginosa PA3 to obtain its genome sequence and methylation modification information. Genomic, comparative, pan-genomic, and epigenetic analyses of PA3 were conducted. Results: General genome annotations of PA3 were discovered, as well as information about virulence factors, regulatory proteins (RPs), secreted proteins, type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) pairs, and genomic islands. A genome-wide comparison revealed that PA3 was comparable to other P. aeruginosa strains in terms of identity, but varied in areas of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PA3 was closely related to P. aeruginosa 60503 and P. aeruginosa 8380. P. aeruginosa's pan-genome consists of a core genome of roughly 4,300 genes and an accessory genome of at least 5,500 genes. The results of the epigenetic analysis identified one main methylation sites, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 1 motif (CATNNNNNNNTCCT/AGGANNNNNNNATG). 16 meaningful methylated sites were picked. Among these, purH, phaZ, and lexA are of great significance playing an important role in the drug resistance and biological environment adaptability of PA3, and the targeting of these genes may benefit further antibacterial studies. Disucssion: This study provided a detailed visualization and DNA methylation information of the PA3 genome and set a foundation for subsequent research into the molecular mechanism of DNA methyltransferase-controlled P. aeruginosa pathogenicity.","Li Z., Zhou X., Liao D., Liu R., Zhao X., Wang J., Zhong Q., Zeng Z., Peng Y., Tan Y., Yang Z.",10.3389/fcimb.2023.1180194,Frontiers In Cellular And Infection Microbiology
Use Of Nanotechnology For Infectious Disease Diagnostics: Application In Drug Resistant Tuberculosis,"Background: The increased transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) poses a challenge to tuberculosis prevention and control in Sri Lanka. Isoniazid (INH) is a key element of the first line anti tuberculosis treatment regimen. Resistance to INH may lead to development of MDR TB. Therefore, early detection of INH resistance is important to curb spread of resistance. Due to the limited availability of rapid molecular methods for detection of drug resistance in Sri Lanka, this study was aimed at developing a simple and rapid gold nanoparticle (AuNP) based lateral flow strip for the simultaneous detection of the most common INH resistance mutation (katG S315 T, 78.6%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb). Methods: Lateral flow strip was designed on an inert plastic backing layer containing a sample pad, nitrocellulose membrane and an absorption pad. Biotin labeled 4 capture probes which separately conjugated with streptavidin were immobilized on the nitrocellulose. The test sample was prepared by multiplex PCR using primers to amplify codon 315 region of the katG gene and MTb specific IS6110 region. The two detection probes complementary to the 5′ end of each amplified fragment was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (20 nm) and coupled with the above amplified PCR products were applied on the sample pad. The hybridization of the amplified target regions to the respective capture probes takes place when the sample moves towards the absorption pad. Positive hybridization is indicated by red colour lines. Results: The three immobilized capture probes on the strip (for the detection of TB, katG wild type and mutation) were 100 and 96.6% specific and 100 and 92.1% sensitive respectively. Conclusion: The AuNP based lateral flow assay was capable of differentiating the specific mutation and the wild type along with MTb identification within 3 h.","Karunaratne R.E., Wijenayaka L.A., Wijesundera S.S., De Silva K.M.N., Adikaram C.P., Perera J.",10.1186/s12879-019-4259-x,Bmc Infectious Diseases
Case Report: Continuous Infusions Of Ceftazidime-Avibactam And Aztreonam In Combination Through Elastomeric Infusors For 12 Weeks For The Treatment Of Bone And Joint Infections Due To Metallo-Β-Lactamase Producing Enterobacterales,"Among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains represent a growing therapeutic challenge. While the association of aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam has been investigated in recent years for the treatment of infections involving these strains, little to no clinical data support the use of this association for the treatment of bone and joint infections. We report two cases of complex bone and joint infections involving metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, successfully treated at our referral center with aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam for 12 weeks in continuous infusions through elastomeric infusors.","Merad Y., Conrad A., Brosset S., Schmidt A., Hanriat C., Lustig S., Laurent F., Kolenda C., Roussel-Gaillard T., Batailler C., Ferry T.",10.3389/fmed.2023.1224922,Frontiers In Medicine
Antibiotic Treatment For Dry Eye Disease Related To Meibomian Gland Dysfunction And Blepharitis – A Review,"Background: Dry eye disease (DED) is among the most prevalent ophthalmic conditions but is often underdiagnosed and mistreated. Antibiotics are regularly used to treat DED caused by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or blepharitis, but their use has been questioned. Objective: To critically evaluate the use of oral and topical antibiotics in DED management. Methods: A literature search was conducted on November 15th, 2021, in the PubMed database. The search terms were: (antibiotics OR azithromycin OR doxycycline OR minocycline) AND (dry eye disease OR meibomian gland OR blepharitis anterior OR blepharitis posterior OR chronic blepharitis). All relevant original articles with English full-text were included. Case reports and review articles were excluded. Results: The search provided 619 articles, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Oral and topical antibiotics appeared to have short-term positive effects on signs and symptoms of blepharitis- or MGD-related DED. However, these improvements often reverted upon cessation of treatment. The need for repeated treatments and mild adverse events were common. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that patients with blepharitis- or MGD-related DED experience short-term benefits of antibiotics. However, evidence for lasting improvement after completed treatment was lacking. Given the unclear long-term benefits, common side effects, and increasing antibiotic resistance seen globally, the existing literature is not sufficient to conclude that antibiotics are useful in long-term MGD management. A survival-analysis of a single round of antibiotics, in addition to the effects of repeated rounds of treatment, on DED parameters could provide useful insights.","Vernhardsdottir R.R., Magno M.S., Hynnekleiv L., Lagali N., Dartt D.A., Vehof J., Jackson C.J., Utheim T.P.",10.1016/j.jtos.2022.08.010,Ocular Surface
Mage-A11 Expression Contributes To Cisplatin Resistance In Head And Neck Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the roles of melanoma-associated antigens (MAGEs) in the cisplatin treatment of head and neck cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the efficacy of cisplatin in a set of four head and neck cancer cell lines using a crystal violet assay. The MAGE-A expression in all cell lines was measured with RT-qPCR. The correlation between MAGE-A expression and cisplatin efficacy was investigated using Spearman's correlation analysis. Furthermore, we established a cell line with stable overexpression of MAGE-A11 and determined influence on proliferation, cisplatin efficacy and cell apoptosis. In this cell line, the effects of cisplatin were assessed using either crystal violet assays or flow cytometry (Annexin V). RESULTS: For MAGE-A11, we observed the highest correlation (r = 1.000, p = 0.0417) with low cisplatin efficacy. Stable overexpression of MAGE-A11 resulted in no changes in proliferation, but in lower cisplatin cytotoxicity and lower rates of apoptosis. Also, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) expression was induced by MAGE-A11 overexpression. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that MAGE-A11 expression contributes to cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study underscores the negative predictive role of MAGE-A11 expression in head and neck cancer.","Hartmann S., Zwick L., Scheurer M.J.J., Fuchs A.R., Brands R.C., Seher A., Böhm H., Kübler A.C., Müller-Richter U.D.A.",10.1007/s00784-017-2242-8,Clinical Oral Investigations
Three-Dimensional In Vitro Cell Culture Models In Drug Discovery And Drug Repositioning,"Drug development is a lengthy and costly process that proceeds through several stages from target identification to lead discovery and optimization, preclinical validation and clinical trials culminating in approval for clinical use. An important step in this process is high-throughput screening (HTS) of small compound libraries for lead identification. Currently, the majority of cell-based HTS is being carried out on cultured cells propagated in two-dimensions (2D) on plastic surfaces optimized for tissue culture. At the same time, compelling evidence suggests that cells cultured in these non-physiological conditions are not representative of cells residing in the complex microenvironment of a tissue. This discrepancy is thought to be a significant contributor to the high failure rate in drug discovery, where only a low percentage of drugs investigated ever make it through the gamut of testing and approval to the market. Thus, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture technologies that more closely resemble in vivo cell environments are now being pursued with intensity as they are expected to accommodate better precision in drug discovery. Here we will review common approaches to 3D culture, discuss the significance of 3D cultures in drug resistance and drug repositioning and address some of the challenges of applying 3D cell cultures to high-throughput drug discovery.",Langhans S.A.,10.3389/fphar.2018.00006,Frontiers In Pharmacology
"Common Hydrotherapy Practices And The Prevalence Of Burn Wound Bacterial Colonisation At The University Teaching Hospital In Lusaka, Zambia","Background: In many parts of the world, hydrotherapy plays an important role in the management of patients with wounds including burns. Different centers practice hydrotherapy differently. At the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, burn patients use a common bathtub for cleaning their wounds which theoretically increases the risk of cross-infection, an important source of morbidity and mortality. There is currently no evidence that hydrotherapy as practiced at our institution leads to cross infection among patients with burns. Objective: The objective was to determine if our hydrotherapy practice and water plays a role in cross-infection and what organisms cause this infection. Methods: This was a prospective analytical study. Patients meeting the selection criteria were recruited. Swabs from the burn wounds were collected on admission (day 0), day 4 and day 7. Weekly swabs of the bathtub were also collected, after the tub had been cleaned and declared ready for the next patient. Weekly water samples were also collected. Selected results, for Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subjected to further analysis and PCR. Results were analyzed using statistics software, SPSS version 23. Results: In this study, there were 96 participants of which 51 (53.1%) were males and 45 (46.9%) were females. Age distribution ranged from 5months to 91 years. The modal age range was 1 to 2 years. The modal burn percentage was 6%–10%, followed by 11%–15%. Hot water was the cause of burns in 65.6%. S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were the most common organisms isolated. Others were enteric organisms. In terms of readily available antibiotics, there was more sensitivity to Amikacin and Chloramphenicol than Ciprofloxacin (our commonly used antibiotic). The bathtub also had S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, besides enteric organisms. Sixty five point four percent (65.4%) of the Klebsiella were ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase) producers. The tub had samples that were both ESBL producers as well as widely resistant Klebsiella by other means. No growth was obtained from the water samples. Seventy-two point nine percent (72.9%) of the patients were discharged, 19.8% died, while 7.3% left against medical advice. Conclusion: Hydrotherapy as currently practiced at the University Teaching Hospital does contribute significantly to cross-infection among burn patients with widely resistant organisms. The main ones are S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. Switching care to a shower mechanism might help eliminate this problem as the study demonstrates that no bacteria were found in the water samples.","Ziwa M., Jovic G., Ngwisha C.L.T., Molnar J.A., Kwenda G., Samutela M., Mulowa M., Kalumbi M.M.",10.1016/j.burns.2018.11.019,Burns
Dual Predation By Bacteriophage And Bdellovibrio Bacteriovorus Can Eradicate Escherichia Coli Prey In Situations Where Single Predation Cannot,"Bacteria are preyed upon by diverse microbial predators, including bacteriophage and predatory bacteria, such as Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. While bacteriophage are used as antimicrobial therapies in Eastern Europe and are being applied for compassionate use in the United States, predatory bacteria are only just beginning to reveal their potential therapeutic uses. However, predation by either predator type can falter due to different adaptations arising in the prey bacteria. When testing poultry farm wastewater for novel Bdellovibrio isolates on Escherichia coli prey lawns, individual composite plaques were isolated containing both an RTP (rosette-tailed-phage)-like-phage and a B. bacteriovorus strain and showing central prey lysis and halos of extra lysis. Combining the purified phage with a lab strain of B. bacteriovorus HD100 recapitulated haloed plaques and increased killing of the E. coli prey in liquid culture, showing an effective side-by-side action of these predators compared to their actions alone. Using approximate Bayesian computation to select the best fitting from a variety of different mathematical models demonstrated that the experimental data could be explained only by assuming the existence of three prey phenotypes: (i) sensitive to both predators, (ii) genetically resistant to phage only, and (iii) plastic resistant to B. bacteriovorus only. Although each predator reduces prey availability for the other, high phage numbers did not abolish B. bacteriovorus predation, so both predators are competent to coexist and are causing different selective pressures on the bacterial surface while, in tandem, controlling prey bacterial numbers efficiently. This suggests that combinatorial predator therapy could overcome problems of phage resistance. Importance: With increasing levels of antibiotic resistance, the development of alternative antibacterial therapies is urgently needed. Two potential alternatives are bacteriophage and predatory bacteria. Bacteriophage therapy has been used, but prey/host specificity and the rapid acquisition of bacterial resistance to bacteriophage are practical considerations. Predatory bacteria are of interest due to their broad Gram-negative bacterial prey range and the lack of simple resistance mechanisms. Here, a bacteriophage and a strain of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, preyed side by side on a population of E. coli, causing a significantly greater decrease in prey numbers than either alone. Such combinatorial predator therapy may have greater potential than individual predators since prey surface changes selected for by each predator do not protect prey against the other predator.","Hobley L., Summers J.K., Till R., Milner D.S., Atterbury R.J., Stroud A., Capeness M.J., Gray S., Leidenroth A., Lambert C., Connerton I., Twycross J., Baker M., Tyson J., Kreft J.-U., Sockett R.E.",10.1128/JB.00629-19,Journal Of Bacteriology
Genomic Insights Into The Mechanism Of Carbapenem Resistance Dissemination In Enterobacterales From A Tertiary Public Heath Setting In South Asia,"10.6% patients were CRE positive. Only 27% patients were prescribed at least 1 antibiotic to which infecting pathogen was susceptible. Burn and ICU admission and antibiotics exposures facilitate CRE acquisition. Escherichia coli ST167 was the dominant CRE clone. Background: Given the high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) across South Asian (SA) hospitals, we documented the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections at Dhaka Medical College Hospital between October 2016 and September 2017. Methods: We enrolled patients and collected epidemiology and outcome data. All Enterobacterales were characterized phenotypically and by whole-genome sequencing. Risk assessment for the patients with CRE was performed compared with patients with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacterales (CSE). Results: 10.6% of all 1831 patients with a clinical specimen collected had CRE. In-hospital 30-day mortality was significantly higher with CRE [50/180 (27.8%)] than CSE [42/312 (13.5%)] (P =. 001); however, for bloodstream infections, this was nonsignificant. Of 643 Enterobacterales isolated, 210 were CRE; blaNDM was present in 180 isolates, blaOXA-232 in 26, blaOXA-181 in 24, and blaKPC-2 in 5. Despite this, ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed empirical antibiotic and only 27% of patients were prescribed at least 1 antibiotic to which their infecting pathogen was susceptible. Significant risk factors for CRE isolation included burns unit and intensive care unit admission, and prior exposure to levofloxacin, amikacin, clindamycin, and meropenem. Escherichia coli ST167 was the dominant CRE clone. Clustering suggested clonal transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and the MDR hypervirulent clone, ST23. The major trajectories involved in horizontal gene transfer were IncFII and IncX3, IS26, and Tn3.

Investigating Group A Streptococcus Antibiotic Tolerance In Necrotizing Fasciitis,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a difficult-to-treatbacterial infection associated with high morbidity and mortality despite extensive surgery and targeted antibiotic treatment. Difficult-to-treatinfections are often characterized by the presence of bacteria surviving prolonged antibiotic exposure without displaying genetic resistance, referred to as persisters. In the present study, we investigated the presence of GAS persisters in tissue freshly debrided from patients as well as in an in vivo mouse model of NF and examined the phenomenon of antibiotic tolerance. Time-lapse imaging of GAS plated directly upon isolation from NF debrided tissue and an antibiotic challenge-based persisters assay were used to assess the presence of persisters. We show for the firsttime that GAS recovered directly from freshly debrided NF tissue is characterized by heterogeneous and overall delayed colony appearance time, suggesting the presence of persisters. Acidic pH or nutrient stress exposure, mimicking the NF-like environment in vitro, led to a similar phenotypic heterogeneity and resulted in enhanced survival upon antibiotic challenge, confirmingthe presence of GAS persisters. GAS persisters might contribute to NF treatment failure, despite extensive surgery and adequate antibiotic treatment.","Keller N., Boumasmoud M., Andreoni F., Tarnutzer A., Von Matt M., Scheier T.C., Epprecht J., Weller D., Gómez-Mejia A., Huemer M., Von Reibnitz D., Fontein D.B.Y., Marques-Maggio E., Schuepbach R.A., Mairpady-Shambat S., Brugger S.D., Zinkernagel A.S.",10.1128/msphere.00634-24,Msphere
Thermomechanical Ablation-Assisted Photodynamic Therapy For The Treatment Of Acne Vulgaris. A Retrospective Chart Review Of 30 Patients,"Background and Objectives: Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease, affects more than 90% of teenagers. The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are topical and oral medications, mainly antibiotics and retinoids. However, antibiotic resistance of Propionibacterium acnes, contraindications, partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence creates demand for novel treatment options in acne. Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a well-established modality in the treatment of acne. Nevertheless, PDT has limitations: it may not be effective for every patient; several treatments are usually required to achieve sufficient outcome; incubation time is 1–3 hours; treatment pain and post-treatment downtime may be difficult for some patients to endure; and adverse effects may occur. This retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT, assisted by a thermomechanical ablation (TMA) fractional injury device in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe acne. Study Design/Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 acne patients treated with TMA immediately before 5% ALA application with an incubation time of 1 hour and exposure to 60 J/cm(2) red light (630 nm). Patients received up to three monthly treatments and were followed for 16 weeks. Two independent investigators evaluated the subject outcomes according to high definition photographs taken at baseline, before each treatment and at follow-up visits. Three acne grading methods were used: Acne Grading Scoring System (AGSS), the Leeds revised acne grading system, and the general response to the treatment score. Patients also provided self-assessments of improvement using the patient global impression of change (PGIC). Results: Compared with baseline, the AGSS has showed a statistically significant reduction of 26.7% and 23.7%, respectively, at weeks 8 and 16 after final treatment. The Leeds score showed 65.2% and 60.6% improvement at the respective visits. The overall response rate was graded 3.3 ± 0.5 out of 4. PGIC score given by the patients was 5.5 out of 7, reflecting high satisfaction.

Enhancing Thermal Stability And Lytic Activity Of Phage Lysin Plyab1 From Acinetobacter Baumannii,"With the increasingly serious drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii, there is an increasingly urgent need for new antibacterial drugs. Phage lysin PlyAB1 has a bactericidal effect on drug-resistant A. baumannii, which has the potential to replace antibiotics to fight infection caused by A. baumannii. However, its application is limited by its thermal stability and lytic activity. To solve these problems, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Hotspot wizard 3.0 were used to identify key residue sites affecting thermal stability, and evolutionary analysis combined with multiple sequence alignment was used to identify key residue sites affecting lytic activity. Four single-point variants with significantly increased thermal stability and four single-point variants with significantly lytic activity were obtained, respectively. Furthermore, by superimposing mutations, we obtained three double-point variants, G100Q/K69R, G100R/K69R, and G100K/K69R, with significantly improved thermal stability and improved lytic activity. At 45°C, the lytic activity and half-life of the optimal variant G100Q/K69R were 1.51- and 24-fold higher than those of the wild PlyAB1, respectively. These results deepen our understanding of the structure and function of phage lysin and contribute to the application of phage lysin in antibiotic substitution.","Yuan Y., Li Q., Zhang S., Gu J., Huang G., Qi Q., Lu X.",10.1002/bit.28187,Biotechnology And Bioengineering
3D Bioprinting Of Multi-Cellular Tumor Microenvironment For Prostate Cancer Metastasis,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most lethal cancers in men worldwide. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in PCa development, which consists of tumor cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Hyaluronic acid (HA) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components in the TME and are correlated with PCa proliferation and metastasis, while the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood due to the lack of biomimetic ECM components and coculture models. In this study, gelatin methacryloyl/chondroitin sulfate-based hydrogels were physically crosslinked with HA to develop a novel bioink for the three-dimensional bioprinting of a coculture model that can be used to investigate the effect of HA on PCa behaviors and the mechanism underlying PCa-fibroblasts interaction. PCa cells demonstrated distinct transcriptional profiles under HA stimulation, where cytokine secretion, angiogenesis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition were significantly upregulated. Further coculture of PCa with normal fibroblasts activated CAF transformation, which could be induced by the upregulated cytokine secretion of PCa cells. These results suggested HA could not only promote PCa metastasis individually but also induce PCa cells to activate CAF transformation and form HA-CAF coupling effects to further promote PCa drug resistance and metastasis.","Xu K., Huang Y., Wu M., Yin J., Wei P.",10.1088/1758-5090/acd960,Biofabrication
Multifunctional Polycationic Photosensitizer Conjugates With Rich Hydroxyl Groups For Versatile Water-Soluble Photodynamic Therapy Nanoplatforms,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has already shown immense potential in antitumor fields due to its low systemic toxicity and negligible drug resistance. However, the clinical application of current photosensitizers is still restricted by the low singlet oxygen yield or insolubility. Herein, series of star-like hydroxyl-rich polycations (Pc-PGEA/Pc) with flanking phthalocyanine (Pc) were proposed for effective water-soluble photosensitizers. The designed Pc-PGEA/Pc polymers consist of one Pc core and four ethanolamine and Pc-difunctionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) arms. The strong π-π stacking and hydrophobicity of introduced Pc units drive the amphipathic Pc-PGEA/Pc polymers to self-assemble into well-defined cationic nanoparticles. Such Pc-PGEA/Pc nanoparticles present impressive photodynamic therapy effects under moderate irradiation and remarkable photoacoustic imaging (PAI) ability. These kinds of nanoparticles also exhibit good performance as gene vectors. The PAI ability given by the proper wavelength absorbance of Pc units provides one promising method for PAI-guided combined antitumor therapy. The present work would contribute valuable information for the development of new strategies of visible antitumor therapy.","Sun Y., Hu H., Zhao N., Xia T., Yu B., Shen C., Xu.

Effect Of Chlorine Dioxide (Gas) An Alternative Method To Treat Mycological Dermatitis In Canines,"In the Veterinary clinic, skin problems are the main cause of patient visits, since this organ is an indicator of many local or systemic conditions. Among the pathologies present in the skin, dermatitis should be highlighted as the most common and it is the result of many factors: infectious, metabolic, anaerobic, allergic, atopic, congenital or even the environment or habitat of the animal. The most frequent pathologies are the infectious ones, among them the mycotic ones, which are characterized by advancing rapidly, reaching the life of the animal when they are not treated effectively and on time, hence, it was proposed as the objective of this investigation, to evaluate the use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas, as a treatment of fungal dermatitis in dogs. Ten patients who attended the consultation and who presented skin lesions in the distal part of the extremities were selected, which would later allow their introduction into a plastic sheath, where they would come into contact with the gas (CDS). In addition to the gas treatment, pre – and post-test hematological and biochemical analyzes were performed to assess the health status of the patients. The results show that only 3 of the 10 canines subjected to treatment with the gaseous form of CDS showed signs of mycosis recession. A recovery that is seen to be of great interest, even more so when the absence of the fungal germ that affected it was confirmed. Although only 30 % of the patients responded to treatment, CDS in gas is a potential method of alternative therapy, especially in cases where drug resistance is present.","Aucay-Calle J.F., Rubio-Arias P.",10.52973/rcfcv-e32131,Revista Cientifica De La Facultad De Veterinaria
"Cancer Stem Cells, Lymphangiogenesis, And Lymphatic Metastasis","Although current opinion indicates that tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis plays a key role in promoting the initial spread of malignant tumors, the mechanism that underlies lymphatic spread is not clear. The recent discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in human tumors has challenged our current understanding of tumor recurrence, drug resistance, and metastasis, and opens up new research directions on how cancer cells are capable of switching from dormancy to malignancy. CSCs can be directly and indirectly involved in tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis and ultimately promote lymphatic metastasis. However, the details and the possible relationship between CSCs, lymphangiogenesis, and lymphatic metastasis remain ambiguous, and the origin of tumor lymphatic endothelial cells is controversial. Elucidation of these factors may provide useful information for future research and cancer treatment. In this article, we summarize current knowledge of CSCs, tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis, and lymphatic metastasis and attempt to find an association between key molecular and cellular mechanisms. We provide an overview of CSCs and lymphatic vasculature as potential therapeutic targets. CSC- and lymphatic vasculature-targeted therapy may bring new hope for cancer treatment.","Li S., Li Q.",10.1016/j.canlet.2014.12.013,Cancer Letters
A Novel Signature For Predicting Prognosis And Immune Landscape In Cutaneous Melanoma Based On Anoikis-Related Long Non-Coding Rnas,"Anoikis is a unique form of apoptosis associated with vascularization and distant metastasis in cancer. Eliminating anoikis resistance in tumor cells could be a promising target for improving the prognosis of terminal cancer patients. However, current studies have not elaborated on the prognosis effect of anoikis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous melanoma. Pre-processed data, including RNA sequences and clinical information, were retrieved from TCGA and GTEx databases. After a series of statistical analyses, anoikis-related lncRNAs with prognostic significance were identified, and a unique risk signature was constructed. Risk scores were further analyzed in relation to the tumor microenvironment, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, immune checkpoint genes, and RNA methylation genes. The indicators were also used to predict the potentially sensitive anti-cancer drugs. An anoikis-related lncRNAs risk signature consisting of LINC01711, POLH-AS1, MIR205HG, and LINC02416 was successfully established in cutaneous melanoma. Overall survival and progression-free survival of patients were strongly linked with the risk score, independently of other clinical factors. The low-risk group exhibited a more beneficial immunological profile, was less affected by RNA methylation, and was more sensitive to the majority of anti-cancer drugs, all of which indicated a better prognostic outcome. The 4 hub lncRNAs may be fundamental to studying the mechanism of anoikis in cutaneous melanoma and provide personalized therapy for salvaging drug resistance.","Zhang M., Zuo Y., Guo J., Yang L., Wang Y., Tan M., Guo X.",10.1038/s41598-023-39837-5,Scientific Reports
Targeting Metabolic Plasticity And Flexibility Dynamics For Cancer Therapy,"Cancer cells continuously rewire their metabolism to fulfill their need for rapid growth and survival while subject to changes in environmental cues. Thus, a vital component of a cancer cell lies in its metabolic adaptability. The constant demand for metabolic alterations requires flexibility, that is, the ability to utilize different metabolic substrates; as well as plastic-ity, that is, the ability to process metabolic substrates in different ways. In this review, we discuss how dynamic changes in cancer metabolism affect tumor progression and the consequential implications for cancer therapy. significance: Recognizing cancer dynamic metabolic adaptability as an entity can lead to targeted therapy that is expected to decrease drug resistance.","Fendt S.-M., Frezza C., Erez A.",10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0844,Cancer Discovery
Tumor-Derived Exosomes: The Emerging Orchestrators In Melanoma,"Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer type derived from melanocytes and its incidence has rapidly increased worldwide. Despite the vast improvement in therapy, melanoma is still confronted with high invasion, metastasis, and recurrence rate. Recent studies have confirmed that the exosomes are naturally occurring membranous extracellular vesicles with nano-sized lipid bilayers, performing as information messagers within cellular reciprocal action. Exosomes are unquestionably endowed with multifaceted roles in various diseases, including melanoma. Notably, tumor-derived exosomes play a pivotal role in conditioning the tumor microenvironment to promote the growth, metastasis, immune escape, and even drug-resistance of melanoma by transferring carcinogenic nucleic acids and proteins. Clinically, the dynamic expressions of exosomal components and loadings in melanoma patients with different tumor stages confer the clinical application of melanoma exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers. Hence, this review highlights the recent complicated roles and mechanisms of melanoma exosomes, as well as their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in melanoma. The in-depth insights into the properties and behaviors of melanoma exosomes are of great potential to yield attractive therapeutic methods for melanoma.","Tan Y., Tang F., Li J., Yu H., Wu M., Wu Y., Zeng H., Hou K., Zhang Q.",10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112832,Biomedicine And Pharmacotherapy
The Mir-31-Sox10 Axis Regulates Tumor Growth And Chemotherapy Resistance Of Melanoma Via Pi3K/Akt Pathway,"MicroRNAs were thought to play a regulatory role through complementarity to target messenger RNA (mRNA). Our previous study revealed a miR-31-SOX10 axis that regulated tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy of melanoma. Up-regulation of SOX10 and down-regulation of miR-31 were found in melanoma tissues. SOX10 was further identified as a target of miR-31. Overexpression of SOX10 dramatically promoted melanoma cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. While enforced miR-31 expression suppressed cell growth and enhanced the chemosensitivity of melanoma cells, the re-expression of SOX10 rescued these effects by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that SOX10 acted as an oncogene and was negatively regulated by miR-31, which supports the potential therapeutic strategy against melanoma by targeting the miR-31-SOX10 axis.","Zheng Y., Sun Y., Liu Y., Zhang X., Li F., Li L., Wang J.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.175,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
Interactions Of Microplastics And Soil Pollutants In Soil-Plant Systems,"In recent years, increasing studies have been reported on characterization and detection of microplastics (MPs), and their interactions with organic pollutants (OPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in soils. However, a comprehensive review on the characteristics and factors that influence MPs distribution in soils, the sorption characteristics and mechanisms of soil contaminants by MPs, especially the interactions of MPs and their complexes with pollutants in the soil-plant systems remains rarely available at present. This review focuses on the sorption features and mechanisms of pollutants by MPs in soil and discussed the effects of MPs and their complexing with pollutants on soil properties, microbe and plants. The polarity of MPs significantly influenced the sorption of OPs, and different sorption mechanisms are involved for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic OPs. The sorption of OPs on MPs in soils is different from that in water. Aging of MPs can promote the sorption and migration of contaminants. The enhanced effects of biofilm in microplastisphere on the sorption of pollutants by MPs are critical, and interactions of soil environment-MPs-microbe-HMs-antibiotics increase the potential pathogens and larger release of resistance genes. The coexistence of HMs and MPs affected the growth of plants and the uptake of HMs and MPs by the plants. Moreover, the type, dose, shape and particle size of MPs have important influences on their interactions with pollutants and subsequent effects on soil properties, microbial activities and plant growth. This review also pointed out some knowledge gaps and constructive countermeasures to promote future research in this field.","He S., Wei Y., Yang C., He Z.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120357,Environmental Pollution
Sex-Specific Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastic And Lead(Ii) Co-Exposure On The Gut Microbiome And Fecal Metabolome In C57Bl/6 Mice,"The wide spread of microplastics has fueled growing public health concern globally. Due to their porous structure and large surface area, microplastics can serve as carriers for other environmental pollutants, including heavy metals. Although the toxic effects of microplastics or heavy metals have been reported previously, investigations into the sex-differential health effects of combined exposure to microplastics and heavy metals are lacking. In the present study, the effects of polystyrene microplastics and lead(II) co-exposure on the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, and fecal metabolome were examined in both male and female mice. Combined exposure of polystyrene microplastics and lead(II) increased intestinal permeability in both male and female mice. Sex-specific responses to the co-exposure were found in gut bacteria, fungi, microbial metabolic pathways, microbial genes encoding antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, as well as fecal metabolic profiles. In particular, Shannon and Simpson indices of gut bacteria were reduced by the co-exposure only in female mice. A total of 34 and 13 fecal metabolites were altered in the co-exposure group in female and male mice, respectively, among which only three metabolites were shared by both sexes. These sex-specific responses to the co-exposure need to be taken into consideration when investigating the combined toxic effects of microplastics and heavy metals on the gut microbiota.","Shen W., Zhao M., Xu W., Shi X., Ren F., Tu P., Gao N., Shan J., Gao B.",10.3390/metabo14040189,Metabolites
"Do Contaminants Compromise The Use Of Recycled Nutrients In Organic Agriculture? A Review And Synthesis Of Current Knowledge On Contaminant Concentrations, Fate In The Environment And Risk Assessment","Use of nutrients recycled from societal waste streams in agriculture is part of the circular economy, and in line with organic farming principles. Nevertheless, diverse contaminants in waste streams create doubts among organic farmers about potential risks for soil health. Here, we gather the current knowledge on contaminant levels in waste streams and recycled nutrient sources, and discuss associated risks. For potentially toxic elements (PTEs), the input of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) from mineral feed supplements remains of concern, while concentrations of PTEs in many waste streams have decreased substantially in Europe. The same applies to organic contaminants, although new chemical groups such as flame retardants are of emerging concern and globally contamination levels differ strongly. Compared to inorganic fertilizers, application of organic fertilizers derived from human or animal feces is associated with an increased risk for environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance. The risk depends on the quality of the organic fertilizers, which varies between geographical regions, but farmland application of sewage sludge appears to be a safe practice as shown by some studies (e.g. from Sweden). Microplastic concentrations in agricultural soils show a wide spread and our understanding of its toxicity is limited, hampering a sound risk assessment. Methods for assessing public health risks for organic contaminants must include emerging contaminants and potential interactions of multiple compounds. Evidence from long-term field experiments suggests that soils may be more resilient and capable to degrade or stabilize pollutants than often assumed. In view of the need to source nutrients for expanding areas under organic farming, we discuss inputs originating from conventional farms vs. non-agricultural (i.e. societal) inputs. Closing nutrient cycles between agriculture and society is feasible in many cases, without being compromised by contaminants, and should be enhanced, aided by improved source control, waste treatment and sound risk assessments.","Bünemann E.K., Reimer M., Smolders E., Smith S.R., Bigalke M., Palmqvist A., Brandt K.K., Möller K., Harder R., Hermann L., Speiser B., Oudshoorn F., Løes A.K., Magid J.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168901,Science Of The Total Environment
Long-Term And Rapid Evolution In Powdery Mildew Fungi,"The powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphaceae) are globally distributed plant pathogens with a range of more than 10,000 plant hosts. In this review, we discuss the long- and short-term evolution of these obligate biotrophic fungi and outline their diversity with respect to morphology, lifestyle, and host range. We highlight their remarkable ability to rapidly overcome plant immunity, evolve fungicide resistance, and broaden their host range, for example, through adaptation and hybridization. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics, particularly in cereal powdery mildews (genus Blumeria), provided first insights into mechanisms of genomic adaptation in these fungi. Transposable elements play key roles in shaping their genomes, where even close relatives exhibit diversified patterns of recent and ongoing transposon activity. These transposons are ubiquitously distributed in the powdery mildew genomes, resulting in a highly adaptive genome architecture lacking obvious regions of conserved gene space. Transposons can also be neofunctionalized to encode novel virulence factors, particularly candidate secreted effector proteins, which may undermine the plant immune system. In cereals like barley and wheat, some of these effectors are recognized by plant immune receptors encoded by resistance genes with numerous allelic variants. These effectors determine incompatibility (""avirulence"") and evolve rapidly through sequence diversification and copy number variation. Altogether, powdery mildew fungi possess plastic genomes that enable their fast evolutionary adaptation towards overcoming plant immunity, host barriers, and chemical stress such as fungicides, foreshadowing future outbreaks, host range shifts and expansions as well as potential pandemics by these pathogens.","Kusch S., Qian J., Loos A., Kümmel F., Spanu P.D., Panstruga R.",10.1111/mec.16909,Molecular Ecology
Usp18 Enhances The Resistance Of Braf-Mutated Melanoma Cells To Vemurafenib By Stabilizing Cgas Expression To Induce Cell Autophagy,"This study aims to discern the possible molecular mechanism of the effect of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) on the resistance to BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma by regulating cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). The cancer tissues of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients before and after vemurafenib treatment were collected, in which the protein expression of USP18 and cGAS was determined. A BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma cell line (A2058R) resistant to vemurafenib was constructed with its viability, apoptosis, and autophagy detected following overexpression and depletion assays of USP18 and cGAS. Xenografted tumors were transplanted into nude mice for in vivo validation. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of cGAS was positively correlated with USP18 in melanoma, and USP18 was highly expressed in melanoma. The expression of cGAS and USP18 was up-regulated in cancer tissues of vemurafenib-resistant patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. Knockdown of cGAS inhibited the resistance to vemurafenib in A2058R cells and the protective autophagy induced by vemurafenib in vitro. USP18 could deubiquitinate cGAS to promote its protein stability. In vivo experimentations confirmed that USP18 promoted vemurafenib-induced protective autophagy by stabilizing cGAS protein, which promoted resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells. Collectively, USP18 stabilizes cGAS protein expression through deubiquitination and induces autophagy of melanoma cells, thereby promoting the resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma.","Ma Z.-R., Xiong Q.-W., Cai S.-Z., Ding L.-T., Yin C.-H., Xia H.-L., Liu W., Dai S., Zhang Y., Zhu Z.-H., Huang Z.-J., Wang Q., Yan X.-M.",10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110617,International Immunopharmacology
Advances With Antibody-Drug Conjugates In Breast Cancer Treatment,"Antibody-drug conjugate-based therapy for treatment of cancer has attracted much attention because of its enhanced efficacy against numerous cancer types. Commonly, an ADC includes a mAb linked to a therapeutic payload. Antibody, linker and payload are the three main components of ADCs. The high specificity of antibodies is integrated with the strong potency of payloads in ADCs. ADCs with potential cytotoxic small molecules as payloads, generate antibody-mediated cancer therapy. Recently, ADCs with DNA-damaging agents have shown favor over microtubule-targeting agents as payloads. Although ADC resistance can be a barrier to effectiveness, several ADC therapies have been either approved or are in clinical trials for cancer treatment. The ADC-based treatments of breast cancers, particularly TNBC, MDR and metastatic breast cancers, have shown promise in recent years. This review discusses ADC drug designs, and developed for different types of breast cancer including TNBC, MDR and metastatic breast cancer.","Abdus Subhan M., Torchilin V.P.",10.1016/j.ejpb.2021.10.016,European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics
Trail Receptor-Induced Features Of Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition Increase Tumour Phenotypic Heterogeneity: Potential Cell Survival Mechanisms,"The continuing efforts to exploit the death receptor agonists, such as the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), for cancer therapy, have largely been impaired by the anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signalling pathways leading to drug resistance. Cell migration, invasion, differentiation, immune evasion and anoikis resistance are plastic processes sharing features of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that have been shown to give cancer cells the ability to escape cell death upon cytotoxic treatments. EMT has recently been suggested to drive a heterogeneous cellular environment that appears favourable for tumour progression. Recent studies have highlighted a link between EMT and cell sensitivity to TRAIL, whereas others have highlighted their effects on the induction of EMT. This review aims to explore the molecular mechanisms by which death signals can elicit an increase in response heterogeneity in the metastasis context, and to evaluate the impact of these processes on cell responses to cancer therapeutics.","Peyre L., Meyer M., Hofman P., Roux J.",10.1038/s41416-020-01177-w,British Journal Of Cancer
"Antibacterial Amino Acid-Based Poly(Ionic Liquid) Membranes: Effects Of Chirality, Chemical Bonding Type, And Application For Mrsa Skin Infections","Bacteria induced infection remains a serious medical hazard to humans. Antibacterial polymeric materials, which can kill or inhibit bacteria by disrupting cell membranes, inhibiting certain enzymes, or interfering with the transcription or synthesis of DNA or RNA, have been applied to reduce or inhibit microbial drug resistance. Herein, amino acid-based ionic liquids (ILs) and poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) membranes were synthesized and used as antibacterial materials to treat skin wounds infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The effects of chirality (D- or L-enantiomers) and chemical bonding (ionic or covalent) of the amino acid groups attached to the IL (or PIL) on antibacterial properties were investigated. Both the ILs and PIL membranes containing D-enantiomeric amino acid groups exhibited higher antibacterial activities compared with those containing L-enantiomeric amino acids. In addition, the ionically-bonded PIL membranes showed higher antibacterial activities than the corresponding covalently-bonded polymeric membranes. These results indicate that both the chirality and chemical bonding type of amino acid groups affect the antimicrobial activity of the PIL membranes. Additionally, the amino acid-based PIL membranes accelerated the wound-healing process, alleviated local tissue inflammation, and reduced the influence of bacteria on vital organs (liver and spleen) in MRSA-infected mouse models, demonstrating the potential applications for antimicrobial wound dressing.","Guo J., Qian Y., Sun B., Sun Z., Chen Z., Mao H., Wang B., Yan F.",10.1021/acsabm.9b00619,Acs Applied Bio Materials
Challenges And Innovations In Treating Chronic And Acute Wound Infections: From Basic Science To Clinical Practice,"Acute and chronic wound infection has become a major worldwide healthcare burden leading to significantly high morbidity and mortality. The underlying mechanism of infections has been widely investigated by scientist, while standard wound management is routinely been used in general practice. However, strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of wound infections remain a great challenge due to the occurrence of biofilm colonization, delayed healing and drug resistance. In the present review, we summarize the common microorganisms found in acute and chronic wound infections and discuss the challenges from the aspects of clinical diagnosis, non-surgical methods and surgical methods. Moreover, we highlight emerging innovations in the development of antimicrobial peptides, phages, controlled drug delivery, wound dressing materials and herbal medicine, and find that sensitive diagnostics, combined treatment and skin microbiome regulation could be future directions in the treatment of wound infection.","Ding X., Tang Q., Xu Z., Xu Y., Zhang H., Zheng D., Wang S., Tan Q., Maitz J., Maitz P.K., Yin S., Wang Y., Chen J.",10.1093/burnst/tkac014,Burns And Trauma
Phenotypic Heterogeneity And Evolution Of Melanoma Cells Associated With Targeted Therapy Resistance,"Phenotypic plasticity is associated with non-genetic drug tolerance in several cancers. Such plasticity can arise from chromatin remodeling, transcriptomic reprogramming, and/or protein signaling rewiring, and is characterized as a cell state transition in response to molecular or physical perturbations. This, in turn, can confound interpretations of drug responses and resistance development. Using BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines as the prototype, we report on a joint theoretical and experimental investigation of the cell-state transition dynamics associated with BRAF inhibitor drug tolerance. Thermodynamically motivated surprisal analysis of transcriptome data was used to treat the cell population as an entropy maximizing system under the influence of time-dependent constraints. This permits the extraction of an epigenetic potential landscape for drug-induced phenotypic evolution. Single-cell flow cytometry data of the same system were modeled with a modified Fokker-Planck-type kinetic model. The two approaches yield a consistent picture that accounts for the phenotypic heterogeneity observed over the course of drug tolerance development. The results reveal that, in certain plastic cancers, the population heterogeneity and evolution of cell phenotypes may be understood by accounting for the competing interactions of the epigenetic potential landscape and state-dependent cell proliferation. Accounting for such competition permits accurate, experimentally verifiable predictions that can potentially guide the design of effective treatment strategies.","Su Y., Bintz M., Yang Y., Robert L., Ng A.H.C., Liu V., Ribas A., Heath J.R., Wei W.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007034,Plos Computational Biology
Immunosuppressive Regulatory Cells In Cancer Immunotherapy: Restrain Or Modulate?,"Immunosuppressive regulatory cells (IRCs) play important roles in negatively regulating immune response, and are mainly divided into myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Large numbers of preclinical and clinical studies have shown that inhibition or reduction of IRCs could effectively elevate antitumor immune responses. However, several studies also reported that excessive inhibition of IRCs function is one of the main reasons causing the side effects of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the reasonable regulation of IRCs is crucial for improving the safety and efficiency of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we summarised the recent research advances in the cancer immunotherapy by regulating the proportion of IRCs, and discussed the roles of IRCs in regulating tumour immune evasion and drug resistance to immunotherapies. Furthermore, we also discussed how to balance the potential opportunities and challenges of using IRCs to improve the safety of cancer immunotherapies.","Wu Y., Chen D., Gao Y., Xu Q., Zhou Y., Ni Z., Na M.",10.1007/s13577-024-01083-w,Human Cell
Phosphorylation Of Ezh2 Differs Her2-Positive Breast Cancer Invasiveness In A Site-Specific Manner,"HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) invasiveness and drug-resistance issue is the critical treatment obstacle recently. We investigated the total and phosphorylated status EZH2 expression in database and BC tissue microarray. We demonstrated for the first time that EZH2 is distributed both in cytoplasm and nucleus of breast cancer cells in a phosphorylation site-specific manner. High expressed-EZH2 cases more frequently had an advanced clinical stage (lymph node metastasis) and aggressive features than EZH2-low cases, potentially indicating the high risk of HER2-positive BC (p < 0.05). Notably, highly expressed phosphorylated EZH2 is differently located in cytoplasm or nucleus in a site-specific manner in breast cancer cells. Nucleus-located pEZH2-S21 is expressed in invasive and lymph node metastatic HER2-positive BC cases (p = 0.144, p = 0.001). Cytoplasmic pEZH2-T487 is correlated with HER2 positive status (p = 0.014). In conclusion, high expression of nucleus-located EZH2 might be a predictor of invasive BC. Activation of phosphorylated EZH2-S21 site in nucleus would be a potential predictor of HER2-positve BC and poor efficacy of HER2-target therapy. These results point to a PRC2-independent non-epigenetic mechanism and therapeutic strategy of EZH2 in HER2-positive BC.","Yu F., Li L., Zhang M., Sun S.",10.1186/s12885-023-11450-9,Bmc Cancer
Antibiofilm Effect Of Curcumin Against Staphylococcus Aureus Surface Wound Biofilm–Associated Infection: In Vitro And In Silico,"Biofilm is the consortia of the sessile group of microbial species that are adhered to the biotic and abiotic surfaces with the help of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and glycocalyx. A wound is a lesion on the epidermal surface that exposes the underlying tissues to the external environment and thus forms a region of proliferation for several species of Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is the most commonly observed nosocomial biofilm-forming organism that is responsible for the development of wound-associated infections. The biofilm prevents the penetration of the drug molecules thereby resulting in the development of antibiotic and multi-drug resistance among the organism. Thus, the use of alternative therapeutics has paved the path in the treatment of biofilm-associated infections. Curcumin has been used for the purpose of treating various illnesses from time immemorial. In this study, we observed that curcumin was able to bring about a reduction in the biofilm formed by S. aureus in the wound infection among the patients. The in silico studies revealed that curcumin possessed the ability to bring about interaction with the biofilm-forming proteins of S. aureus effectively.","Gao K., Zhang B., Zhao F.",10.1007/s12010-022-03844-5,Applied Biochemistry And Biotechnology

We analyzed the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib on β-catenin and E-cadherin expression in SCC with respect to human papillomavirus (HPV) status. Materials and Methods: Expression of β-catenin and E-cadherin in cell lines UMSCC 11A, UMSCC 14C and CERV196 under the influence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

As liquid biopsy has enabled us to diagnose and monitor disease status less invasively, substantial attention has been directed toward this technique, which is gaining importance as a diagnostic and/or prognostic tool. It is evident that microRNA, cell-free DNA, and circulating tumor cells obtained via liquid biopsy are promising diagnostic and prognostic tools for melanoma, and they also have utility for monitoring the disease status and predicting drug effects. Although current challenges exist for each biomarker, such as poor sensitivity and/or specificity and technical problems, recent technical advances have increasingly improved these aspects. For example, next-generation sequencing technology for detecting microRNAs or cell-free DNA enabled high-throughput analysis and provided significantly higher sensitivity. In particular, cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing for quantifying cell-free DNA is a promising method for high-throughput analysis that provides real-time comprehensive data for patients at various disease stages. For wide clinical implementation, it is necessary to increase the sensitivity for the markers and standardize the assay procedures to make them reproducible, valid, and inexpensive; however, the broad clinical application of liquid biopsy could occur quickly. This review focuses on the significance of liquid biopsy, particularly related to the use of blood samples from patients with melanoma, and discusses its future perspectives.","Kanemaru H., Mizukami Y., Kaneko A., Kajihara I., Fukushima S.",10.1007/s11864-022-00948-2,Current Treatment Options In Oncology
Immunogenicity Of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Recombinant B-Type Fagellin As A Vaccine Candidate: Protective Efficacy In A Murine Burn Wound Sepsis Model,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a formidable opportunistic pathogen among patients with burn wound infections. Antimicrobial therapy is often unsuccessful because PA can develop multi-drug resistance; thus, immunotherapy can be a rational alternative. The goal of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity recombinant type b flagellin (r-b-flagellin) as a potential vaccine against P. aeruginosa in a mouse model for burn wound sepsis. Primary immunization with r-b-flagellin (10. μg) followed by two booster shots was sufficient to generate a robust humoral response, which was predominantly a T helper 2 (Th2) type response consisting mainly of subtype IgG1 and low levels of IgG2a. Analysis of the Th1-Th2 response among immunized mice showed an increased production of IL-4, INF-γ and IL-17 by splenocytes upon stimulation by r-b-flagellin. Opsono-phagocytosis assays confirmed the enhanced killing of bacteria by anti r-b-flagellin immune sera. These antibodies were also able to inhibit motility of P. aeruginosa and afforded protection to immunized mice by reducing bacterial load in the site of original infection into the liver of challenged mice. The reduction of systemic bacterial spread resulted in an increase in the survival rate of challenged immunized mice. In conclusion, immunization of mice with r-b-flagellin protein increased the level of humoral and cellular immune response and led to an efficacious protection against P. aeruginosa infection in the burn mouse model.","Behrouz B., Mahdavi M., Amirmozafari N., Fatemi M.J., Irajian G., Bahroudi M., Hashemi F.B.",10.1016/j.burns.2016.03.015,Burns
Sox2 As A Novel Contributor Of Oxidative Metabolism In Melanoma Cells,"Background: Deregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and recent evidence underlines that targeting tumor energetics may improve therapy response and patient outcome. Despite the general attitude of cancer cells to exploit the glycolytic pathway even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis or ""Warburg effect""), tumor metabolism is extremely plastic, and such ability to switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) allows cancer cells to survive under hostile microenvironments. Recently, OxPhos has been related with malignant progression, chemo-resistance and metastasis. OxPhos is induced under extracellular acidosis, a well-known characteristic of most solid tumors, included melanoma. Methods: To evaluate whether SOX2 modulation is correlated with metabolic changes under standard or acidic conditions, SOX2 was silenced and overexpressed in several melanoma cell lines. To demonstrate that SOX2 directly represses HIF1A expression we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assay. Results: In A375-M6 melanoma cells, extracellular acidosis increases SOX2 expression, that sustains the oxidative cancer metabolism exploited under acidic conditions. By studying non-acidic SSM2c and 501-Mel melanoma cells (high- and very low-SOX2 expressing cells, respectively), we confirmed the metabolic role of SOX2, attributing SOX2-driven OxPhos reprogramming to HIF1α pathway disruption. Conclusions: SOX2 contributes to the acquisition of an aggressive oxidative tumor phenotype, endowed with enhanced drug resistance and metastatic ability.","Andreucci E., Pietrobono S., Peppicelli S., Ruzzolini J., Bianchini F., Biagioni A., Stecca B., Calorini L.",10.1186/s12964-018-0297-z,Cell Communication And Signaling
Dual Disruption Of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases 1 And 3 Promotes Functional Changes In The Glutathione Redox System And Enhances Chemosensitivity In Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer,"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are multifunctional enzymes that oxidize diverse endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. We conducted a meta-analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus data and detected genetic alterations in ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1, 86% of which were gene amplification or mRNA upregulation, in 31% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The expression of these isoenzymes impacted chemoresistance and shortened survival times in patients. We hypothesized that these enzymes provide an oxidative advantage for the persistence of NSCLC. To test this hypothesis, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches with DIMATE, an irreversible inhibitor of ALDH1/3. DIMATE showed cytotoxicity in 73% of NSCLC cell lines tested and demonstrated antitumor activity in orthotopic xenografts via hydroxynonenal-protein adduct accumulation, GSTO1-mediated depletion of glutathione and increased H(2)O(2). Consistent with this result, ALDH1/3 disruption synergized with ROS-inducing agents or glutathione synthesis inhibitors to trigger cell death. In lung cancer xenografts with high to moderate cisplatin resistance, combination treatment with DIMATE promoted strong synergistic responses with tumor regression. These results indicate that NSCLCs with increased expression of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, or ALDH3A1 may be targeted by strategies involving inhibitors of these isoenzymes as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy to overcome patient-specific drug resistance.","Rebollido-Rios R., Venton G., Sánchez-Redondo S., Iglesias I Felip C., Fournet G., González E., Romero Fernández W., Borroto Escuela D.O., Di Stefano B., Penarroche-Díaz R., Martin G., Ceylan I., Costello R., Perez-Alea M.",10.1038/s41388-020-1184-9,Oncogene
Molecular Landmarks Of Tumor Disulfidptosis Across Cancer Types To Promote Disulfidptosis-Target Therapy,"The mystery about the mechanistic basis of disulfidptosis has recently been unraveled and shows promise as an effective treatment modality for triggering cancer cell death. However, the limited understanding of the role of disulfidptosis in tumor progression and drug sensitivity has hindered the development of disulfidptosis-targeted therapy and combinations with other therapeutic strategies. Here, we established a disulfidptosis signature model to estimate tumor disulfidptosis status in approximately 10,000 tumor samples across 33 cancer types and revealed its prognostic value. Then, we characterized disulfidptosis-associated molecular features and identified various types of molecular alterations that correlate with both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive responses to anti-tumor drugs. We further showed the vast heterogeneity in disulfidptosis status among 760 cancer cell lines across 25 cancer types. We experimentally validated that disulfidptosis score-high cell lines are more susceptible to glucose starvation-induced disulfidptosis compared to their counterparts with low scores. Finally, we investigated the impact of disulfidptosis status on drug response and revealed that disulfidptosis induction may enhance sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, but in some cases, it could also lead to drug resistance in cultured cells. Overall, our multi-omics analysis firstly elucidates a comprehensive profile of disulfidptosis-related molecular alterations, prognosis, and potential therapeutic therapies at a pan-cancer level. These findings may uncover opportunities to utilize multiple drug sensitivities induced by disulfidptosis, thereby offering practical implications for clinical cancer therapy.","Zhao D., Meng Y., Dian Y., Zhou Q., Sun Y., Le J., Zeng F., Chen X., He Y., Deng G.",10.1016/j.redox.2023.102966,Redox Biology
Soil Contamination In Nearby Natural Areas Mirrors That In Urban Greenspaces Worldwide,"Soil contamination is one of the main threats to ecosystem health and sustainability. Yet little is known about the extent to which soil contaminants differ between urban greenspaces and natural ecosystems. Here we show that urban greenspaces and adjacent natural areas (i.e., natural/semi-natural ecosystems) shared similar levels of multiple soil contaminants (metal(loid)s, pesticides, microplastics, and antibiotic resistance genes) across the globe. We reveal that human influence explained many forms of soil contamination worldwide. Socio-economic factors were integral to explaining the occurrence of soil contaminants worldwide. We further show that increased levels of multiple soil contaminants were linked with changes in microbial traits including genes associated with environmental stress resistance, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis. Taken together, our work demonstrates that human-driven soil contamination in nearby natural areas mirrors that in urban greenspaces globally, and highlights that soil contaminants have the potential to cause dire consequences for ecosystem sustainability and human wellbeing.","Liu Y.-R., Van Der Heijden M.G.A., Riedo J., Sanz-Lazaro C., Eldridge D.J., Bastida F., Moreno-Jiménez E., Zhou X.-Q., Hu H.-W., He J.-Z., Moreno J.L., Abades S., Alfaro F., Bamigboye A.R., Berdugo M., Blanco-Pastor J.L., De Los Ríos A., Duran J., Grebenc T., Illán J.G., Makhalanyane T.P., Molina-Montenegro M.A., Nahberger T.U., Peñaloza-Bojacá G.F., Plaza C., Rey A., Rodríguez A., Siebe C., Teixido A.L., Casado-Coy N., Trivedi P., Torres-Díaz C., Verma J.P., Mukherjee A., Zeng X.-M., Wang L., Wang J., Zaady E., Zhou X., Huang Q., Tan W., Zhu Y.-G., Rillig M.C., Delgado-Baquerizo M.",10.1038/s41467-023-37428-6,Nature Communications
Cost-Effectiveness Of A Bone Substitute Delivering Gentamicin In The Treatment Of Chronic Osteomyelitis Of Long Bones: Protocol For The Conviction Randomized Multicenter Study,"Introduction: Chronic osteomyelitis is a serious osteoarticular infection that most often occurs in the long bones, responsible for significant morbidity with the risk of fracture and amputation. Despite advances in both antibiotics and surgical treatment, the probability of recurrence of infection remains at around 20%. Cerament-G (BONESUPPORT AB, Sweden) is a synthetic bone substitute that fills the bone void left by surgery, prevents infection and promotes bone regeneration within this space. Cerament-G also provides the local delivery of high doses of gentamicin over several weeks. Two prospective observational studies described a number of infectious recurrences of 4 and 5% after the use of Cerament-G. Although available in France, Cerament-G is currently not reimbursed and its high cost constitutes a barrier to its use. We hypothesize that the use of Cerament-G will lead to fewer costs to the collectivity while improving patient utility and, as an innovative strategy, will be superior to standard of care on recurrence of infection. Methods and analysis: The Conviction Study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single blind study conducted in 14 French Reference Centers for Complex Osteoarticular infections. The main objective is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using Cerament-G in the treatment of chronic long bone osteomyelitis by comparing this innovative strategy to standard of care. A cost-utility analysis from the collective perspective will be conducted over a 24-month time horizon after the initial surgery. The outcome for the main medico-economic evaluation will be Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Discussion: The study is being conducted throughout the CRIOAc network in France, in referral centers for the management of complex infections which will facilitate patient recruitment. This study has several limitations: the investigators have to be trained to handle the device, and it was impossible to blind the surgeon. Conclusion: If the use of Cerament-G is demonstrated to be superior to leaving the dead space empty during surgery for patients with stage III chronic long bone osteomyelitis, its use will be recommended to improve the prognosis of such patients, and this device may eventually qualify for reimbursement through the French Health Insurance scheme. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol received authorization from the Ethics Committee CPP Sud Méditerranée V on April 27, 2021 (21.03.10.77652) and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products on May 6, 2021 (2020-A02299-30).

Microplastics In The Environment: Interactions With Microbes And Chemical Contaminants,"Microplastics (MPs) are contaminants of emerging concern that have gained considerable attention during the last few decades due to their adverse impact on living organisms and the environment. Recent studies have shown their ubiquitous presence in the environment including the atmosphere, soil, and water. Though several reviews have focused on the occurrence of microplastics in different habitats, little attention has been paid to their interaction with biological and chemical pollutants in the environment. This review therefore presents the state of knowledge on the interaction of MPs with chemicals and microbes in different environments. The distribution of MPs, the association of toxic chemicals with MPs, microbial association with MPs and the microbial-induced fate of MPs in the environment are discussed. The biodegradation and bioaccumulation of MPs by and in microbes and its potential impact on the food chain are also reviewed. The mechanisms driving these interactions and how these, in turn, affect living organisms however are not yet fully understood and require further attention.","Mammo F.K., Amoah I.D., Gani K.M., Pillay L., Ratha S.K., Bux F., Kumari S.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140518,Science Of The Total Environment
Comprehensive Assessment Of Chlorination Disinfection On Microplastic-Associated Biofilms,"Chlorination on microplastic (MP) biofilms was comprehensively investigated with respect to disinfection efficiency, morphology, and core microbiome. The experiments were performed under various conditions: i) MP particles; polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), ii) MP biofilms; Escherichia coli for single-species and river water microorganisms for multiple-species, iii) different chlorine concentrations, and iv) different chlorine exposure periods. As a result, chlorination effectively inactivated the MP biofilm microorganisms. The disinfection efficiency increased with increasing the free chlorination concentration and exposure periods for both single- and multiple-species MP biofilms. The multiple-species MP biofilms were inactivated 1.3–6.0 times less than single-species MP biofilms. In addition, the PP-MP biofilms were more vulnerable to chlorination than the PS-MP biofilms. Morphology analysis verified that chlorination detached most MP biofilms, while a small part still remained. Interestingly, chlorination strongly changed the biofilm microbiome on MPs; the relative abundance of some microbes increased after the chlorination, suggesting they could be regarded as chlorine-resistant bacteria. Some potential pathogens were also remained on the MP particles after the chlorination. Notably, chlorination was effective in inactivating the MP biofilms. Further research should be performed to evaluate the impacts of residual MP biofilms on the environment.","Thi Nguyen H., Choi W., Jeong S., Bae H., Oh S., Cho K.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134751,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
"Downregulated Ferroptosis-Related Gene Sqle Facilitates Temozolomide Chemoresistance, And Invasion And Affects Immune Regulation In Glioblastoma","Chemoresistance in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common reason hindering the success of treatment. Recently, ferroptosis has been reported to be associated with chemoresistance in different types of cancer, while the role of ferroptosis-related genes in GBM have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to demonstrate the roles and mechanism of ferroptosis-related genes in chemoresistance and metastasis of GBM. First, two candidate genes, squalene epoxidase (SQLE) and FANCD2, were identified to be associated with ferroptosis-related chemoresistance in GBM from three temozolomide (TMZ) therapeutic datasets and one ferroptosis-related gene dataset. Then, comprehensive bio-informatics data from different databases testified that SQLE was significantly downregulated both in GBM tissue and cells and displayed a better prognosis in GBM. Clinical data identified lower expression of SQLE was significantly associated with WHO grade and 1p/19q codeletion. Moreover, through in vitro experiments, SQLE was confirmed to suppress ERK-mediated TMZ chemoresistance and metastasis of GBM cells. The KEGG analysis of SQLE-associated co-expressed genes indicated SQLE was potentially involved in the cell cycle. Furthermore, SQLE was found to have the most significant correlations with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immunomodulators. These findings highlighted that SQLE could be a potential target and a biomarker for therapy and prognosis of patients with GBM.","Yao L., Li J., Zhang X., Zhou L., Hu K.",10.1111/cns.13945,Cns Neuroscience And Therapeutics
New Insights Into Small-Cell Lung Cancer Development And Therapy,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of lung cancer cases; however, it is characterized by easy relapse and low survival rate, leading to one of the most intractable diseases in clinical practice. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, little progress has been made in the management of SCLC. The current standard first-line regimens of SCLC still remain to be cisplatin or carboplatin combined with etoposide, and the adverse events of chemotherapy are by no means negligible. Besides, the immunotherapy on SCLC is still in an early stage and novel studies are urgently needed. In this review, we describe SCLC development and current therapy, aiming at providing useful advices on basic research and clinical strategy.","Wang Y., Zou S., Zhao Z., Liu P., Ke C., Xu S.",10.1002/cbin.11359,Cell Biology International
Management Of Pressure Ulcers (Pu) In Septic Children: Evaluating The Use Of Antibacterialbinding Dressings And Polyurethane Foams On Acute Wounds,"Background and Aims: Several conditions negatively influence the onset of skin breakdown in children, particularly referring to pressure ulcers (PU). Sepsis and septic conditions greatly invalidate skin integrity because all risk factors coexist: immobility, unconsciousness, critical ventilation and haemodynamic conditions, instable tissutal perfusion. More over septic patients can present dermatological manifestation according to shock etiology. The healing process itself is impaired because of the immune imbalance. This study aims at 1. Evaluating the effect of antibacterial-binding dressings on managing the bioburden of infected PU in septic children 2. Evaluating the effectiveness of polyurethane foams, used as secondary dressing, in managing pressure loads Materials and methods: Since 2018, incidence, timing of onset, bioburden, drug resistance and longitudinal course of pressure ulcers in septic patients admitted to PICU is recorded and compared to other patients admitted in the same unit. Other skin conditions together with PU management are shared in a multidisciplinary team, supported by photographic documentations. Septic children presenting PUs undergo a protocol consisting of a primary DACC binding dressing to manage the wound bioburden, in association with a secondary dressing in polyurethane foam to manage the pressure load. Results: Of 548 children admitted in PICU in 18 months, 45 present a septic state: PU incidence of 37,8%, 90,6% of not-PU wounds related to sepsis. Mean time to Cultural specimens negativization is 9.6 days in wounds treated with DACC dressings. The use of polyurethane foam lead to faster resolution ( 20,4 days) of PU and no worsening staging due to pressure persistence. Conclusions: The multidisciplinary approach based on a trained and informed team together with the combined use of DACC dressing and polyurethane foams allow a successful management of Pus and sepsis-related wounds in critical septic children by reducing bacterial and pressure burdens.","Serena C., Mauro P., Roberto B., Marina F., Charlie B., Guido C.",10.12968/jowc.2020.29.Sup7b.1,Journal Of Wound Care
Heterogeneity In Circulating Tumor Cells: The Relevance Of The Stem-Cell Subset,"The release of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into vasculature is an early event in the metastatic process. The analysis of CTCs in patients has recently received widespread attention because of its clinical implications, particularly for precision medicine. Accumulated evidence documents a large heterogeneity in CTCs across patients. Currently, the most accepted view is that tumor cells with an intermediate phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal have the highest plasticity. Indeed, the existence of a meta-stable or partial epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell state, with both epithelial and mesenchymal features, can be easily reconciled with the concept of a highly plastic stem-like state. A close connection between EMT and cancer stem cells (CSC) traits, with enhanced metastatic competence and drug resistance, has also been described. Accordingly, a subset of CTCs consisting of CSC, present a stemness profile, are able to survive chemotherapy, and generate metastases after xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. In the present review, we discuss the current evidence connecting CTCs, EMT, and stemness. An improved understanding of the CTC/EMT/CSC connections may uncover novel therapeutic targets, irrespective of the tumor type, since most cancers seem to harbor a pool of CSCs, and disclose important mechanisms underlying tumorigenicity.","Agnoletto C., Corrà F., Minotti L., Baldassari F., Crudele F., Cook W.J.J., Di Leva G., D’Adamo A.P., Gasparini P., Volinia S.",10.3390/cancers11040483,Cancers
Transcriptome Analysis Of Solute Carrier-Associated Genes In Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Friend Or Foe?,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer, and its treatment remains difficult. Since the early symptoms of HCC are not obvious, many HCC patients are already at an advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Although current targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been initially effective in HCC patients, several patients have shown low response rates or developed drug resistance, which leads to tumor progression and even death. Hence, there is an urgent need for new biomarkers to guide the prognosis and treatment of HCC. In our study, a prognostic signature consisting of nine SLC genes was constructed in HCC by comprehensive analysis. By calculating risk scores, HCC patients could be divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group having a significantly poorer prognosis. In addition, we found a hub gene, SLC7A11, which is a robust prognostic marker of HCC. In conclusion, our study can serve as a reference for the prognostic evaluation and treatment of HCC.","Wei W., Xu R., Ying X., Chen L., Lu X., Tang Q., Xie J., Yu H.",10.3389/fgene.2022.856393,Frontiers In Genetics
Methylation Modification Of Non-Histone Proteins In Breast Cancer: An Emerging Targeted Therapeutic Strategy,"Breast cancer is a major public health concern worldwide, being the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of non-histone methylation in breast cancer, which modulates the activity, interaction, localization, and stability of target proteins. This regulation affects critical processes such as oncogenesis, tumor growth, proliferation, invasion, migration, and immune responses. This review delves into the enzymes responsible for non-histone methylation, such as protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), lysine methyltransferases (KMTs), and demethylases, and explores their roles in breast cancer. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of non-histone methylation, this review aims to provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. The therapeutic potential of targeting non-histone methylation to overcome drug resistance and enhance treatment efficacy in breast cancer is also discussed, highlighting promising avenues for future research and clinical applications.","Huang M., Jiang Z., Xu Y., Wu C., Ding W., Meng X., Qian D.",10.1016/j.phrs.2024.107354,Pharmacological Research
Preoperative Treatment With Pazopanib In A Case Of Chemotherapy-Resistant Infantile Fibrosarcoma,"Clinical and radiological diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is challenging because of its similarity to vascular origin tumors. Treatment involves complete resection. Although chemotherapy may allow more conservative resection, treatment guidelines are not strictly defined. One IFS patient with an unresectable tumor had disease progression during chemotherapy. A primary tumor sample showed high VEGFR-1/2/3 and PDGFR-α/β expression. After pazopanib therapy, most tumor showed necrosis within 29 days and could be removed completely, with no relapse in 8 months post-resection. When IFS features hypervascularity, VEGFR and PDGFR expression may be high, thus allowing consideration of VEGFR inhibitors such as pazopanib.

"Rgfp966, A Histone Deacetylase 3 Inhibitor, Promotes Glioma Stem Cell Differentiation By Blocking Tgf-Β Signaling Via Smad7","Glioma stem cells (GSC) play a major role in drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Using a genetic screen with a set of shRNAs that can target chromatin regulators in a GSC model, we have HDAC3 as a major negative regulator of GSC differentiation. Inhibition of HDAC3 using a pharmacological inhibitor or a siRNA led to the induction of GSC differentiation into astrocytes. Consequently, HDAC3-inhibition also caused a strong reduction of tumor-promoting and self-renewal capabilities of GSCs. These phenotypes were highly associated with an increased acetylation of SMAD7, which protected its ubiquitination. SMAD7 inhibits a TGF-β signaling axis that is required for maintaining stemness.

Dissolving Microneedles: Standing Out In Melanoma Treatment,"Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development.","Huang J., Wang X., Li Z.",10.1039/d4tb01142b,Journal Of Materials Chemistry. B
Wnt Signaling Modulates Chemoresistance To Temozolomide In P53-Mutant Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been characterized by the high incidence, therapy tolerance and relapse. The molecular events controlling GBM resistant to chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ) remain to be elusive. Here, we identified WNT signaling was amplified by TMZ and mediated drug response in GBM. We found O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was redundant to WNT-mediated chemoresistance, which was highly associated with p53 mutation status. In GBM with p53 mutation, loss of function of p53 downregulated miR-34a expression, which represses transcription of WNT ligand 6 (WNT6) by directly binding to 3′ UTR of WNT6 mRNA, leading to activation of WNT signaling, and the eventual WNT-mediated chemoresistance to TMZ. Combined treatment of TMZ with WNT inhibitor or miR34a mimic induced drug sensitivity of p53-mutant GBM cells and extended survival in xenograft mice in vivo. Our findings provide insight into understanding the molecular mechanism of GBM chemoresistance to TMZ and facilitating to develop novel treatment strategy to combat p53-mutant GBM by targeting miR-34a/WNT6 axis.","Ma Z., Cai S., Xiong Q., Liu W., Xia H., Zhu Z., Huang Z., Yan X., Wang Q.",10.1007/s10495-021-01704-x,Apoptosis
Spatio-Genetic And Phenotypic Modelling Elucidates Resistance And Re-Sensitisation To Treatment In Heterogeneous Melanoma,"Although novel targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma, understanding and combatting drug resistance remains a major clinical challenge. Using partial differential equations, we describe the evolution of a cellular population through time, space, and phenotype dimensions, in the presence of various drug species. We then use this framework to explore models in which resistance is attained by either mutations (irreversible) or plasticity (reversible). Numerical results suggest that punctuated evolutionary assumptions are more consistent with results obtained from murine melanoma models than gradual evolution. Furthermore, in the context of an evolving tumour cell population, sequencing the treatment, for instance applying immunotherapy before BRAF inhibitors, can increase treatment effectiveness. However, drug strategies which showed success within a spatially homogeneous tumour environment were unsuccessful under heterogeneous conditions, suggesting that spatio-environmental heterogeneity may be the greatest challenge to tumour therapies. Plastic metabolic models are additionally capable of reproducing the characteristic resistant tumour volume curves and predicting re-sensitisation to secondary waves of treatment observed in patient derived xenograft (PDX) melanomas treated with MEK and BRAF inhibitors. Nevertheless, secondary relapse due to a pre-adapted subpopulation, remaining after the first wave of treatment, results in a more rapid development of resistance. Our model provides a framework through which tumour resistance can be understood and would suggest that carefully phased treatments may be able to overcome the development of long-term resistance in melanoma.","Hodgkinson A., Le Cam L., Trucu D., Radulescu O.",10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.11.037,Journal Of Theoretical Biology

The present study aimed to explore the impact of miR‑203a‑3p on bleomycin and pingyangmycin sensitivity in hemangioma, as well as the involvement of the PI3K/AKT pathway. miR‑203a‑3p or negative control mimics were transfected into human hemangioma endothelial cells, which were treated with 0‑20 µM bleomycin or pingyang‑ mycin. Subsequently, 740 Y‑P, a PI3K/AKT pathway agonist, was added. Cell viability, rate of apoptosis and the expression levels of proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway, including phosphorylated (p)‑PI3K, PI3K, p‑AKT and AKT, were detected. miR‑203a‑3p overexpression significantly decreased the half‑maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of bleomycin (5.84±0.87 vs. 14.23±2.17 µM; P<0.01) and ping‑ yangmycin (5.13±0.55 vs. 12.04±1.86 µM; P<0.01), compared with untreated cells. In addition, under bleomycin or pingyang‑ mycin treatment, miR‑203a‑3p overexpression significantly reduced the proportion of EdU positive cells (both P<0.05) and B‑cell leukemia/lymphoma‑2 (BCL2) protein expression levels (both P<0.05), whilst increasing cell apoptosis rate (both P<0.05) and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression levels (both P<0.05) compared with untreated controls. Furthermore, miR‑203a‑3p overexpression significantly inhibited the phos‑ phorylation of PI3K and AKT (both P<0.05), an effect that was significantly diminished by 740 Y‑P treatment (both P<0.01). In addition, 740 Y‑P significantly increased IC(50) values of bleomycin (P<0.01) and pingyangmycin (P<0.001) and also significantly increased the proportion of EdU‑positive cells and BCL2 protein expression levels, while decreasing the apoptosis rate and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression levels in cells treated with bleomycin or pingyangmycin (all P<0.05). Of note, 740 Y‑P weakened the effect of miR‑203a‑3p overex‑ pression on the aforementioned cellular characteristics. The present study demonstrated that miR‑203a‑3p improved the sensitivity of cells to bleomycin and pingyangmycin treatment by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling in hemangioma.","Zhuo L., Hu Z., Chang J., Guo Q., Guo J.",10.3892/etm.2024.12369,Experimental And Therapeutic Medicine
Pathogen Identification By Shotgun Metagenomics Of Patients With Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections,"Background: Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are life threatening, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Their aetiological diagnosis can be limited by poor performance of cultures and administration of antibiotics before surgery. Objectives: We aimed (i) to compare 16S-targeted metagenomics (TM) and unbiased semiquantitative panmicroorganism DNA- and RNA-based shotgun metagenomics (SM) with cultures, (ii) to identify patients who would best benefit from metagenomics approaches and (iii) to detect the microbial pathogens in surrounding non-necrotic ‘healthy’ tissues by SM-based methods. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed to assess the analytical performance of standard cultures, TM and SM on tissues from 34 patients with NSTIs. Pathogen identification obtained with these three methods was compared. Results: Thirty-four necrotic and 10 healthy tissues were collected from 34 patients. The performance of TM was inferior to that of the other methods (P < 0·05), whereas SM performed better than standard culture, although the result was not statistically significant (P = 0·08). SM was significantly more sensitive than TM for the detection of all bacteria (P = 0·02) and more sensitive than standard culture for the detection of anaerobic bacteria (P < 0·01). There was a strong correlation (r = 0·71, Spearman correlation coefficient) between the semiquantitative abundance of bacteria in the culture and the bacteria-to-human sequence ratio in SM. Low amounts of bacterial DNA were found in healthy tissues, suggesting a bacterial continuum between macroscopically ‘healthy’ and necrotic tissue. Conclusions: SM showed a significantly better ability to detect a broader range of pathogens than TM and identify strict anaerobes than standard culture. Patients with diabetes with NSTIs appeared to benefit most from SM. Finally, our results suggest a bacterial continuum between macroscopically ‘healthy’ non-necrotic areas and necrotic tissues. What's already known about this topic?. Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are characterized by rapidly progressive necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and high mortality, despite surgical debridement combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The spectrum of potentially involved pathogens is very large, and identification is often limited by the poor performance of standard cultures, which may be impaired by previous antibiotic intake. Metagenomics-based approaches show promise for better identification of the pathogens that cause these infections, but they have not been evaluated in this medical context. What does this study add?. Shotgun metagenomics (SM) showed higher sensitivity than 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a better ability than culture to detect anaerobic bacteria. As a result, a significant proportion of infections with bacteria, such as Pasteurella multocida or Clostridium perfringens, were detected only by SM. SM bacterial quantification enabled better detection of low amounts of bacterial DNA from macroscopically ‘healthy’ tissue, suggesting a subclinical infectious extension. What is the translational message?. The high analytical performance of SM shown in this study should allow its future implementation for the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, complementing or replacing routine methods. The large amount of data, including additional information on antimicrobial resistance, virulence profiles and metabolic adaptation of the pathogens, will improve microbiological documentation. Our results will improve our understanding of infectious pathophysiology in the future, leading to potentially better medical care.","Rodriguez C., Jary A., Hua C., Woerther P.-L., Bosc R., Desroches M., Sitterlé E., Gricourt G., De Prost N., Pawlotsky J.-M., Chosidow O., Sbidian E., Decousser J.-W.",10.1111/bjd.18611,British Journal Of Dermatology
Single-Cell Analysis Resolves The Cell State Transition And Signaling Dynamics Associated With Melanoma Drug-Induced Resistance,"Continuous BRAF inhibition of BRAF mutant melanomas triggers a series of cell state changes that lead to therapy resistance and escape from immune control before establishing acquired resistance genetically. We used genome-wide transcriptomics and single-cell phenotyping to explore the response kinetics to BRAF inhibition for a panel of patient-derived BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma cell lines. A subset of plastic cell lines, which followed a trajectory covering multiple known cell state transitions, provided models for more detailed biophysical investigations. Markovmodeling revealed that the cell state transitions were reversible and mediated by both Lamarckian induction and nongenetic Darwinian selection of drug-tolerant states. Single-cell functional proteomics revealed activation of certain signaling networks shortly after BRAF inhibition, and before the appearance of drug-resistant phenotypes. Drug targeting those networks, in combination with BRAF inhibition, halted the adaptive transition and led to prolonged growth inhibition in multiple patient-derived cell lines.","Su Y., Wei W., Robert L., Xue M., Tsoi J., Garcia-Diaz A., Homet Moreno B., Kim J., Ng R.H., Lee J.W., Koya R.C., Comin-Anduix B., Graeber T.G., Ribas A., Heath J.R.",10.1073/pnas.1712064115,Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America
Structural Study Of Novel Vaccinia Virus E3L And Dsrna-Dependent Protein Kinase Complex,"E3L (RNA-binding protein E3) is one of the key IFN resistance genes encoded by VV and consists of 190 amino acids with a highly conserved carboxy-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). PKR (dsRNA-dependent protein kinase) is an IFN-induced protein involved in anti-cell and antiviral activity. PKR inhibits the initiation of translation through alpha subunit of the initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α) and mediates several transcription factors such as NF-κB, p53 or STATs. Activated PKR also induces apoptosis in vaccinia virus infection. E3L is required for viral IFN resistance and directly binds to PKR to block activation of PKR. In this work, we determined the three-dimensional complex structure of E3L and PKR using cryo-EM and determined the important residues involved in the interaction. In addition, PKR peptide binds to E3L and can increase protein levels of phosphorus-PKR and phosphorus-eIF2α-induced cell apoptosis through upregulation of phosphorus-PKR in HEK293 cells. Taken together, structural insights into E3L and PKR will provide a new optimization and development of vaccinia virus drugs.","Kim H.J., Han C.W., Jeong M.S., Jang S.B.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.04.107,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
"Identification Of Setd4 As An Onco-Immunological Biomarker Encompassing The Tumor Microenvironment, Prognoses, And Therapeutic Responses In Various Human Cancers","Background: SET domain-containing protein 4 (SETD4) is a histone methyltransferase that has been shown to modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory responses by regulating histone H4 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Previous reports have demonstrated its function in the quiescence of cancer stem cells as well as drug resistance in several cancers. A limited number of systematic studies have examined SETD4's role in the tumor microenvironment, pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapeutic response. Methods: Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and other publicly accessible platforms, we comprehensively analyzed SETD4 gene expression, methylation patterns, and prognostic significance. Furthermore, we investigated its association with cancer-related pathways, the immune microenvironment, immunotherapy markers, and drug resistance signatures of chemotherapy. Additionally, qRT-PCR was performed to validate SETD4 expression in clinical specimens. Results: The expression of SETD4 was abnormal across a variety of cancer types and the expression of SETD4 in colorectal cancer tissues was verified in clinical specimens. The upregulation of SETD4 may be a prognostic risk factor predicting poor overall survival and progression-free survival. The analysis revealed that the mRNA level of SETD4 was modulated by promoter methylation, and patients with lower methylation levels showed shorter survival times. Pathway analysis showed that SETD4 influenced several key cell cycle pathways, including the G2M checkpoint, and mitotic spindle pathways. In addition, SETD4 negatively affects immune cell infiltration in most cancers, including B cells, CD8 T cells, and macrophages. The correlation between SETD4 and cancer stemness as well as homologous recombination deficiency varied across tumor types, suggesting that SETD4 may play a multifaceted role in tumor resistance. Notably, we identified several potential agents targeting SETD4. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that SETD4 is an immune-oncogenic molecule in multiple cancers, with the potential to be a diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy marker.","Zhong Y., Wang R., Huang Z., Hu Z., Peng B., Chen B., Sun L.",10.1002/iid3.70126,"Immunity, Inflammation And Disease"
A Composite Hydrogel Containing Resveratrol-Laden Nanoparticles And Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Promotes Wound Healing In Diabetic Mice,"Diabetic wounds are difficult to heal because of persistent inflammation and limited angiogenesis. Resveratrol (RES) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) are rich in growth factors and cytokines, which promote proliferation and angiogenesis. However, single drug treatment has limited efficacy and delivery efficiency. Bioengineering can improve the limited effect of single drugs by combining drugs and materials to obtain complementary or cooperative bioengineered drugs. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and silk fibroin glycidyl methacrylate (SFMA) were used to synthesize GelMA/SFMA composite hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties, swelling ratio and biodegradability. The composite hydrogel was used as a wound dressing for sustained drug release. RES was loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize MSN-RES to enhance the release dynamic, and MSN-RES and PDEVs were combined with the composite hydrogels to form GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels. The GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, inhibited macrophage iNOS expression, and promoted the tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In a diabetic mouse wound model, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and iNOS, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1 and Arg-1, promoted angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing. Interestingly, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels promoted the expression of extracellular purinergic signaling pathway-related CD73 and adenosine 2A receptor (A2A-R). Therefore, the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs hydrogels could be used as wound dressings to regulate the inflammation and angiogenesis of diabetic wounds and accelerate wound healing. Statement of significance: Drugs often fail to function because of a continuous oxidative stress microenvironment and inflammation. Here, a GelMA/SFMA hydrogel, with enhanced mechanical properties and liquid absorption ability, is proposed for sustained release of drugs. In addition to carrying platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) with pro-angiogenic effects, the hydrogels were also loaded with nanoparticle-encapsulated resveratrol with anti-inflammatory activities, aiming to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the wound microenvironment, such that the wound could receive proliferative repair signals to achieve sequential treatment and heal quickly. We also experimentally predicted that the regulatory mechanism of the GelMA/SFMA/MSN-RES/PDEVs in wound healing might be related to the extracellular purinergic signaling pathway.","Zhu W., Dong Y., Xu P., Pan Q., Jia K., Jin P., Zhou M., Xu Y., Guo R., Cheng B.",10.1016/j.actbio.2022.10.038,Acta Biomaterialia
Optimization Of Quenched Fluorescent Peptide Substrates Of Sars-Cov-2 3Cl(Pro) Main Protease (Mpro) From Proteomic Identification Of P6—P6' Active Site Specificity,"SARS-CoV-2 3C-like main protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for protein excision from the viral polyprotein. 3CL(pro) inhibitor drug development to block SARS-CoV-2 replication focuses on the catalytic non-prime (P) side for specificity and potency, but the importance of the prime (P') side in substrate specificity and for drug development remains underappreciated. We determined the P6–P6' specificity for 3CL(pro) from >800 cleavage sites that we identified using Proteomic Identification of Cleavage site Specificity (PICS). Cleavage occurred after the canonical P1-Gln and non-canonical P1-His and P1-Met residues. Moreover, P3 showed a preference for Arg/Lys and P3' for His. Essential H-bonds between the N-terminal Ser1 of protomer-B in 3CL(pro) dimers form with P1-His, but not with P1-Met. Nonetheless, cleavage occurs at P1-Met456 in native MAP4K5. Elevated reactive oxygen species in SARS-CoV-2 infection oxidize methionines. Molecular simulations revealed P1-Met(OX) forms an H-bond with Ser1 and notably, strong positive cooperativity between P1-Met with P3'-His was revealed, which enhanced peptide-cleavage rates. The highly plastic S3' subsite accommodates P3′-His that displays stabilizing backbone H-bonds with Thr25 lying central in a “‘threonine trio” (Thr24-Thr25-Thr26) in the P'-binding domain I. Molecular docking simulations unveiled structure-activity relationships impacting 3CL(pro)-substrate interactions, and the role of these structural determinants was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS cleavage assays of P1'- and P3'-positional scanning peptide libraries carrying a 2nd optimal cut-site as an internal positive control. These data informed the design of two new and highly soluble 3CL(pro)quenched-fluorescent peptide substrates for improved FRET monitoring of 3CL(pro) activity with 15× improved sensitivity over current assays.","De Jesus H.C.R., Solis N., Machado Y., Pablos I., Bell P.A., Kappelhoff R., Grin P.M., Sorgi C.A., Butler G.S., Overall C.M.",10.1128/jvi.00049-24,Journal Of Virology
A De Novo Substitution In Bcl11B Leads To Loss Of Interaction With Transcriptional Complexes And Craniosynostosis,"Craniosynostosis, the premature ossification of cranial sutures, is a developmental disorder of the skull vault, occurring in approximately 1 in 2250 births. The causes are heterogeneous, with a monogenic basis identified in ~25% of patients. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a novel, de novo variant in BCL11B, c.7C>A, encoding an R3S substitution (p.R3S), in a male patient with coronal suture synostosis. BCL11B is a transcription factor that interacts directly with the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) and polycomb-related complex 2 (PRC2) through the invariant proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7. The p.R3S substitution occurs within a conserved amino-terminal motif (RRKQxxP) of BCL11B and reduces interaction with both transcriptional complexes. Equilibrium binding studies and molecular dynamics simulations show that the p.R3S substitution disrupts ionic coordination between BCL11B and the RBBP4-MTA1 complex, a subassembly of the NuRD complex, and increases the conformational flexibility of Arg-4, Lys-5 and Gln-6 of BCL11B. These alterations collectively reduce the affinity of BCL11B p.R3S for the RBBP4-MTA1 complex by nearly an order of magnitude. We generated a mouse model of the BCL11B p.R3S substitution using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach, and we report herein that these mice exhibit craniosynostosis of the coronal suture, as well as other cranial sutures. This finding provides strong evidence that the BCL11B p.R3S substitution is causally associated with craniosynostosis and confirms an important role for BCL11B in the maintenance of cranial suture patency.","Goos J.A.C., Vogel W.K., Mlcochova H., Millard C.J., Esfandiari E., Selman W.H., Calpena E., Koelling N., Carpenter E.L., Swagemakers S.M.A., Van Der Spek P.J., Filtz T.M., Schwabe J.W.R., Iwaniec U.T., Mathijssen I.M.J., Leid M., Twigg S.R.F.",10.1093/hmg/ddz072,Human Molecular Genetics
Potential Of Natural Polysaccharide For Ovarian Cancer Therapy,"Ovarian cancer, characterized by high lethality, presents a significant clinical challenge. The standard first-line treatment is surgery and chemotherapy; however, postoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective and associated with severe side effects and the development of drug resistance. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative drug delivery strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Natural polysaccharide polymers with high bioactivity have been extensively investigated for use alone or as adjuvants to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and also for the preparation of efficient delivery systems for ovarian cancer therapy. This paper aims to review recent advances in the application of natural polysaccharides, including hyaluronic acid, chitosan, alginate, and cellulose, in the therapy of ovarian cancer. This paper primarily discusses the anti-tumor properties inherent to these natural polysaccharide polymers and offers a summary of their role in delivery systems used in ovarian cancer therapy.","Xiao M., Chen S., Yang Y., Hu K., Song Y., Hou Z., Sun S., Yang L.",10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.122946,Carbohydrate Polymers
Mycobacterium Abscessus Skin And Soft Tissue Infection Following Autologous Fat Grafting In Kurdistan Treated With An Antibiotic Combination Including Imipenem-Relebactam And Rifabutin,"Medical tourism is becoming increasingly popular.

Combined Bulk Rna And Single-Cell Rna Analyses Reveal Txnl4A As A New Biomarker For Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high mortality rate worldwide. The dysregulation of RNA splicing is a major event leading to the occurrence, progression, and drug resistance of cancer. Therefore, it is important to identify new biomarkers of HCC from the RNA splicing pathway. Methods: We performed the differential expression and prognostic analyses of RNA splicing-related genes (RRGs) using The Cancer Genome Atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-LIHC dataset was used to construct and validate prognostic models, and the PubMed database was used to explore genes in the models to identify new markers. The screened genes were subjected to genomic analyses, including differential, prognostic, enrichment, and immunocorrelation analyses. Single-cell RNA (scRNA) data were used to further validate the immunogenetic relationship. Results: Of 215 RRGs, we identified 75 differentially expressed prognosis-related genes, and a prognostic model incorporating thioredoxin like 4A (TXNL4A) was identified using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. ICGC-LIHC was used as a validation dataset to confirm the validity of the model. PubMed failed to retrieve HCC-related studies on TXNL4A. TXNL4A was highly expressed in most tumors and was associated with HCC survival. Chi-squared analyses indicated that TXNL4A expression positively correlated positively with the clinical features of HCC. Multivariate analyses revealed that high TXNL4A expression was an independent risk factor for HCC. Immunocorrelation and scRNA data analyses indicated that TXNL4A was correlated with CD8 T cell infiltration in HCC. Conclusion: Therefore, we identified a prognostic and immune-related marker for HCC from the RNA splicing pathway.","Li Y., Zhu Q., Zhou S., Chen J., Du A., Qin C.",10.3389/fonc.2023.1202732,Frontiers In Oncology
Correlating Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes And Lung Cancer Stem Cells: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Background: Lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are endowed with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression and play roles in tumor proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Their elusive nature may allow them to escape the immune response by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which can positively affect the outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Despite independent investigations on both LCSCs and TILs, the relationship between the two has been very marginally considered. We analyzed whether these two cell types may be related as a prerequisite for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, NSCLC human surgical specimens from 12 patients were tested by ALDEFLUOR assay to identify ALDH(high) cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses for CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ TILs were performed in combination with immunohistochemistry evaluation. Results: Statistically positive correlations were found between ALDH+ and CD8+, and between ALDH+ and CD3+ cells populations; no correlation was found between ALDH+ and CD4+ cells. The expression of CD3+ and CD8+ by cells accounted for 40.1% and 58.7%, respectively, of the variability of ALDH+ cell expression by an R-squared index, which highlights the strong correlation between TILs and LCSCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed 6–25% positive cells. Conclusions: We report a correlation between cytotoxic TILs and LCSCs, which may contribute to the future development of targeted therapies focusing on the different roles of lymphocytes against lung cancer.","Masciale V., Grisendi G., Banchelli F., D’Amico R., Maiorana A., Sighinolfi P., Pinelli M., Lovati E., Stefani A., Morandi U., Dominici M., Aramini B.",10.21037/atm.2019.11.27,Annals Of Translational Medicine
Myeloid Cells That Impair Immunotherapy Are Restored In Melanomas With Acquired Resistance To Braf Inhibitors,"Acquired resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibitors (BRAFi) in melanoma remains a common clinical obstacle, as is the case for any targeted drug therapy that can be developed given the plastic nature of cancers. Although there has been significant focus on the cancer cell-intrinsic properties of BRAFi resistance, the impact of BRAFi resistance on host immunity has not been explored. Here we provide preclinical evidence that resistance to BRAFi in an autochthonous mouse model of melanoma is associated with restoration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment, initially reduced by BRAFi treatment. In contrast to restoration of MDSCs, levels of T regulatory cells remained reduced in BRAFi-resistant tumors. Accordingly, tumor gene expression signatures specific for myeloid cell chemotaxis and homeostasis reappeared in BRAFi-resistant tumors. Notably, MDSC restoration relied upon MAPK pathway reactivation and downstream production of the myeloid attractant CCL2 in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. Strikingly, although combination checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1) was ineffective against BRAFi-resistant melanomas, the addition of MDSC depletion/ blockade (anti-Gr-1 + CCR2 antagonist) prevented outgrowth of BRAFi-resistant tumors. Our results illustrate how extrinsic pathways of immunosuppression elaborated by melanoma cells dominate the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need to target extrinsic as well as intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance.","Steinberg S.M., Shabaneh T.B., Zhang P., Martyanov V., Li Z., Malik B.T., Wood T.A., Boni A., Molodtsov A., Angeles C.V., Curiel T.J., Whitfield M.L., Jo Turk M.",10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1755,Cancer Research
Microrna-21 Antisense Oligonucleotide Improves The Sensitivity Of A375 Human Melanoma Cell To Cisplatin: An In Vitro Study,"This study explored Cisplatin resistance effect of microRNA-21 (miR-21) antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) in human melanoma A375 cell. AS-ODN was transfected in melanoma A375 cells and Cisplatin-resistant cell line A375/CDDP, and divided into the AS-ODN, nonsense oligonucleotide (NS-ODN) and normal groups. Cell ultrastructure changes were observed through transmission electron microscope. MiR-21 AS-ODN could be tested cell growth effect in different time periods by trypan blue exclusion. MiR-21 mRNA expression change was detected by quantitative fluorescence PCR. Cell apoptosis, cycle distribution and miR-21 AS-ODN effect on proliferation and Cisplatin sensitivity were tested by flow cytometry, MTT assay, TUNEL, and Clonogenic assay. Cell apoptosis was observed after transfection 24 h with the AS-ODN group, while the NS-ODN and normal group cells had no apoptotic symptoms; Compared with the normal group, the AS-ODN group began to show obvious cell growth inhibition effect after transfection 24 h lasting 72 h (all P < 0.05), but the NS-ODN group had no significant difference (P > 0.05). miR-21 mRNA expression in the AS-ODN group was obviously decreased with rising apoptosis rate (all P < 0.05) and there was no significant difference in the NS-ODN group (P > 0.05). MiR-21 AS-ODN could remarkably increase A375 cell and A375/CDDP cell sensitivity to Cisplatin (P < 0.05), while A375 cell sensitivity to Cisplatin between the NS-ODN group and the normal group had no difference. MiR-21 AS-ODN decreased IC(50) and increased Cisplatin sensitivity for A375 cells and A375/CDDP cells, which would be a new target of melanoma treatment.","Zhang H.-L., Si L.-B., Zeng A., Long F., Qi Z., Zhao R., Bai M.",10.1002/jcb.26455,Journal Of Cellular Biochemistry

Despite the advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy for patients with melanoma, drug resistance and low response rates pose a considerable challenge. Taxifolin is a multifunctional natural compound with emerging antitumor potentials. However, its utility in melanoma treatment remains unclear. Purpose: The study aimed to investigate the effect of purified Taxifolin from Larix olgensis roots (Changbai Mountain, China) on melanoma and explore the underlying mechanism. Methods: Purified Taxifolin from Larix olgensis roots was evaluated for its antimelanoma effects in vitro and in vivo settings. RNA-seq analysis was performed to explore the underlying mechanism. Results: Purified Taxifolin (> 99 %) from Larix olgensis roots inhibited the proliferation and migration of B16F10 melanoma cells at 200 and 400 μM, and of A375 cells at 100 and 200 μM. Taxifolin administered at 60 mg/kg suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models without causing significant toxicity.

An Integrative Pan Cancer Analysis Of Ret Aberrations And Their Potential Clinical Implications,"RET (rearranged during transfection), encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor, is a novel therapeutic target for cancers. The aberrations of RET are commonly found in cancers. Here, we profiled a comprehensive genomic landscape of RET mutations, copy number variants (CNVs), co-occurrence of RET and its mRNA expression and methylation levels in pan cancer, paving the way to the development of new RET-targeted therapies in clinic. Analysis of RET somatic mutations, CNVs, co-occurrence, mRNA expression and methylation were performed among 32 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset covering a total of 10,953 patients with 10,967 samples. RET aberrations were found in 3.0% of diverse cancers. The top two RET-altered tumors were skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) with dominant mutations in the other and PKinase_Tyr domains. RET-G823E and RET-S891L were most commonly found in SKCM and UCEC. Thyroid carcinoma (THCA) demonstrated the highest rate of coiled-coil domain containing 6 (CCDC6)-RET fusions, which constitutively activate RET kinase. Two FDA-approved RET inhibitors-pralsetinib and selpercatinib have been implied for the treatment of patients with RET S891L mutant UCEC and the treatment of patients with metastatic RET-fusion positive THCA and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at therapeutic level 1. We also identified four RET M918T-altered cases in patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), which may induce drug resistance against multikinase inhibitors. Next, 273 co-occurring aberrations, most frequently in Notch signaling, TGF-β pathway, cell cycle, and Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk/JNK signaling, were uncovered among 311 RET altered cases. TP53 mutations (162 patients) leads to the most significant co-occurrence associated with RET aberrations. Furthermore, the RET expression was found most significantly increased in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), as compared to their corresponding normal tissues. At last, patients with higher expression and sequence variant frequency have a worse prognosis, such as sarcoma patients. This work provided a profound and comprehensive analysis of RET and co-occurred alterations, RET mRNA expression and the clinical significance in pan cancer, offering new insights into targeted therapy for patients with RET anomalies.","Zhou L., Li J., Zhang X., Xu Z., Yan Y., Hu K.",10.1038/s41598-022-17791-y,Scientific Reports
Trametinib After Disease Reactivation Under Dabrafenib In Erdheim-Chester Disease With Both Braf And Kras Mutations,"Major advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) leading to novel treatment strategies. Targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibition have shown a significant impact on disease management, emphasizing the importance of the activated mitogen-associated protein kinase pathway in this disease. However, incomplete responsiveness, potentially limiting adverse effects, and the occurrence of treatment resistance to BRAF inhibition observed in other BRAF-mutant malignancies imply the importance of therapeutic strategies beyond BRAF inhibition. We report a patient with ECD who carried the BRAF(V600E) mutation and developed treatment resistance under BRAF inhibition despite initial treatment response. Genetic analyses of a newly developing ECD lesion revealed a somatic KRAS(Q61H) mutation without the presence of BRAF(V600E). Accordingly, the addition of MEK-inhibiting trametinib to BRAF-inhibiting dabrafenib was able to overcome acquired partial treatment resistance. This is the first report of treatment resistance as a result of a secondary MAPK pathway-activating mutation during BRAF inhibition in ECD. This case contributes to the ongoing efforts of simultaneous BRAF/MEK inhibition as a promising strategy in ECD.","Nordmann T.M., Juengling F.D., Recher M., Berger C.T., Kalbermatten D., Wicki A., Paasinen-Sohns A., Cathomas G., Tzankov A., Daikeler T.",10.1182/blood-2016-09-740217,Blood
Emt Signaling: Potential Contribution Of Crispr/Cas Gene Editing,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex plastic and reversible cellular process that has critical roles in diverse physiological and pathological phenomena. EMT is involved in embryonic development, organogenesis and tissue repair, as well as in fibrosis, cancer metastasis and drug resistance. In recent years, the ability to edit the genome using the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) system has greatly contributed to identify or validate critical genes in pathway signaling. This review delineates the complex EMT networks and discusses recent studies that have used CRISPR/Cas technology to further advance our understanding of the EMT process.","Mohammadinejad R., Biagioni A., Arunkumar G., Shapiro R., Chang K.-C., Sedeeq M., Taiyab A., Hashemabadi M., Pardakhty A., Mandegary A., Thiery J.-P., Aref A.R., Azimi I.",10.1007/s00018-020-03449-3,Cellular And Molecular Life Sciences
Isorhamnetin Induces Melanoma Cell Apoptosis Via The Pi3K/Akt And Nf- Κ B Pathways,"Malignant melanoma is characterized by its bad prognosis for aggressiveness, drug resistance, and early metastasis. Isorhamnetin (3′-methoxy-3,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone; IH) is a natural flavonoid that has been investigated for its antitumor effects in breast cancer, colon cancer, and gastric cancer through inducing cell apoptosis. Given its role in tumor inhibition, no research has been conducted concerning its effect against melanoma. In the present study, we found that IH could significantly inhibit B16F10 cell proliferation and migration and induce B16F10 cell apoptosis. The examination on molecular mechanism revealed that IH could suppress the phosphorylation of Akt and the translocation of NF-κB, which are key factors in apoptosis-related pathways. We also detected that this process was related to the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases 4 (PFKFB4) by PFKFB4 knockdown experiment. In line with in vitro study, we further provided that IH effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, IH was proven to induce melanoma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, which may serve as a potential agent in malignant melanoma treatment in the future.","Duan R., Liang X., Chai B., Zhou Y., Du H., Suo Y., Chen Z., Li Q., Huang X.",10.1155/2020/1057943,Biomed Research International
Identification Of A Mechanogenetic Link Between Substrate Stiffness And Chemotherapeutic Response In Breast Cancer,"Mechanical feedback from the tumor microenvironment regulates an array of processes underlying cancer biology. For example, increased stiffness of mammary extracellular matrix (ECM) drives malignancy and alters the phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Despite this link, the role of substrate stiffness in chemotherapeutic response in breast cancer remains unclear. This is complicated by routine culture and adaptation of cancer cell lines to unnaturally rigid plastic or glass substrates, leading to profound changes in their growth, metastatic potential and, as we show here, chemotherapeutic response. We demonstrate that primary breast cancer cells undergo dramatic phenotypic changes when removed from the host microenvironment and cultured on rigid surfaces, and that drug responses are profoundly altered by the mechanical feedback cells receive from the culture substrate. Conversely, primary breast cancer cells cultured on substrates mimicking the mechanics of their host tumor ECM have a similar genetic profile to the in situ cells with respect to drug activity and resistance pathways. These results suggest substrate stiffness plays a significant role in susceptibility of breast cancer to clinically-approved chemotherapeutics, and presents an opportunity to improve drug discovery efforts by integrating mechanical rigidity as a parameter in screening campaigns.","Medina S.H., Bush B., Cam M., Sevcik E., Delrio F.W., Nandy K., Schneider J.P.",10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.02.018,Biomaterials
A Pan-Cancer Analysis Revealed The Role Of The Slc16 Family In Cancer,"Cancer is one of the serious diseases that endanger human health and bring a heavy burden to world economic development. Although the current targeted therapy and immunotherapy have achieved initial results, the emergence of drug resistance shows that the existing research is far from enough. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment has been found to be an important condition for tumor development and has profound research value. The SLC16 family is a group of monocarboxylic acid transporters involved in cancer metabolism and the formation of the tumor microenvironment. However, there have been no generalized cancer studies in the SLC16 family. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of the SLC16 family. The results showed that multiple members of the SLC16 family could be used as prognostic indicators for many tumors, and were associated with immune invasion and tumor stem cells. Therefore, the SLC16 family has extensive exploration value in the future.","Li J., Xie J., Wu D., Chen L., Gong Z., Wu R., Hu Y., Zhao J., Xu Y.",10.1080/19336950.2021.1965422,Channels
"Rjt-101, A Novel Camptothecin Derivative, Is Highly Effective In The Treatment Of Melanoma Through Dna Damage By Targeting Topoisomerase 1","Melanoma is one of the most aggressive malignancies. Drug resistance and toxicity limits the clinical efficacy of melanoma chemotherapeutic drugs such as dacarbazine. Therefore, the development of chemotherapeutic agents for melanoma treatment is urgently needed. RJT-101 significantly inhibits the proliferation of melanoma cells, however has low cytotoxicity to non-malignant cells. RJT-101 induces apoptosis, DNA damage, and G2/M phase arrest, as a consequent, attenuates tumor growth, lung metastasis in vivo as well as prolongs survival of tumor bearing mice. RJT-101 could block topoisomerase I (Top1) activity as well as induce its degradation through proteasome system. Interestingly, Top1 is over-expressed in melanoma cells, compared to non-malignant cells. Knock down of Top1 suppresses melanoma cells growth and induces apoptosis and DNA damage in melanoma cells. RJT-101 effectively inhibits melanoma cells (including vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells) proliferation in vitro and in vivo through the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis by inhibiting of Top1, indicating RJT-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.","Lian C., Cao S., Zeng W., Li Y., Su J., Li J., Zhao S., Wu L., Tao J., Zhou J., Chen X., Peng C.",10.1016/j.bcp.2019.113716,Biochemical Pharmacology
Antibacterial Action Of Synthetic Antilipopolysaccharide Peptides (Salp) Involves Neutralization Of Both Membrane-Bound And Free Toxins,"Increasing failure of conventional antibiotics to combat bacterial infections requires the urgent development of new antibacterial drugs; a promising class of new drugs based on antimicrobial peptides. Here, we studied the molecular interaction of polycationic synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptides (SALPs) with various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains. The analysis of antimicrobial activity by conventional techniques and atomic force microscopy showed a strict dependence on amino acid (aa) sequences, with the type of amino acid, its position within the primary structure, and the sequence length being critical parameters. By monitoring lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or bacteria-induced cytokine production in human mononuclear cells and whole blood, we found a direct link between the binding of the lead compound Pep19-2.5 to Salmonella enterica and the anti-inflammatory activity of the peptide. Thermodynamic analysis of Pep19-2.5 binding to the bacterial cell envelope showed an exothermic reaction with saturation characteristics, whereas small-angle X-ray scattering data indicated a direct attachment of Pep19-2.5 to the bacterial cell envelope. This binding preferentially takes place to the LPS outer monolayer, as evidenced by the change in the LPS acyl chain and phosphate vibrational bands seen by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We report here that the anti-inflammatory activity of Pep19-2.5 is not only connected with neutralization of cell-free bacterial toxins but also with a direct binding of the peptide to the outer leaflet of the bacterial outer membrane.","Correa W., Heinbockel L., Behrends J., Kaconis Y., Barcena-Varela S., Gutsmann T., Mauss K., Schürholz T., Schromm A.B., Martinez De Tejada G., Brandenburg K.",10.1111/febs.14805,Febs Journal
What Do We Learn From Spheroid Culture Systems? Insights From Tumorspheres Derived From Primary Colon Cancer Tissue,"Due to their self-renewal and tumorigenic properties, tumor-initiating cells (TICs) have been hypothesized to be important targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). However the study of TICs is hampered by the fact that the identification and culturing of TICs is still a subject of extensive debate. Floating three-dimensional spheroid cultures (SC) that grow in serumfree medium supplemented with growth factors are supposed to be enriched in TICs. We generated SC from fresh clinical tumor specimens and compared them to SC isolated from CRC cell-lines as well as to adherent differentiated counterparts. Patient-derived SC display self-renewal capacity and can induce serial transplantable tumors in immuno-deficient mice, which phenotypically resemble the tumor of origin. In addition, the original tumor tissue and established SC retain several similar CRC-relevant mutations. Primary SC express key stemness proteins such as SOX2, OCT4, NANOG and LGR5 and importantly show increased chemoresistance ability compared to their adherent differentiated counterparts and to cell line-derived SC. Strikingly, cells derived from spheroid or adherent differentiating culture conditions displayed similar self-renewal capacity and equally formed tumors in immune-deficient mice, suggesting that self-renewal and tumor-initiation capacity of TICs is not restricted to phenotypically immature spheroid cells, which we describe to be highly plastic and able to reacquire stem-cell traits even after long differentiation processes. Finally, we identified two genes among a sphere gene expression signature that predict disease relapse in CRC patients. Here we propose that SC derived from fresh patient tumor tissue present interesting phenotypic features that may have clinical relevance for chemoresistance and disease relapse and therefore represent a valuable tool to test for new CRCtherapies that overcome drug resistance.","Qureshi-Baig K., Ullmann P., Rodriguez F., Frasquilho S., Nazarov P.V., Haan S., Letellier E.",10.1371/journal.pone.0146052,Plos One
Algae: A Robust Living Material Against Cancer,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Its incidence has been increasing in recent years, and it is becoming a major threat to human health. Conventional cancer treatment strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have faced problems such as drug resistance, toxic side effects and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, better development and utilization of biomaterials can improve the specificity and efficacy of tumor therapy. Algae, as a novel living material, possesses good biocompatibility. Although some reviews have elucidated several algae-based biomaterials for cancer treatment, the majority of the literature has focused on a limited number of algae. As a result, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews on the subject of anticancer algae. This review aims to address this gap by conducting a thorough examination of algal species that show potential for anticancer activity. Furthermore, our review will also elucidate the engineering strategies of algae and discuss the challenges and prospects associated with their implementation.","Xin Z., Zhang M., Cui H., Ding X., Zhang T., Wu L., Cui H., Xue Q., Chen C., Gao J.",10.2147/IJN.S423412,International Journal Of Nanomedicine
"Chemo-Sensitivity Of Two-Dimensional Monolayer And Three-Dimensional Spheroid Of Breast Cancer Mcf-7 Cells To Daunorubicin, Docetaxel, And Arsenic Disulfide","Background/Aim: Chemo-sensitivity of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers and three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were investigated. Materials and Methods: MCF-7 cells were cultured in monolayers or spheroids established using a thermo-reversible gelatin polymer, in the presence of daunorubicin, docetaxel, or As(2)S(2). Cell proliferation was examined by a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Results: Daunorubicin, docetaxel, and As(2)S(2) dose-dependently decreased the MCF-7 cell proliferation in both 2D- and 3D-culture systems. The 3D spheroids were less sensitive to these agents than the 2D cultured cells. Verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, partially enhanced the antiproliferative effects of the agents. DL-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine significantly increased (p<0.05), while N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly inhibited the antiproliferative effects of As(2)S(2) (p<0.003). Conclusion: The 3D spheroids showed less sensitivity to the antiprolliferative efficacies of anticancer agents than the 2D cultured cells. P-Glycoprotein is suggested to be partially implicated in drug resistance. Reduction of cellular glutathione level enhanced the As(2)S(2) cytotoxicity.","Uematsu N., Zhao Y., Kiyomi A., Yuan B., Onda K., Tanaka S., Sugiyama K., Sugiura M., Takagi N., Hayakawa A., Hirano T.",10.21873/anticanres.12450,Anticancer Research
A Novel Pyroptosis-Related Signature For Predicting Prognosis And Indicating Immune Microenvironment Features In Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumor with a propensity for drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. A growing number of studies have elucidated the dual role of pyroptosis in the development of cancer, which is a gasdermin-regulated novel inflammatory programmed cell death. However, the interaction between pyroptosis and the overall survival (OS) of osteosarcoma patients is poorly understood. This study aimed to construct a prognostic model based on pyroptosis-related genes to provide new insights into the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. We identified 46 differentially expressed pyroptosis-associated genes between osteosarcoma tissues and normal control tissues. A total of six risk genes affecting the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients were screened to form a pyroptosis-related signature by univariate and LASSO regression analysis and verified using GSE21257 as a validation cohort. Combined with other clinical characteristics, including age, gender, and metastatic status, we found that the pyroptosis-related signature score, which we named “PRS-score,” was an independent prognostic factor for patients with osteosarcoma and that a low PRS-score indicated better OS and a lower risk of metastasis. The result of ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms showed that a lower PRS-score indicated higher immune scores, higher levels of tumor infiltration by immune cells, more active immune function, and lower tumor purity. In summary, we developed and validated a pyroptosis-related signature for predicting the prognosis of osteosarcoma, which may contribute to early diagnosis and immunotherapy of osteosarcoma.","Zhang Y., He R., Lei X., Mao L., Jiang P., Ni C., Yin Z., Zhong X., Chen C., Zheng Q., Li D.",10.3389/fgene.2021.780780,Frontiers In Genetics
Overexpressed Ces2 Has Prognostic Value In Crc And Knockdown Ces2 Reverses L-Ohp-Resistance In Crc Cells By Inhibition Of The Pi3K Signaling Pathway,"CES-2 (carboxylesterase-2) belongs to the carboxylesterase gene family, which plays crucial roles in lipid mobilization and chemosensitivity to irinotecan. However, its role in chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin (L-OHP) remains unclear. Herein, L-OHP-resistant cells (HCT-116L and RKOL) were established by increasing the concentration of L-OHP. The results showed that CES2 expression was upregulated in L-OHP-resistant tissues and cells lines (both P < 0.01). Low expression of CES2 correlated with a better survival, and the results were further confirmed in the R2 platform: a biologist friendly web-based genomics analysis and visualization application. Downregulation of CES2 suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and reversed L-OHP resistance by medicating the PI3K signaling pathway in L-OHP-resistant cells. However, both PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and activator (IGF-1) could not medicate CES2 expression. These findings indicated that CES2 may be utilized as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for L-OHP resistance in CRC treatment.","Zhang Y., Sun L., Sun Y., Chen Y., Wang X., Xu M., Chi P., Xu Z., Lu X.",10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.111856,Experimental Cell Research
Redirecting Tumor Evolution With Nanocompiler Precision For Enhanced Therapeutic Outcomes,"Precisely programming the highly plastic tumor expression profile to render it devoid of drug resistance and metastatic potential presents immense challenges. Here, a transformative nanocompiler designed to reprogram and stabilize the mutable state of tumor cells is introduced. This nanocompiler features a trio of components: 2-deoxy-d-glucose-modified lipid nanoparticles to inhibit glucose uptake, iron oxide nanoparticles to induce oxidative stress, and a deubiquitinase inhibitor to block adaptive protein profile changes in tumor cells. By specifically targeting the hypermetabolic nature of tumors, this approach disrupted their energy production, ultimately fostering a state of vulnerability and impeding their ability to adapt and resist. The results of this study indicate a substantial reduction in tumor growth and metastasis, thus demonstrating the potential of this strategy to manipulate tumor protein expression and fate. This proactive nanocompiler approach promises to steer cancer therapy toward more effective and lasting outcomes.","Sun W., Cai B., Zhao Z., Li S., He Y., Xie S.",10.1002/adhm.202400366,Advanced Healthcare Materials
Mcm4 Potentiates Evasion Of Hepatocellular Carcinoma From Sorafenib-Induced Ferroptosis Through Nrf2 Signaling Pathway,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. It poses an enormous socioeconomic burden and is a serious public health threat globally due to its poor prognosis. Ferroptosis is a newly identified non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation, iron accumulation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, tumor cells have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade ferroptosis, conferring resistance to drugs. Sorafenib, a first-line therapy for advanced HCC, triggers ferroptosis by selectively targeting solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) to deplete glutathione and inhibit glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), thereby effectively eliminating tumor cells. However, sorafenib resistance has been widely reported, and the precise mechanisms underlying sorafenib drug resistance remain unclear. The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein family contains 10 members with vital roles in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. MCM4, a member of the MCM protein family, might be a potential biomarker in pan-cancer analysis. The present study found that MCM4 was upregulated in liver cancer using bioinformatics analysis and sorafenib-treated HCC cells. Moreover, MCM4 might be regarded as a prognostic biomarker for HCC. Further experiments revealed that MCM4-inhibition enhanced the efficacy of sorafenib through elevation of ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCM4 potentiates sorafenib-induced ferroptosis evasion in HCC by promoting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation. However, no direct interactions were found between Nrf2 and MCM4. Overall, these findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC by targeting MCM4 inhibition.","Liu X., Zhang F., Fan Y., Qiu C., Wang K.",10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113107,International Immunopharmacology
The Pleiotropic Roles Of Adipocyte Secretome In Remodeling Breast Cancer,"Background: Breast cancer is the leading female cancer type and the cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Adipocytes possess important functions of energy supply, metabolic regulation, and cytokine release, and are also the matrix cell that supports mammary gland tissue. In breast cancer tumor microenvironment (TME), adipocytes are the prominent stromal cells and are implicated in inflammation, metastatic formation, metabolic remodeling, and cancer susceptibility. Main body: It is well-established that adipocyte secretome is a reservoir engaged in the regulation of tumor cell behavior by secreting a large number of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and chemokines), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, autotaxin, and resistin), lipid metabolites (free fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate), and other exosome-encapsulated substances. These released factors influence the evolution and clinical outcome of breast cancer through complex mechanisms. The progression of breast cancer tumors revolves around the tumor-adipose stromal network, which may contribute to breast cancer aggressiveness by increasing the pro-malignant potential of TME and tumor cells themselves. Most importantly, the secretome alterations of adipocytes are regarded as distinctly important targets for breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and drug resistance. Conclusion: Therefore, this review will provide a comprehensive description of the specific adipocyte secretome characteristics and interactions within TME cell populations, which will enable us to better tailor strategies for tumor stratification management and treatment.","Zhou X., Zhang J., Lv W., Zhao C., Xia Y., Wu Y., Zhang Q.",10.1186/s13046-022-02408-z,Journal Of Experimental And Clinical Cancer Research
Mir-148A And Mir-152 Reduce Tamoxifen Resistance In Er+ Breast Cancer Via Downregulating Alcam,"Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), also called CD166 is a 105-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobin superfamily. In this study, we studied the association between ALCAM expression and tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer and further investigated how ALCAM is regulated in the cancer cells. IHC staining data showed that the tumor tissues from non-responders (N = 20) generally had significantly stronger ALCAM staining than that from tamoxifen responders (N = 16). In vitro cell assay also confirmed ALCAM upregulation in tamoxifen resistant (TamR) MCF-7 cells than in tamoxifen sensitive (TamS) MCF-7 cells. ALCAM overexpression significantly alleviated 4-Hydroxytestosterone (4-OHT) induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamS MCF-7 cells, while ALCAM knockdown remarkably enhanced 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. Demethylation reagent treatment significantly restored miR-148a and miR-152 expression in TamR MCF-7 cells. MiR-148a and miR-152 can directly target ALCAM 3′UTR and decrease ALCAM expression. MiR-148a overexpression had similar effect as ALCAM siRNA on enhancing 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. MiR-152 overexpression alone caused growth inhibition and increased cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. It also enhanced the effect of 4-OHT. Simultaneous inhibition of miR-148a and miR-152 significantly protected TamS MCF-7 cells from 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis. Based on these findings, we infer that MiR-148a and miR-152 can sensitize TamR MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen at least via downregulating ALCAM.","Chen M.-J., Cheng Y.-M., Chen C.-C., Chen Y.-C., Shen C.-J.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.01.012,Biochemical And Biophysical Research Communications
Identification Of Novel Therapeutic Target Genes In Acquired Lapatinib-Resistant Breast Cancer By Integrative Meta-Analysis,"Acquired resistance to lapatinib is a highly problematic clinical barrier that has to be overcome for a successful cancer treatment. Despite efforts to determine the mechanisms underlying acquired lapatinib resistance (ALR), no definitive genetic factors have been reported to be solely responsible for the acquired resistance in breast cancer. Therefore, we performed a cross-platform meta-analysis of three publically available microarray datasets related to breast cancer with ALR, using the R-based RankProd package. From the meta-analysis, we were able to identify a total of 990 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 406 upregulated, 584 downregulated) that are potentially associated with ALR. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that “response to organic substance” and “p53 signaling pathway” may be largely involved in ALR process. Of these, many of the top 50 upregulated and downregulated DEGs were found in oncogenesis of various tumors and cancers. For the top 50 DEGs, we constructed the gene coexpression and protein–protein interaction networks from a huge database of well-known molecular interactions. By integrative analysis of two systemic networks, we condensed the total number of DEGs to six common genes (LGALS1, PRSS23, PTRF, FHL2, TOB1, and SOCS2). Furthermore, these genes were confirmed in functional module eigens obtained from the weighted gene correlation network analysis of total DEGs in the microarray datasets (“GSE16179” and “GSE52707”). Our integrative meta-analysis could provide a comprehensive perspective into complex mechanisms underlying ALR in breast cancer and a theoretical support for further chemotherapeutic studies.","Lee Y.S., Hwang S.G., Kim J.K., Park T.H., Kim Y.R., Myeong H.S., Choi J.D., Kwon K., Jang C.S., Ro Y.T., Noh Y.H., Kim S.Y.",10.1007/s13277-015-4033-7,Tumor Biology
The Roles Of Cancer Stem Cells And Therapeutic Implications In Melanoma,"Melanoma is a highly malignant skin tumor characterized by high metastasis and poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of melanoma stem cells (MSCs)—a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs)—in driving tumor growth, metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence. Similar to CSCs in other cancers, MSCs possess unique characteristics, including specific surface markers, dysregulated signaling pathways, and the ability to thrive within complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explored the current landscape of MSC research, discussing the identification of MSC-specific surface markers, the role of key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog (Hh), and how interactions within the TME, including hypoxia and immune cells, contribute to MSC-mediated drug resistance and metastatic behavior. Furthermore, we also investigated the latest therapeutic strategies targeting MSCs, such as small-molecule inhibitors, immune-based approaches, and novel vaccine developments, with an emphasis on their potential to overcome melanoma progression and improve clinical outcomes. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the complex roles of MSCs in melanoma biology and offers perspectives for future research and therapeutic advances against this challenging disease.","Mu X., Zhou Y., Yu Y., Zhang M., Liu J.",10.3389/fimmu.2024.1486680,Frontiers In Immunology
"A Conformational Change Of Complement C5 Is Required For Thrombin-Mediated Cleavage, Revealed By A Novel Ex Vivo Human Whole Blood Model Preserving Full Thrombin Activity","Thrombin activation of C5 connects thrombosis to inflammation. Complement research in whole blood ex vivo necessitates anticoagulation, which potentially interferes with the inflammatory modulation by thrombin. We challenged the concept of thrombin as an activator of native C5 by analyzing complement activation and C5 cleavage in human whole blood anticoagulated with Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP), a peptide targeting fibrin polymerization downstream of thrombin, allowing complete endogenous thrombin generation. GPRP dose-dependently inhibited coagulation but allowed for platelet activation in accordance with thrombin generation. Spontaneous and bacterial-induced complement activation by Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, analyzed at the level of C3 and C5, were similar in blood anticoagulated with GPRP and the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. In the GPRP model, endogenous thrombin, even at supra-physiologic concentrations, did not cleave native C5, despite efficiently cleaving commercially sourced purified C5 protein, both in buffer and when added to C5-deficient serum. In normal serum, only exogenously added, commercially sourced C5 was cleaved, whereas the native plasma C5 remained intact. Crucially, affinity-purified C5, eluted under mild conditions using an MgCl(2) solution, was not cleaved by thrombin. Acidification of plasma to pH # 6.8 by hydrochloric or lactic acid induced a C5 antigenic change, nonreversible by pH neutralization, that permitted cleavage by thrombin. Circular dichroism on purified C5 confirmed the structural change during acidification. Thus, we propose that pH-induced conformational change allows thrombin-mediated cleavage of C5 and that, contrary to previous reports, thrombin does not cleave plasma C5 in its native form, suggesting that thrombin cleavage of C5 may be restricted to certain pathophysiological conditions.","Nilsson P.H., Johnson C., Quach Q.H., Macpherson A., Durrant O., Pischke S.E., Fure H., Landsem A., Bergseth G., Schjalm C., Haugaard-Kedström L.M., Huber-Lang M., Van Den Elsen J., Brekke O.-L., Mollnes T.E.",10.4049/jimmunol.2001471,Journal Of Immunology
Ifih1 Promotes Apoptosis Through The Tbk1/Irf3 Pathway In Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast malignancy. Although some patients benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, current treatment methods rely mainly on chemotherapy. It is imperative to develop predictors of efficacy and identify individuals who will be sensitive to particular treatment regimens. This study analyzed peripheral interferons and immune cell subsets in TNBC patients receiving pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy. The effects of interferon-induced helicase 1 (IFIH1) on the biological characteristics of apoptosis and PD-L1 expression of cancer cells and its potential mechanism were investigated using bioinformatics analysis, clinical specimens, and in vitro study. We found that serum interferon-γ and interferon-α2 levels were significantly higher in TNBC patients with pathologic complete response (pCR). The expression of IFIH1 is markedly upregulated in various tumors, including breast cancer. Immunohistochemical results revealed that IFIH1 was specifically located in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that genes co-expressed with IFIH1 were involved in tumor immune-related pathways and apoptosis. Knockdown of IFIH1 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells resulted in significantly increased cell proliferation and colony formation. Regarding apoptosis-related pathway proteins, there was a significant decrease in levels of phosphorylated TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In addition, the expression of PD-L1 was significantly downregulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated the existence of binding sites between IRF3 and PD-L1 promotors. Our data indicate that cancer cell IFIH1 promotes apoptosis and PD-L1 expression, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker of efficacy and therapeutic target in TNBC.","Shi C., Wang X., Li J., Wu S., Liu Z., Ren X., Zhang X., Liu Y.",10.4149/neo_2024_240614N255,Neoplasma
Elevated Co(2) Aggravated Polystyrene Microplastics Effects On The Rice-Soil System Under Field Conditions,"Polystyrene microplastics (PS) are decomposed very slowly due to their recalcitrance and inevitably interact with the changing climate. How the interaction between PS and increasing CO(2) concentration affects the plant-soil system is rarely investigated. Here, a free-air CO(2) enrichment system in farm fields was used to study the impacts of PS added to soil at 10 mg kg(−1) on rice and soil bacterial communities at different CO(2) levels (ambient∼390 ppm and elevated∼590 ppm). Results showed that single PS interfered with Fe, Mn and Zn uptake of rice, and it increased the abundances of bacteria taxa assigned to N turnover and urease activities, leading to altered soil N transformation and availability. Elevated CO(2) alone enhanced rice photosynthesis, decreased the abundances of nitrogen-fixation bacteria, and induced co-occurrence patterns between bacteria simpliﬁed and decentralized. Combined PS and elevated CO(2) significantly decreased rice stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by 56.70% and 29.46%, respectively, and further inhibited elements uptake. Besides, combined exposure significantly disturbed bacterial amino acid metabolism, and stimulated the adaptative responses of resistant bacteria. Overall, this study revealed that increasing CO(2) concentrations may exacerbate the impacts of PS on rice performance and soil bacterial communities, providing new insights into the interaction between microplastics and climate change.","Xu M., Xu Q., Wang G., Du W., Zhu J., Yin Y., Ji R., Wang X., Guo H.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120603,Environmental Pollution
Deciphering The Inhibition Mechanisms Of Microplastics On The Full-Stage Sludge Anaerobic Digestion Via Enrichment To Anaerobic Microbes And Toxicity Of Released Compounds,"Increasingly accumulated microplastics (MPs) in sludge could affect the sludge treatment process, while the contributions and mechanisms of MP particles and the released organic matters (MP-DOM) are not fully understood. To fill this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects and mechanisms of MPs on sludge anaerobic digestion. In the presence of MPs, the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organic matters and methanogenesis all decreased due to the inhibition on the activity of anaerobic microorganisms and key enzymes. Mechanism analysis showed that MPs mainly acted as substrates to enrich anaerobic microorganisms and reduced the abundance and function of free microorganisms in sludge that metabolized organic matters. Moreover, a large amount of organic compounds including various plasticizers (dibutyl phthalate) and chain-scission products (benzoic acid) from physical abrasions of MPs with sludge particles, which made a 50.9–51.6 % contribution to the MP-inhibited sludge anaerobic digestion by the chemical toxicity and generated reactive oxygen species. Owing to the decreased digestion performance, the risk associated with ARGs and pathogenic bacteria increased distinctly. The findings highlight the concerns about MP-derived organic compounds compared to the substrate themselves and suggest the necessity for removing MPs in the sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).","Zhang Z., Liu P., Zhang T., Li K., Wu X., Qiang H., Jia H., Zhu L.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136856,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Inhibition Of Stearoyl-Coa Desaturase 1 Reverts Braf And Mek Inhibition-Induced Selection Of Cancer Stem Cells In Braf-Mutated Melanoma,"Background: Combination therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors significantly improves survival in BRAF mutated melanoma patients but is unable to prevent disease recurrence due to the emergence of drug resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been involved in these long-term treatment failures. We previously reported in lung cancer that CSCs maintenance is due to altered lipid metabolism and dependent upon Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD1)-mediated upregulation of YAP and TAZ. On this ground, we investigated the role of SCD1 in melanoma CSCs. Methods: SCD1 gene expression data of melanoma patients were downloaded from TCGA and correlated with disease progression by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed on patient's tissues by qRT-PCR and IHC analyses. The effects of combination of BRAF/MEKi and the SCD1 inhibitor MF-438 were monitored by spheroid-forming and proliferation assays on a panel of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines grown in 3D and 2D conditions, respectively. SCD1, YAP/TAZ and stemness markers were evaluated in melanoma cells and tissues by qRT-PCR, WB and Immunofluorescence. Results: We first observed that SCD1 expression increases during melanoma progression. BRAF-mutated melanoma 3D cultures enriched for CSCs overexpressed SCD1 and were more resistant than 2D differentiated cultures to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. We next showed that exposure of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to MAPK pathway inhibitors enhanced stemness features by upregulating the expression of YAP/TAZ and downstream genes but surprisingly not SCD1. However, SCD1 pharmacological inhibition was able to downregulate YAP/TAZ and to revert at the same time CSC enrichment and resistance to MAPK inhibitors. Conclusions: Our data underscore the role of SCD1 as prognostic marker in melanoma and promote the use of SCD1 inhibitors in combination with MAPK inhibitors for the control of drug resistance.","Pisanu M.E., Maugeri-Saccà M., Fattore L., Bruschini S., De Vitis C., Tabbì E., Bellei B., Migliano E., Kovacs D., Camera E., Picardo M., Jakopin Z., Cippitelli C., Bartolazzi A., Raffa S., Torrisi M.R., Fulciniti F., Ascierto P.A., Ciliberto G., Mancini R.",10.1186/s13046-018-0989-7,Journal Of Experimental And Clinical Cancer Research
New Directions On Membranes For Removal And Degradation Of Emerging Pollutants In Aqueous Systems,"Emerging pollutants (EPs) refer to a group of non-regulated chemical or biological substances that have been recently introduced or detected in the environment. These pollutants tend to exhibit resistance to conventional treatment methods and can persist in the environment for prolonged periods, posing potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. As we enter a new era of managing these pollutants, membrane-based technologies hold significant promise in mitigating impact of EPs on the environment and safeguarding human health due to their high selectivity, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and capability for simultaneous separation and degradation. Moreover, these technologies continue to evolve rapidly with the development of new membrane materials and functionalities, advanced treatment strategies, and analyses for effectively treating EPs of more recent concerns. The objective of this review is to present the latest directions and advancements in membrane-based technologies for addressing EPs. By highlighting the progress in this field, we aim to share valuable perspectives with researchers and contribute to the development of future directions in sustainable treatments for EPs.","Zhao D.L., Zhou W., Shen L., Li B., Sun H., Zeng Q., Tang C.Y., Lin H., Chung T.-S.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121111,Water Research
Microbiology Of Acute Bacterial Skin And Skin-Structure Infections In Greece: A Proposed Clinical Prediction Score For The Causative Pathogen,"Although clinical definitions of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) are now well established, guidance of the prediction of likely pathogens based on evidence is missing. This was a large survey of the microbiology of ABSSSIs in Greece. During the period November 2014 to December 2016, all admissions for ABSSSI in 16 departments of internal medicine or surgery in Greece were screened to determine the likely bacterial aetiology. Samples were cultured on conventional media. Expression of the SA442, mecA/mecC and SCCmec-orfX junction genes was assessed. Following univariate and forward logistic regression analysis, clinical characteristics were used to develop scores to predict the likely pathogen with a target of 90% specificity. In total, 1027 patients were screened and 633 had positive microbiology. Monomicrobial infection by Gram-positive cocci occurred in 52.1% and by Gram-negative bacteria in 20.5%, and mixed infection by Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacteria in 27.3%. The most common isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Resistance to methicillin was 57.3% (53.5–61.1%). Three predictive scores were developed: one for infection by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, incorporating recent hospitalisation, atrial fibrillation, residency in long-term care facility (LTCF) and stroke; one for mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections, incorporating localisation of ABSSSI in lumbar area, fluoroquinolone intake in last 6 days, residency in LTCF and stroke; and another for Gram-negative infection, incorporating skin ulcer presentation, peptic ulcer and solid tumour malignancy. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant staphylococci are the main pathogens of ABSSSIs. The scores developed may help to predict the likely pathogen.","Nodaras C., Kotsaki A., Tziolos N., Kontopoulou T., Akinosoglou K., Chrisanthakopoulou M., Kranidioti E., Kritselis I., Voloudakis N., Vittoros V., Gogkou A., Fillas I., Toutouzas K.G., Bristianou M., Tsoutsos D., Christaki E., Adamis G., Kaziani K., Tsironis C., Lada M., Kokkinakis E., Sympardi S., Koutelidakis I.M., Karkamanis A., Pantazi A., Bayram C., Alexiou Z., Mousoulis G., Gogos C., O'Hare M., Griffiths D., Macgowan A., Sambatakou H., Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J.",10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.08.020,International Journal Of Antimicrobial Agents
Comparative Analysis Of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Isolated From Outpatients Of Dermatology Unit In Hospitals And Clinics,"Community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) is a causative agent of intractable skin infections. In general, clinical symptoms of hospital outpatients with skin infections are severer than those of clinic patients. Hence, molecular epidemiological features of the CO-MRSA strains from hospital outpatients are predicted to be different from those of clinic patients. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis for CO-MRSA isolates from outpatients with impetigo in hospitals and clinics located in the same district of Tokyo, Japan. Incidence of MRSA infection was higher in hospital outpatients (21.5%, 20/93 isolates) than in clinic patients (14.5%, 121/845 isolates). The resistance rate to clindamycin, which is a common topical antimicrobial agent in dermatology, in the isolates from hospital outpatients (60.0%) was higher than those from clinic patients (31.4%). Proportion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type II, which is a representative type of hospital-acquired MRSA in Japan, in the isolates from hospital outpatients (65.0%) was significantly higher than those from clinic patients (30.6%) (P < 0.01). Multilocus sequence typing showed that the clonal complex 89-SCCmec type II (CC89-II) clone, which exhibits clindamycin resistance, was the most predominant (55.0%) in the isolates from hospital outpatients. On the other hand, all CC8-IV, CC121-V, and CC89-V clones accounted for 60% in clinic patients were susceptible to clindamycin. Our findings suggested that the clindamycin-resistant CC89-II CO-MRSA clone might be more related to skin infections in hospital outpatients than clinic patients.","Nakaminami H., Sugiyama T., Okamura Y., Hanawa M., Abou M., Sawada K., Chiba Y., Kobayashi Y., Kawasaki S., Ueki T., Funatsu S., Nagatani T., Noguchi N.",10.1016/j.jiac.2018.09.002,Journal Of Infection And Chemotherapy
Exosomal Mir-19A Derived From Melanoma Cell Promotes The Vemurafenib Resistance Of Malignant Melanoma Through Directly Targeting Lrig1 To Reactivate Akt And Mapk Pathway,"Exosomes derived from neighboring v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 inhibitor (BRAFi)-resistant melanoma cells mediate the formation of resistance in melanoma cells sensitive to BRAFi. The function and molecular mechanisms of exosomal miRNA in BRAFi resistance of melanoma have not been studied. We found that the expression of miR-19a in BRAFi resistant melanoma cells was significantly higher than that in sensitive cells, and miR-19a contributes to the resistance of melanoma cells to BRAFi by targeting immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1). miR-19a was highly enriched in exosomes secreted from BRAFi resistant melanoma cells, and these exosomal miR-19a promote the spread of BRAFi resistant. The reactivation of Protein kinase B (AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways is the main reason for the BRAFi resistant of melanoma cells. We demonstrated that exosomal miR-19a derived from melanoma cell promotes the formation and spread of BRAFi resistant in melanoma through targeting LRIG1 to reactivate AKT and MAPK pathway. Therefore, miR-19a may serve as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma patients with acquired drug resistance.","Luan W., Lu X., Peng H., Shen X., Rao M., Ruan H.",10.1016/j.prp.2024.155410,Pathology Research And Practice
Osmundacetone Inhibits Angiogenesis Of Infantile Hemangiomas Through Inducing Caspases And Reducing Vegfr2/Mmp9,"Aim: This study aims to explore the potential of Osmundacetone (OSC) as a new treatment for infantile hemangiomas (IH), the most common benign tumors in infancy. Currently, propranolol serves as the primary treatment for IH, but its effectiveness is limited, and it poses challenges of drug resistance and side effects. There-fore, there is a pressing need to identify alternative therapies for IH. Methods: The effects of OSC on the proliferation and apoptosis of HemECs (endothelial cells from hemangio-mas) were assessed using CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, HOCHEST 33342 staining, and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate OSC's influence on Caspases and angiogenesis-related pro-teins. Animal models were established using HemECs and BALB/c mice, and histological and immunohisto-chemical staining were conducted to evaluate the impact of OSC on mouse hemangiomas, VEGFR2, and MMP9 expression. Results: OSC treatment significantly reduced HemECs' viability and colony-forming ability, while promoting apoptosis, as indicated by increased HOCHEST 33342 staining. OSC upregulated the protein expression of Bax, PARP, Caspase9, Caspase3, AIF, Cyto C, FADD, and Caspase8 in HemECs. In animal models, OSC treatment effectively reduced hemangioma size and improved histopathological changes. OSC also suppressed VEGFR2 and MMP9 expression while elevating Caspase3 levels in mouse hemangiomas. Conclusion: OSC demonstrated promising results in inhibiting HemECs' proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and ameliorating pathological changes in hemangiomas in mice. Moreover, it influenced the expression of crucial caspases and angiogenesis-related proteins. These findings suggest that OSC holds potential as a novel drug for clinical treatment of IH.","Ke C., Chen C., Yang M., Chen H., Li L., Ke Y.",10.2174/0118715206273410231103100600,Anti-Cancer Agents In Medicinal Chemistry
A Bioreactor System For The Manufacture Of A Genetically Modified Plasmodium Falciparum Blood Stage Malaria Cell Bank For Use In A Clinical Trial,"Background: Although the use of induced blood stage malaria infection has proven to be a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against Plasmodium falciparum, a limiting factor has been the availability of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) - compliant defined P. falciparum strains for in vivo use. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effective method for the large-scale production of P. falciparum cell banks suitable for use in clinical trials. Methods: Genetically-attenuated parasites (GAP) were produced by targeted deletion of the gene encoding the knob associated histidine rich protein (kahrp) from P. falciparum strain 3D7. A GAP master cell bank (MCB) was manufactured by culturing parasites in an FDA approved single use, closed system sterile plastic bioreactor. All components used to manufacture the MCB were screened to comply with standards appropriate for in vivo use. The cryopreserved MCB was subjected to extensive testing to ensure GMP compliance for a phase 1 investigational product. Results: Two hundred vials of the GAP MCB were successfully manufactured. At harvest, the GAP MCB had a parasitaemia of 6.3%, with 96% of parasites at ring stage. Testing confirmed that all release criteria were met (sterility, absence of viral contaminants and endotoxins, parasite viability following cryopreservation, identity and anti-malarial drug sensitivity of parasites). Conclusion: Large-scale in vitro culture of P. falciparum parasites using a wave bioreactor can be achieved under GMP-compliant conditions. This provides a cost-effective methodology for the production of malaria parasites suitable for administration in clinical trials.","Pawliw R., Farrow R., Sekuloski S., Jennings H., Healer J., Phuong T., Sathe P., Pasay C., Evans K., Cowman A.F., Schofield L., Chen N., Mccarthy J., Trenholme K.",10.1186/s12936-018-2435-x,Malaria Journal
Construction And Validation Of A Novel Pyroptosis-Related Gene Signature To Predict The Prognosis Of Uveal Melanoma,"Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor with a poor prognosis. Currently, treatment for UVM is limited, and the development of drug resistance and tumor recurrence are common. Therefore, it is important to identify new prognostic biomarkers of UVM and explore their role in the tumor microenvironment. Pyroptosis is a way of cell programmed death, and related research is in full throttle. However, the role of pyroptosis in UVM is unclear. In this study, we constructed the prognosis model of pyroptosis-related genes of UVM. This model can accurately guide the prognosis of UVM, and different groups differ in immune infiltration. We further verified our results in cell experiments. To some extent, our study can provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of UVM.","Cao Y., Xie J., Chen L., Hu Y., Zhai L., Yuan J., Suo L., Shen Y., Ye R., Li J., Gong Z., Dong Y., Bao W., Li H., Wang M.",10.3389/fcell.2021.761350,Frontiers In Cell And Developmental Biology
Rhoc: A Fascinating Journey From A Cytoskeletal Organizer To A Cancer Stem Cell Therapeutic Target,"Tumor heterogeneity results in differential response to therapy due to the existence of plastic tumor cells, called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which exhibit the property of resistance to therapy, invasion and metastasis. These cells have a distinct, signaling network active at every stage of progression. It is difficult to envisage that the CSCs will have a unique set of signaling pathways regulating every stage of disease progression. Rather, it would be easier to believe that a single pivotal pathway having significant contribution at every stage, which can further turn on a battery of signaling mechanisms specific to that stage, would be instrumental in regulating the signaling network, enabling easy transition from one state to another. In this context, we discuss the role of RhoC which has contributed to several phenotypes during tumor progression.RhoC (Ras homolog gene family member C) has been widely reported to regulate actin organization. It has been shown to impact the motility of cancer cells, resultantly affecting invasion and metastasis, and has contributed to carcinoma progression of the breast, pancreas, lung, ovaries and cervix, among several others. The most interesting finding has been its indispensable role in metastasis. Also, it has the ability to modulate various other phenotypes like angiogenesis, motility, invasion, metastasis, and anoikis resistance. These observations suggest that RhoC imparts the plasticity required by tumor cells to exhibit such diverse functions based on microenvironmental cues. This was further confirmed by recent reports which show that it regulates cancer stem cells in breast, ovary and head and neck cancers. Studies also suggest that the inhibition of RhoC results in abolition of advanced tumor phenotypes.Our review throws light on how RhoC, which is capable of modulating various phenotypes may be the apt core signaling candidate regulating disease progression. Additionally, mice studies show that RhoC is not essential for embryogenesis, giving scope for its development as a possible therapeutic target. This review thus stresses on the need to understand the protein and its functioning in greater detail to enable its development as a stem cell marker and a possible therapeutic target.","Thomas P., Pranatharthi A., Ross C., Srivastava S.",10.1186/s13046-019-1327-4,Journal Of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research : Cr
Btk Suppresses Myeloma Cellular Senescence Through Activating Akt/P27/Rb Signaling,"We previously explored the role of BTK in maintaining multiple myeloma stem cells (MMSCs) self-renewal and drug-resistance. Here we investigated the elevation of BTK suppressing MM cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cellular growth arrest. We firstly discovered that an increased expression of BTK in MM samples compared to normal controls by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and significant chromosomal gain in primary samples. In addition, BTK high-expressing MM patients are associated with poor outcome in both Total Therapy 2 (TT2) and TT3 cohorts. Knockdown BTK expression by shRNA induced MM cellular senescence using β-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) staining, cell growth arrest by cell cycle staining and decreased clonogenicity while forcing BTK expression in MM cells abrogated these characteristics. We also validated this feature in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs), which showed that elevated BTK expression was resistant to MEF senescence after serial cultivation in vitro. Further mechanism study revealed that BTK activated AKT signaling leading to downregulation of P27 expression and hindered RB activity while AKT inhibitor, LY294002, overcame BTK-overexpression induced cellular senescence resistance. Eventually we demonstrated that BTK inhibitor, CGI-1746, induced MM cellular senescence, colony reduction and tumorigenecity inhibition in vivo. Summarily, we designate a novel mechanism of BTK in mediating MM growth, and BTK inhibitor is of great potential in vivo and in vitro suggesting BTK is a promising therapeutic target for MM.","Gu C., Peng H., Lu Y., Yang H., Tian Z., Yin G., Zhang W., Lu S., Zhang Y., Yang Y.",10.18632/oncotarget.18096,Oncotarget
Development And Optimization Of In-Situ Gels For Vaginal Delivery Of Metronidazole And Curcumin Via Box-Behnken Design: In Vitro Characterization And Anti-Trichomonas Activity,"The aim of this study was to develop and optimize vaginal poloxamer in-situ gel formulations with metronidazole and curcumin combination for the treatment of infections caused by parasitic protozoa, Trichomonas vaginalis. Protozoan parasite infections cost the globe a colossal burden in terms of human and animal health. Lack of medication in low-income countries and rising drug resistance are posing substantial challenges in control and eradication of this infection. Today there is a tremendous drift in new alternative/synergic treatment strategies. Combination treatment, in particular, appear to be a promising approach against persistent, common, and infectious diseases like T. vaginalis. Poloxamer in-situ gels were prepared and optimized using the Box-Behnken statistical experiment design concept. The effect of critical parameters on critical quality features were evaluated by measuring the T(sol-gel) transition temperature, solubilizing capacity of active substances in poloxamer bases, plastic viscosity, dynamic viscosity, and yield values. Optimized formulations (OPT-F1; F2; F3) were also tested for flow and mechanical properties, in-vitro release properties, cytotoxicity against the SK-HEP-1 cell line, and antiparasitic activity. The optimum formulations include properties that make them appropriate for vaginal administration and have been shown to be non-cytotoxic. The candidate gel formulation (OPT-F3) demonstrated statistically significant in-vitro activity against T. Vaginalis viability, demonstrating its antiparasitic effect. Stability studies conducted at 4 °C and 25 °C temperatures revealed that the ideal formulations retained their stability for 90 days. The study found that the gel containing metronidazole and curcumin is an effective and innovative approach to treating trichomoniasis and advances scientific research in this field.","Pozharani L.B., Baloglu E., Suer K., Guler E., Burgaz E.V., Kunter I.",10.1016/j.jddst.2023.104739,Journal Of Drug Delivery Science And Technology
A Monoclonal Antibody Against Β1 Integrin Inhibits Proliferation And Increases Survival In An Orthotopic Model Of High-Grade Meningioma,"Background: High-grade meningiomas (HGMs; World Health Organization [WHO] classification grade II and III) have high relapse rates and poor clinical outcomes despite surgery and radiation treatments. No effective medical therapy currently exists for HGMs, and developing novel therapeutic strategies depends on the identification of molecular drivers. In cancer, β1 integrin enhances malignant characteristics, including proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Objective: We conducted this study to investigate whether β1 integrin could be a therapeutic target in HGMs. Patients and Methods: Expression of β1 integrin was examined in gene array datasets, with proteomics of clinical meningioma specimens, and in patient-derived HGM xenografts. Anti-tumor activity of OS2966, a first-in-class humanized antagonizing monoclonal antibody against β1 integrin, was tested in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of patient-derived malignant meningioma. Results: β1 integrin was expressed in meningiomas of all WHO grades and two xenografts tested. In vitro, OS2966 suppressed the viability of NF2-deficient MN3 sphere cells and NF2-wild-type IOMM-Lee malignant meningioma cells only when plated on laminin-coated plastic. While OS2966 decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both MN3 cells and laminin-grown IOMM-Lee cells, OS2966 only affected the phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397) in MN3, and of Akt (Ser473) in IOMM-Lee cells, respectively, indicating differential pathway inhibition. Systemic administration of OS2966 in mice bearing orthotopic MN3 HGMs inhibited HGM cell proliferation and significantly extended overall survival of the treated mice. Conclusions: β1 Integrin may be a therapeutic target in HGMs, and further preclinical and clinical development of OS2966 for HGM therapy is warranted.","Nigim F., Kiyokawa J., Gurtner A., Kawamura Y., Hua L., Kasper E.M., Brastianos P.K., Cahill D.P., Rabkin S.D., Martuza R.L., Carbonell W.S., Wakimoto H.",10.1007/s11523-019-00654-4,Targeted Oncology
Methicillin Resistance In Staphylococcus Aureus Modulates The Transcriptome And Disease Pathology In A Murine Model Of Endophthalmitis,"The ever-increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endophthalmitis is of particular concern as they are associated with poor outcomes. To compare the histology and whole transcriptome of Methicillin resistant (MRSA) and Methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis in an experimental murine model. MRSA and MSSA endophthalmitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice and disease progression was scored clinically and histologically at 24 h p.i. Retinal changes were monitored by H&E, CD45, MPO and GFAP staining followed by retinal cell death evaluation. Whole Transcriptome was analysed using the SuperPrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression v2 chip. Differential gene expression analysis (Limma package, R) was done followed by enrichment of pathways (KEGG database). Increased corneal haze, diminished vitreous clarity and red reflex was observed in MRSA infected mice eye compared to MSSA (p = 0.04). Histological assessment also corroborated with increased disease severity in MRSA (p = 0.02). Although MRSA infected eye displayed higher CD45(+) cells and greater GFAP intensity, the difference was not statistically significant. However, higher retinal cell death was found to be associated with the MRSA infection (p = 0.007). Our study also revealed that MRSA infection induces changes in host transcriptome (FC = 1.5, p = 0.05), revealing the involvement of several interleukins (IL-11,15,10,1ra), chemokines (CCL-11, CXCL-1), Interferon receptors, GM-CSF, M-CSF, MMPs, Neruopilin2 (NRP-2), Ubiquitin associated peptidase and apoptotic ligands. ErbB signalling, JAK-STAT, adipocytokine and Ras signalling were the top divergently enriched pathways. Our study confirms the differential host immune response triggered by MRSA infection in the eye. Our study may help to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis and to identify additional candidate drug targets for the treatment of MRSA endophthalmitis.","Naik P., Naik M.N., Mishra D.K., Joseph J.",10.1016/j.exer.2022.109016,Experimental Eye Research
Antiparasitic Mebendazole (Mbz) Effectively Overcomes Cisplatin Resistance In Human Ovarian Cancer Cells By Inhibiting Multiple Cancer-Associated Signaling Pathways,"Ovarian cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in women. Its routine clinical management includes surgical resection and systemic therapy with chemotherapeutics. While the first-line systemic therapy requires the combined use of platinum-based agents and paclitaxel, many ovarian cancer patients have recurrence and eventually succumb to chemoresistance. Thus, it is imperative to develop new strategies to overcome recurrence and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. Repurposing previously-approved drugs is a cost-effective strategy for cancer drug discovery. The antiparasitic drug mebendazole (MBZ) is one of the most promising drugs with repurposing potential. Here, we investigate whether MBZ can overcome cisplatin resistance and sensitize chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. We first established and characterized two stable and robust cisplatin-resistant (CR) human ovarian cancer lines and demonstrated that MBZ markedly inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed cell wounding healing/migration, and induced apoptosis in both parental and CR cells at low micromole range. Mechanistically, MBZ was revealed to inhibit multiple cancer-related signal pathways including ELK/SRF, NFKB, MYC/MAX, and E2F/DP1 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We further showed that MBZ synergized with cisplatin to suppress cell proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and blunt tumor growth in xenograft tumor model of human cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that MBZ may be repurposed as a synergistic sensitizer of cisplatin in treating chemoresistant human ovarian cancer, which warrants further clinical studies.","Huang L., Zhao L., Zhang J., He F., Wang H., Liu Q., Shi D., Ni N., Wagstaff W., Chen C., Reid R.R., Haydon R.C., Luu H.H., Shen L., He T.-C., Tang L.",10.18632/aging.203232,Aging
An Advanced Comprehensive Muti-Cell-Type-Specific Model For Predicting Anti-Pd-1 Therapeutic Effect In Melanoma,"Rationale: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-L1 pathway have promise in patients with advanced melanoma. However, drug resistance usually results in limited patient benefits. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies have elucidated that MM patients display distinctive transcriptional features of tumor cells, immune cells and interstitial cells, including loss of antigen presentation function of tumor cells, exhaustion of CD8+T and extracellular matrix secreted by fibroblasts to prevents immune infiltration, which leads to a poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, cell subgroups beneficial to anti-tumor immunity and the model developed by them remain to be further identified. Methods: In this clinical study of neoadjuvant therapy with anti-PD-1 in advanced melanoma, tumor tissues were collected before and after treatment for single-nucleus sequencing, and the results were verified using multicolor immunofluorescence staining and public datasets. Results: This study describes four cell subgroups which are closely associated with the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 treatment. It also describes a cell-cell communication network, in which the interaction of the four cell subgroups contributes to anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, we discuss a newly developed predictive model based on these four subgroups that holds significant potential for assessing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. Conclusions: These findings elucidate the primary mechanism of anti-PD-1 resistance and offer guidance for clinical drug administration for melanoma.","Sun W., Zhu Y., Zou Z., Wang L., Zhong J., Shen K., Lin X., Gao Z., Liu W., Li Y., Xu Y., Ren M., Hu T., Wei C., Gu J., Chen Y.",10.7150/thno.91626,Theranostics
Emerging Concepts Of Hybrid Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition In Cancer Progression,"Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process through which epithelial (E) cells lose their adherens junctions, transform into mesenchymal (M) cells and attain motility, leading to metastasis at distant organs. Nowadays, the concept of EMT has shifted from a binary phase of interconversion of pure E to M cells and vice versa to a spectrum of E/M transition states preferably coined as hybrid/partial/intermediate EMT. Hybrid EMT, being a plastic transient state, harbours cells which co-express both E and M markers and exhibit high tumourigenic properties, leading to stemness, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Several preclinical and clinical studies provided the evidence of co-existence of E/M phenotypes. Regulators including transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and phenotypic stability factors (PSFs) help in maintaining the hybrid state. Computational and bioinformatics approaches may be excellent for identifying new factors or combinations of regulatory elements that govern the different EMT transition states. Therapeutic intervention against hybrid E/M cells, though few, may evolve as a rational strategy against metastasis and drug resistance. This review has attempted to present the recent advancements on the concept and regulation of the process of hybrid EMT which generates hybrid E/M phenotypes, evidence of intermediate EMT in both preclinical and clinical setup, impact of partial EMT on promoting tumourigenesis, and future strategies which might be adapted to tackle this phenomenon.","Sinha D., Saha P., Samanta A., Bishayee A.",10.3390/biom10111561,Biomolecules
It Is Time To Define An Organizational Model For The Prevention And Management Of Infections Along The Surgical Pathway: A Worldwide Cross-Sectional Survey,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to investigate the organizational characteristics of acute care facilities worldwide in preventing and managing infections in surgery; assess participants' perception regarding infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, antibiotic prescribing practices, and source control; describe awareness about the global burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and IPC measures; and determine the role of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic on said awareness. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted contacting 1432 health care workers (HCWs) belonging to a mailing list provided by the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery. The self-administered questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team. The survey was open from May 22, 2021, and June 22, 2021. Three reminders were sent, after 7, 14, and 21 days. RESULTS: Three hundred four respondents from 72 countries returned a questionnaire, with an overall response rate of 21.2%. Respectively, 90.4% and 68.8% of participants stated their hospital had a multidisciplinary IPC team or a multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team. Local protocols for antimicrobial therapy of surgical infections and protocols for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis were present in 76.6% and 90.8% of hospitals, respectively. In 23.4% and 24.0% of hospitals no surveillance systems for surgical site infections and no monitoring systems of used antimicrobials were implemented. Patient and family involvement in IPC management was considered to be slightly or not important in their hospital by the majority of respondents (65.1%). Awareness of the global burden of AMR among HCWs was considered very important or important by 54.6% of participants. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered by 80.3% of respondents as a very important or important factor in raising HCWs awareness of the IPC programs in their hospital. Based on the survey results, the authors developed 15 statements for several questions regarding the prevention and management of infections in surgery. The statements may be the starting point for designing future evidence-based recommendations. CONCLUSION: Adequacy of prevention and management of infections in acute care facilities depends on HCWs behaviours and on the organizational characteristics of acute health care facilities to support best practices and promote behavioural change. Patient involvement in the implementation of IPC is still little considered. A debate on how operationalising a fundamental change to IPC, from being solely the HCWs responsibility to one that involves a collaborative relationship between HCWs and patients, should be opened.","Sartelli M., Labricciosa F.M., Coccolini F., Coimbra R., Abu-Zidan F.M., Ansaloni L., Al-Hasan M.N., Ansari S., Barie P.S., Caínzos M.A., Ceresoli M., Chiarugi M., Claridge J.A., Cicuttin E., Dellinger E.P., Fry D.E., Guirao X., Hardcastle T.C., Hecker A., Leppäniemi A.K., Litvin A., Marwah S., Maseda E., Mazuski J.E., Memish Z.A., Kirkpatrick A.W., Pagani L., Podda M., Rasa H.K., Sakakushev B.E., Sawyer R.G., Tumietto F., Xiao Y., Aboubreeg W.F., Adamou H., Akhmeteli L., Akin E., Alberio M.G., Alconchel F., Magagi I.A., Araúz A.B., Argenio G., Atanasov B.C., Atici S.D., Awad S.S., Baili E., Bains L., Bala M., Baraket O., Baral S., Belskii V.A., Benboubker M., Ben-Ishay O., Bordoni P., Boumédiène A., Brisinda G., Cavazzuti L., Chandy S.J., Chiarello M.M., Cillara N., Clarizia G., Cocuz M.-E., Cocuz I.G., Conti L., Coppola R., Cui Y., Czepiel J., D'Acapito F., Damaskos D., Das K., De Simone B., Delibegovic S., Demetrashvili Z., Detanac D.S., Dhingra S., Di Bella S., Dimitrov E.N., Dogjani A., D'Oria M., Dumitru I.M., Elmangory M.M., Enciu O., Fantoni M., Filipescu D., Fleres F., Foghetti D., Fransvea P., Gachabayov M., Galeiras R., Gattuso G., Ghannam W.M., Ghisetti V., Giraudo G., Gonfa K.B., Gonullu E., Hamad Y.T.E.Y., Hecker M., Isik A., Ismail N., Ismail A., Jain S.A., Kanj S.S., Kapoor G., Karaiskos I., Kavalakat A.J., Kenig J., Khamis F., Khokha V., Kiguba R., Kim J.I., Kobe Y., Kok K.Y.Y., Kovacevic B.M., Kryvoruchko I.A., Kuriyama A., Landaluce-Olavarria A., Lasithiotakis K., Lohsiriwat V., Lostoridis E., Luppi D., Vega G.M.M., Maegele M., Marinis A., Martines G., Martínez-Pérez A., Massalou D., Mesina C., Metan G., Miranda-Novales M.G., Mishra S.K., Mohamed M.I.H., Mohamedahmed A.Y.Y., Mora-Guzmán I., Mulita F., Musina A.-M., Navsaria P.H., Negoi I., Nita G.E., O'Connor D.B., Ordoñez C.A., Pantalone D., Panyko A., Papadopoulos A., Pararas N., Pata F., Patel T., Pellino G., Perra T., Perrone G., Pesce A., Pintar T., Popivanov G.I., Porcu A., Quiodettis M.A., Rahim R., Mitul A.R., Reichert M., Rems M., Campbell G.Y.R., Rocha-Pereira N., Rodrigues G., Villamil G.E.R., Rossi S., Sall I., Kafil H.S., Sasia D., Seni J., Seretis C., Serradilla-Martín M., Shelat V.G., Siribumrungwong B., Slavchev M., Solaini L., Tan B.K., Tarasconi A., Tartaglia D., Toma E.A., Tomadze G., Toro A., Tovani-Palone M.R., Van Goor H., Vasilescu A., Vereczkei A., Veroux M., Weckmann S.A., Widmer L.W., Yahya A., Zachariah S.K., Zakaria A.D., Zubareva N., Zuidema W.P., Di Carlo I., Cortese F., Baiocchi G.L., Maier R.V., Catena F.",10.1186/s13017-022-00420-4,World Journal Of Emergency Surgery : Wjes
"Shotgun Metagenomic Analyses Of Microbial Assemblages In The Aquatic Ecosystem Of Winam Gulf Of Lake Victoria, Kenya Reveals Multiclass Pollution","Lake Victoria, the second-largest freshwater lake in the world, provides an important source of food and income, particularly fish for both domestic consumption and for export market. In recent years, Lake Victoria has suffered massive pollution from both industrial and wastewater discharge. Microplastic biomes, pharmaceutical residues, drugs of abuse, heavy metals, agrochemicals, and personal care products are ubiquitous in the aquatic ecosystem of Winam Gulf. These pollutants are known to alter microbial assemblages in aquatic ecosystems with far-reaching ramification including a calamitous consequence to human health. Indeed, some of these pollutants have been associated with human cancers and antimicrobial resistance. There is a paucity of data on the microbial profiles of this important but heavily polluted aquatic ecosystem. The current study sought to investigate the metagenomic profiles of microbial assemblages in the Winam Gulf ecosystem. Water and sediment samples were collected from several locations within the study sites. Total genomic DNA pooled from all sampling sites was extracted and analyzed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Analyses revealed three major kingdoms: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes belonging to 3 phyla, 13 classes, 14 families, 9 orders, 14 genera, and 10 species. Proteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Comamonadaceae, Burkholdariales, and Arcobacter were the dominated phyla, class, family, order, genera, and species, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated the highest number of genes involved in metabolism. The presence of carbohydrate metabolism genes and enzymes was used to infer organic pollutions from sewage and agricultural runoffs. Similarly, the presence of xylene and nutrotoluene degradation genes and enzyme was used to infer industrial pollution into the lake. Drug metabolism genes lend credence to the possibility of pharmaceutical pollutants in water. Taken together, there is a clear indication of massive pollution. In addition, carbohydrate-active enzymes were the most abundant and included genes in glycoside hydrolases. Shotgun metagenomic analyses conveyed an understanding of the microbial communities of the massively polluted aquatic ecosystem of Winam Gulf, Lake Vicoria, Kenya. The current study documents the presence of multiclass pollutants in Lake Victoria and reveals information that might be useful for a potential bioremediation strategy using the native microbial communities.","Khatiebi S., Kiprotich K., Onyando Z., Wekesa C., Chi C.N., Mulambalah C., Okoth P.",10.1155/2023/3724531,Biomed Research International
Meta-Analysis Reveals Differential Impacts Of Microplastics On Soil Biota,"Contamination of microplastics (MPs) is a global environmental issue that has received much attention from the scientific and public communities due to ecological concerns in recent decades. Comparing with aquatic ecosystems, soil systems, regardless of the high importance and complexity, have been less studied under widely existing and increasing MP contamination. This review, combined with data assimilation and meta-analysis methods, has summarized current contamination conditions of soil MPs across different sites reported in earlier studies. While performing this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of MPs on soil biota including their numbers, biomass, diversity, and physiological properties. The results showed that abundance of soil MPs ranged from 0.34 to 410958.9 items kg(-1) and concentration ranged from 0.002 to 67500 mg kg(-1) across sites, with agricultural soils containing significantly lower abundance and concentration of MPs than others. Presence of MPs significantly decreased the individual number of soil biota, operational taxonomic unit, diversity index (Simpson), movement index and reproduction rate, whereas the mortality rate was significantly increased by the soil MPs. Despite these significant effects, MPs did not significantly alter the biomass of soil biota, which could be due to a counteraction of their negative and positive effects on different groups of soil organisms. Moreover, we observed that soil MPs could significantly increase the Chao1 index, suggesting that MPs may act as a food resource for the soil rare biosphere. Based on the existing knowledge, we suggest that future studies should focus on research areas that include but are not limited to methodological improvements, intensive field investigations, risk assessment from the perspective of soil food web and bioaccumulation, MPs induced antibiotic resistance, and restoration strategies to reduce their concentrations in soil.","Wei H., Wu L., Liu Z., Saleem M., Chen X., Xie J., Zhang J.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113150,Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety
Glucocorticoid Treatment Influences Prostate Cancer Cell Growth And The Tumor Microenvironment Via Altered Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling In Prostate Fibroblasts,"Despite significant therapeutic advances in recent years, treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains palliative, owing to the inevitable occurrence of drug resistance. There is increasing evidence that epithelial glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling and changes in the tumor-microenvironment (TME) play important roles in this process. Since glucocorticoids (GCs) are used as concomitant medications in the course of PCa treatment, it is essential to investigate the impact of GCs on stromal GR signaling in the TME. Therefore, general GR mRNA and protein expression was assessed in radical prostatectomy specimens and metastatic lesions. Elevated stromal GR signaling after GC treatment resulted in altered GR-target gene, soluble protein expression, and in a morphology change of immortalized and primary isolated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Subsequently, these changes affected proliferation, colony formation, and 3D-spheroid growth of multiple epithelial PCa cell models. Altered expression of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and adhesion-related proteins led to an ECM remodeling. Notably, androgen receptor pathway inhibitor treatments did not affect CAF viability. Our findings demonstrate that GC-mediated elevated GR signaling has a major impact on the CAF secretome and the ECM architecture. GC-treated fibroblasts significantly influence epithelial tumor cell growth and must be considered in future therapeutic strategies.","Eigentler A., Handle F., Schanung S., Degen A., Hackl H., Erb H.H.H., Fotakis G., Hoefer J., Ploner C., Jöhrer K., Heidegger I., Pircher A., Klotz W., Herold M., Schäfer G., Culig Z., Puhr M.",10.1038/s41388-023-02901-5,Oncogene
Chemoresistance Is Mediated By Ovarian Cancer Leader Cells In Vitro,"Background: Leader cells are a subset of cancer cells that coordinate the complex cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions required for ovarian cancer migration, invasion, tumour deposition and are negatively associated with progression-free survival and response to therapy. Emerging evidence suggests leader cells may be enriched in response to chemotherapy, underlying disease recurrence following treatment. Methods: CRISPR was used to insert a bicistronic T2A-GFP cassette under the native KRT14 (leader cell) promoter. 2D and 3D drug screens were completed in the presence of chemotherapies used in ovarian cancer management. Leader cell; proliferative (Ki67); and apoptotic status (Cleaved Caspase 3) were defined by live cell imaging and flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR defined “stemness” profiles. Proliferation was assessed on the xCELLigence real time cell analyser. Statistical Analysis was performed using unpaired non-parametric t-tests or one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc. Results: Leader cells represent a transcriptionally plastic subpopulation of ovarian cancer cells that arise independently of cell division or DNA replication, and exhibit a “stemness” profile that does not correlate with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Chemotherapeutics increased apoptosis-resistant leader cells in vitro, who retained motility and expressed known chemo-resistance markers including ALDH1, Twist and CD44v6. Functional impairment of leader cells restored chemosensitivity, with leader cell-deficient lines failing to recover following chemotherapeutic intervention. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that ovarian cancer leader cells are resistant to a diverse array of chemotherapeutic agents, and are likely to play a critical role in the recurrence of chemo-resistant disease as drivers of poor treatment outcomes.","Karimnia N., Wilson A.L., Green E., Matthews A., Jobling T.W., Plebanski M., Bilandzic M., Stephens A.N.",10.1186/s13046-021-02086-3,Journal Of Experimental And Clinical Cancer Research
Mycoplasma Genitalium In Symptomatic Male Urethritis: Macrolide Use Is Associated With Increased Resistance,"Background. Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) causes symptomatic urethritis in men, and can infect alone or together with other sexually transmitted infection (STI) agents. Methods. The prevalence of MG and other STIs was determined in 1816 men with symptomatic urethritis. Resistance of MG to macrolides and fluoroquinolones was determined by sequencing; the impact of recent antimicrobial usage on the distribution of MG single or mixed infections was determined. Results. Overall, prevalence of MG infection was 19.7% (358/1816). Fifty-four percent (166/307) of MG infections occurred alone in the absence of other STI agents. Men with single MG infection self-administered or were prescribed antibiotics more often in the 30 days prior to enrollment than subjects with urethritis caused by MG coinfection (P < .0001). Higher rates (96.7%) of infection with macrolide resistance in MG were identified in men who had taken macrolides prior to enrollment (P < .03). Overall, 88.9% (303/341) of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes contained mutations responsible for macrolide resistance; 89.5% (308/344) of parC and 12.4% (42/339) of gyrA genes had mutations responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance. Approximately 88% (270/308) of MG had combined mutations in 23S rRNA and parC genes; 10.4% (32/308) had mutations in all 3 genes. Conclusions. MG was the single pathogen identified in 11% of men with symptomatic urethritis. Overall, nearly 90% of MG infections were resistant to macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Men who took macrolides in the 30 days prior to enrollment had higher rates (97%) of macrolide-resistant MG. Resistance was associated with numerous mutations in 23SrRNA, parC, and gyrA genes.","Li Y., Su X., Le W., Li S., Yang Z., Chaisson C., Madico G., Gong X., Reed G.W., Wang B., Rice P.A.",10.1093/cid/ciz294,Clinical Infectious Diseases
T Cells Isolated From Patients With Checkpoint Inhibitor-Resistant Melanoma Are Functional And Can Mediate Tumor Regression,"Background: Almost half of the patients with metastatic melanoma obtain only short-term or no benefit at all from checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether the immune system of patients progressing following CPI treatment was able to generate functional tumor-specific immune responses. Materials and methods: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated and expanded from metastatic melanoma lesions which progressed during or after anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD)-1 and anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) treatment. Tumor-specific immune responses were assessed with co-culture assays of TILs and autologous tumor cells. Results: TILs from 23 metastases of individual patients could be assessed for T cells recognition of autologous tumor cells. All metastases were progressive on or following anti-PD-1 (23/23, 100%), and the majority also after anti-CTLA-4 (17/23, 74%). Functional antitumor immune responses were detected in 19/23 patients (83%). Both CD8(+) (in 18/23 patients, 78%) and CD4(+) (in 16/23 patients, 70%) TILs were able to recognize autologous tumors. A large fraction of CD8(+) TILs (median 23%, range 1.0%- 84%) recognized tumor cells. This is similar to the cohorts of unselected patient populations with metastatic melanoma presented in previous studies. The localization of intratumoral immune infiltrates was heterogeneous among samples. In a phase I/II clinical trial, TILs were administered with lymphodepleting chemotherapy, pegIFNa2b and interleukin-2 to 12 patients with CPI-resistant melanoma. Out of 12 patients who previously failed CPI therapy, treatment with TILs resulted in two partial responses, of which one is ongoing. Conclusions: Tumor-reactive T cells appear to heavily infiltrate the tumor microenvironment of patients who failed previous CPI treatment. These patients can still respond to an infusion of unselected autologous TILs. Our results warrant further testing of novel immune re-activation strategies in melanoma patients who failed multiple CPI therapy.","Andersen R., Borch T.H., Draghi A., Gokuldass A., Rana A.H.M., Pedersen M., Nielsen M., Kongsted P., Kjeldsen J.W., Westergaard C.W.M., Radic H.D., Chamberlain C.A., Hölmich L.R., Hendel H.W., Larsen M.S., Met O., Svane I.M., Donia M.",10.1093/annonc/mdy139,Annals Of Oncology
Establishment And Characterization Of A Patient-Derived Metastatic Extraskeletal Ewing Sarcoma Cell Line Es-Zss-1,"The methods available for treating metastatic Ewing sarcoma (ES) are inadequate; thus, innovative therapeutic approaches need to be developed. However, the lack of clinically relevant ES models has hindered the discovery of drugs for this disease. In this study, we established and characterized a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line model, which was constructed using tumor tissue from a patient with metastatic extraskeletal ES. The cells were found to recapitulate the morphological and histopathological features of the patient tumor and were designated as ES-ZSS-1. The cells harbor the characteristic EWSR1-FLI1 infusion and underwent successive passages in vitro. By performing gene expression profiling, we found that the mutation in STAG2 was the most frequent. An increase in Twist1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was recorded. These genetic features might be relevant to metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. To summarize, the novel patient-derived ES cell line we developed closely mimics the phenotype and genotype of patient tumors, making it a reliable tool for research on metastatic ES.","Zhang C., Liu M., Luan L., Guo X., You Y., Wang Z., Li W., Lu N., Hou Y., Lu L., Lu W., Zhou Y.",10.1007/s13577-024-01133-3,Human Cell
Curcumin Suppresses Cell Proliferation And Triggers Apoptosis In Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma Cells By Downregulating The Egfr Signaling Pathway,"Melanoma is a malignant tumor with aggressive behavior. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, is clinically used in melanoma, but resistance to melanoma cytotoxic therapies is associated with BRAF mutations. Curcumin can effectively inhibit numerous types of cancers. However, there are no reports regarding the correlation between curcumin and vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. In this study, vemurafenib-resistant A375.S2 (A375.S2/VR) cells were established, and the functional mechanism of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), serine–threonine kinase (AKT), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling induced by curcumin was investigated in A375.S2/VR cells in vitro. Our results indicated that A375.S2/VR cells had a higher IC(50) concentration of vemurafenib than the parental A375.S2 cells. Moreover, curcumin reduced the viability and confluence of A375.S2/VR cells. Curcumin triggered apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and intrinsic signaling (caspase-9/-3-dependent) pathways in A375.S2/VR cells. Curcumin-induced apoptosis was also mediated by the EGFR signaling pathway. Combination treatment with curcumin and gefitinib (an EGFR inhibitor) synergistically potentiated the inhibitory effect of cell viability in A375.S2/VR cells. The present study provides new insights into the therapy of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma and suggests that curcumin might be an encouraging therapeutic candidate for its drug-resistant treatment.","Chiu Y.-J., Yang J.-S., Tsai F.-J., Chiu H.-Y., Juan Y.-N., Lo Y.-H., Chiang J.-H.",10.1002/tox.23450,Environmental Toxicology
Expert Consensus On The Treatment Of Oral And Maxillofacial Space Infections,"Oral and maxillofacial space infections (OMSI) are common diseases of the facial region involving fascial spaces.

Targeting The Glucocorticoid Receptor Signature Gene Mono Amine Oxidase-A Enhances The Efficacy Of Chemo- And Anti-Androgen Therapy In Advanced Prostate Cancer,"Despite increasing options for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, development of drug resistance is inevitable. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a prime suspect for acquired therapy resistance, as prostate cancer (PCa) cells are able to increase GR signaling during anti-androgen therapy and thereby circumvent androgen receptor (AR)-blockade and cell death. As standard AR-directed therapies fail to block the GR and GR inhibitors might result in intolerable side effects, the identification of GR signature genes, which are better suited for a targeted approach, is of clinical importance. Therefore, the specific epithelial and stromal GR signature was determined in cancer-associated fibroblasts as well as in abiraterone and enzalutamide-resistant cells after glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Microarray and ChIP analysis identified MAO-A as a directly up-regulated mutual epithelial and stromal GR target, which is induced after GC treatment and during PCa progression. Elevated MAO-A levels were confirmed in in vitro cell models, in primary tissue cultures after GC treatment, and in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GCs. MAO-A expression correlates with GR/AR activity as well as with a reduced progression-free survival. Pharmacological MAO-A inhibition combined with 2(nd) generation AR signaling inhibitors or chemotherapeutics results in impaired growth of androgen-dependent, androgen-independent, and long-term anti-androgen-treated cells. In summary, these findings demonstrate that targeting MAO-A represents an innovative therapeutic strategy to synergistically block GR and AR dependent PCa cell growth and thereby overcome therapy resistance.","Puhr M., Eigentler A., Handle F., Hackl H., Ploner C., Heidegger I., Schaefer G., Brandt M.P., Hoefer J., Van Der Pluijm G., Klocker H.",10.1038/s41388-021-01754-0,Oncogene
Exosomal Mir-27A-3P Derived From Tumor-Associated Macrophage Suppresses Propranolol Sensitivity In Infantile Hemangioma,"Propranolol is the first-line drug for infantile hemangioma (IH) therapy, whereas propranolol resistance is clinically observed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)-derived exosomes may deliver biological molecules to promote tumor progression. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between TAMs-derived exosomal miR-27a-3p and propranolol sensitivity in IH. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 7 days to get unactivated macrophages (Un-Mac), which were further treated with IL-4 and IL-13 to induce M2 polarized macrophages. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of M2 macrophage, followed by identification. Cell co-culture and/or transfection were performed to explore whether M2 polarized macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-exos) could mediate the crosstalk between TAMs-derived miR-27a-3p and hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs). In addition, nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with HemSCs pretreated with or without M2-Exos to examine the effects of M2-Exos on IH in vivo. M2 polarized macrophages inhibited propranolol sensitivity of HemSCs, as shown by the increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis. miR-27a-3p was upregulated in M2 polarized macrophages and M2-Exos. Moreover, M2-exos delivered miR-27a-3p from macrophages to HemSCs and subsequently reduced propranolol sensitivity. Luciferase reporter and biotin-RNA pulldown assay proved that dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2) was the direct target of miR-27a-3p. These results demonstrate that M2-exos could deliver miR-27a-3p from macrophages to HemSCs to reduce the sensitivity of HemSCs to propranolol by down-regulating DKK2 expression, and exosomal miR-27a-3p and DKK2 in HemSCs could be considered as treatment targets.","Liu C., Zhao Z., Guo S., Zhang L., Fan X., Zheng J.",10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104442,Cellular Immunology
Berberis Orthobotrys – A Promising Herbal Anti-Tumorigenic Candidate For The Treatment Of Pediatric Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Berberis orthobotrys (BORM) is a medical plant with a long history in traditional usage for the treatment of wounds, cancer, gastrointestinal malady and several other diseases. Our previous studies identified the endemic Pakistani plant Berberis orthobotrys Bien. ex Aitch. as promising source for the treatment of breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Aim of the study: The present study was aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer properties of 26 plant derived extracts and compounds including the methanolic root extract of Berberis orthobotrys (BORM) on pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA), which is known to develop drug resistance, metastatic invasion and potential tumor progression. Materials and methods: The main anti-tumor activity of BORM was verified by focusing on morphological, cell structural and metabolic alterations via metabolic profiling, cell viability measurements, flow cytometry, western blotting and diverse microscopy-based methods using the human RMA cell line Rh30. Results: Exposure of 25 µg/ml BORM exerts an influence on the cell stability, the degradation of oncosomes as well as the shutdown of the metabolic activity of RMA cells, primarily by downregulation of the energy metabolism. Therefore glycyl-aspartic acid and N-acetyl serine decreased moderately, and uracil increased intracellularly. On healthy, non-transformed muscle cells BORM revealed very low metabolic alterations and nearly no cytotoxic impact. Furthermore, BORM is also capable to reduce Rh30 cell migration (~50%) and proliferation (induced G2/M cycle arrest) as well as to initiate apoptosis confirmed by reduced Bcl-2, Bax and PCNA expression and induced PARP-1 cleavage. Conclusions: The study provides the first evidence, that BORM treatment is effective against RMA cells with low side effects on healthy cells.","Adamus A., Peer K., Ali I., Lisec J., Falodun A., Frank M., Seitz G., Engel N.",10.1016/j.jep.2018.10.002,Journal Of Ethnopharmacology
Proteomics And Transcriptomics Explore The Effect Of Mixture Of Herbal Extract On Diabetic Wound Healing Process,"BACKGROUND: The annual incidence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) has been reported to vary from 0.2% to 11% in diabetes-specific clinical settings and less than 0.1% to 8% in community- and population-based cohorts. According to the International Diabetes Foundation, approximately 40 million to 60 million people worldwide are affected by DFUs, and a recent meta-analysis indicates a global prevalence of 6.3% among adults with diabetes, or about 33 million individuals. The cost of diabetes care is significant, amounting to $273 billion in direct and $90 billion in indirect expenses annually, in America. Foot complications in diabetes care excess annual expenditures ranging from 50% to 200% above the baseline cost of diabetes-related care. The cost of advanced-stage ulcers can be more than $50,000 per wound episode, and the direct expenses of major amputation are even higher. DFUs can be treated using various methods, including wound dressings, antibiotics, pressure-off loading, skin substitutes, stem cells, debridement, topical oxygen therapy, gene therapy and growth factors. For severe DFUs patients are at risk of amputation if treatment is not timely or appropriate. Amputating limbs not only causes physical pain to patients, but also brings economic burden due to lost productivity, and decreased employment linked to DFUs. Currently, long-term use of local antibiotics in clinical practice is prone to induce drug resistance, while growth factors do not effectively inhibit bacterial growth and control inflammation in wounds. Stem cell and gene therapies are still in the experimental stage. The method of local debridement combined with negative pressure therapy is expensive. Therefore, we urgently need an affordable, non-surgical method to treat diabetic ulcers. Extracts of bark of Bauhinia purpurea, Paeoniae rubrae, Angelica dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav. (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., Acorus calamus L, and Radix Angelicae biseratae have been used as traditional remedies to treat inflammation-related diseases and cutaneous wounds due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to promote vascular renewal. However, there have been few studies on the mixture of these five herbal extracts on diabetic wound healing. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the healing effect of a mixture of five aforementioned herbal extracts on diabetic ulcer wounds in rats, and to reveal the potential mechanisms behind any potential wound healing using transcriptomics and proteomics. STUDY DESIGN: We designed the experiment to explore the effects of five herbal extracts on diabetic wound healing process through in vivo experiments and to investigate the underlying mechanisms through proteomics and transcriptomics. METHODS: We used a mixture of five aforementioned herbal extract to treat rat model of diabetic established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and a 2 × 2 cm round full-thickness skin defect was created on the back of the rat. Staphylococcus aureus (1 ml of 1.5 × 109 cfu/ml) was evenly applied to the wound. The wound was then observed for 72 h. The infected ulcer model of diabetic rats was considered to be successfully established if the wound was found to be infected with S. aureus. According to different medications, the rats were divided into three groups, namely mixture of herbal extract (MHE), Kangfuxin solution (KFS) and control (Ctrl). The effects of the medicine on wound healing were observed. HE staining and Masson staining were performed to evaluate the histopathological changes and collagen synthesis. IHC staining was used to assess the neovascularization, and M2 macrophage proliferation was determined by immunofluorescence staining. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies were performed to explore potential mechanism of five herbal extracts to promote wound healing. UHPLC-QE-MS was performed to identify the chemical composition of mixture of herbal extract. RESULTS: The study show that the mixed herbal extract promotes angiogenesis, proliferation of M2 macrophages, and collagen synthesis. Transcriptomics showed that rno-miR-1298, rno-miR-144-5p, and rno-miR-92a-1-5p are vital miRNAs which also play a significant role in role in regulating wound healing. Proteomics results showed that the following proteins were important in wounds treated with MHE: Rack1, LOC100362366, Cops2, Cops6, Eif4e, Eif3c, Rpl12, Srp54, Rpl13 and Lsm7. Autophagy, PI3-Akt and mTOR signaling pathways were enriched after treatment with MHE compared to other groups. CONCLUSION: Herein, we have shown that MHE containing extracts of bark of Bauhinia purpurea, P. rubrae, A. dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., A. calamus L, and R. A. biseratae has significant wound healing effects in the diabetic ulcer wound rat model. These results suggest that local application of MHE in diabetic wounds can accelerate the wound healing process. Moreover, in vivo experiments revealed that the diabetic wound healing process was primarily mediated by angiogenesis and M2 macrophage transition. Therefore, this study may provide a promising and non-surgical therapeutic strategy to accelerate diabetic wound healing, thereby decreasing the number of limb amputations in diabetic patients.","Liu Y., Zhang X., Yang L., Zhou S., Li Y., Shen Y., Lu S., Zhou J., Liu Y.",10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154892,Phytomedicine : International Journal Of Phytotherapy And Phytopharmacology
Mechanism Of Nanoplastics Capture By Jellyfish Mucin And Its Potential As A Sustainable Water Treatment Technology,"The accumulation of nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has raised concerns about their impact on human health and the biosphere. The main aim of this study is to understand the mechanism that governs the capture of NPs by jellyfish mucus extracted from the jellyfish Aurelia sp. (A.a.) and compare the capture/removal efficiency to that of conventional coagulants and mucus from other organisms. The efficacy of A.a mucus to capture polystyrene and acrylic NPs (∼100 nm) from spiked wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was evaluated. The mucus effect on capture kinetics and destabilization of NPs of different polymer compositions, sizes and concentrations was quantified by means of fluorescent NPs, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. A dosing of A.a. mucus equivalent to protein concentrations of ∼2–4 mg L(−1) led to a rapid change in zeta potential from a baseline of −30 mV to values close to 0 mV, indicating a marked change from a stable to a non-stable dispersion leading to a rapid (<10 min) and significant removal of NPs (60 %–90 %) from a stable suspension. The A.a. mucus outperformed all other mucus types (0–37 %) and coagulants (0 %–32 % for ferric chloride; 23–40 % for poly aluminum chlorohydrate), highlighting the potential for jellyfish mucus to be used as bio-flocculant. The results indicate a mucus-particle interaction consisting of adsorption-bridging and “mesh” filtration. Further insight is provided by carbohydrate composition and protein disruption analysis. Total protein disruption resulted in a complete loss of the A.a. mucus capacity to capture NPs, while the breaking of disulfide bonds and protein unfolding resulted in improved capture capacity. The study demonstrates that natural jellyfish mucin can capture and remove NPs in water and wastewater treatment systems more efficiently than conventional coagulants, highlighting the potential for development of a new type of bio-flocculant.","Ben-David E.A., Habibi M., Haddad E., Sammar M., Angel D.L., Dror H., Lahovitski H., Booth A.M., Sabbah I.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161824,Science Of The Total Environment
Effects Of Erythromycin On Biofilm Formation And Resistance Mutation Of Escherichia Coli On Pristine And Uv-Aged Polystyrene Microplastics,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics co-occur widely in the environment and pose combined risk to microbial communities. The present study investigated the effects of erythromycin on biofilm formation and resistance mutation of a model bacterium, E. coli, on the surface of pristine and UV-aged polystyrene (PS) MPs sized 1–2 mm. The properties of UV-aged PS were significantly altered compared to pristine PS, with notable increases in specific surface area, carbonyl index, hydrophilicity, and hydroxyl radical content. Importantly, the adsorption capacity of UV-aged PS towards erythromycin was approximately 8-fold higher than that of pristine PS. Biofilms colonizing on UV-aged PS had a greater cell count (5.6 × 10(8) CFU mg(−1)) and a higher frequency of resistance mutation (1.0 × 10(−7)) than those on pristine PS (1.4 × 10(8) CFU mg(−1) and 1.4 × 10(−8), respectively). Moreover, erythromycin at 0.1 and 1.0 mg L (−)(1) significantly (p < 0.05) promoted the formation and resistance mutation of biofilm on both pristine and UV-aged PS. DNA sequencing results confirmed that the biofilm resistance was attributed to point mutations in rpoB segment of the bacterial genome. qPCR results demonstrated that both UV aging and erythromycin repressed the expression levels of a global regulator rpoS in biofilm bacteria, as well as two DNA mismatch repair genes mutS and uvrD, which was likely to contribute to increased resistance mutation frequency.","Han X., Fu L., Yu J., Li K., Deng Z., Shu R., Wang D., You J., Zeng E.Y.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121628,Water Research
Cyp2C19 Polymorphism Is Associated With Amputation Rates In Patients Taking Clopidogrel After Endovascular Intervention For Critical Limb Ischaemia,"Objective: Clopidogrel is a pro-drug requiring cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme to be oxidised to its active form. This study evaluated the association between the CYP 2C19 genetic polymorphism and clinical outcomes in patients with critical limb ischaemia (CLI) taking clopidogrel after endovascular therapy (EVT). Methods: This was a retrospective study. Patients with CLI who had undergone EVT between August 2014 and January 2017 were included. The study subjects were divided into three groups according to the loss of function (LOF) CYP2C19 alleles: (1) extensive metaboliser (EM); (2) intermediate metaboliser (IM); and (3) poor metaboliser (PM). All patients underwent a platelet function test (VerifyNow). Amputation free survival and all cause mortality were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The association between baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes was assessed with the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 278 CLI patients (EM: 153, IM: 79, PM: 46) who underwent EVT were included. There were 180/278 (64.7%, EM: 107, IM: 45, PM: 28) patients who completed the 12 month follow up examination. Carriers of at least one CYP2C19 LOF allele (44.9%, 125/278) had diminished pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel as measured using VerifyNow (174 ± 27 platelet reactivity units (PRU), 216 ± 21 PRU, and 245 ± 35 PRU for patients with EM, IM, and PM CYP2C19 profiles, respectively; EM vs. IM, p < .0001 and EM vs. PM, p < .0001). The estimated amputation free 12 month survival rates were EM 82.1%, IM 66.1.0%, and PM 56.6% with significant differences between groups (log-rank test p = .0006, p for trend <.0001). The estimated all cause 12 month mortality rates were EM 83.7%, IM 72.2%, and PM 71.3% (log rank test p = .01, p for trend p = .007). The combined group consisting of IM and PM was associated with amputation free survival and all cause mortality based on a univariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.23 [1.97–2.46], p = .011; HR = 1.43 [1.05–1.85], p = .043) and remained significant in a multivariable Cox analysis (HR = 2.65 [2.1–2.9], p = .009; HR = 1.39 [1.07–1.74], p = .037). Conclusion: CYP2C19 genetic profiles can significantly influence clinical outcomes (in both amputation free survival and all cause mortality) in CLI patients who are taking only clopidogrel after EVT.","Lee J., Cheng N., Tai H., Jimmy Juang J., Wu C., Lin L., Hwang J., Lin J., Chiang F., Tsai C.",10.1016/j.ejvs.2019.02.011,European Journal Of Vascular And Endovascular Surgery
Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts In Mycosis Fungoides Promote Tumor Cell Migration And Drug Resistance Through Cxcl12/Cxcr4,"Cancer cells are known to reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to act as tumor supporters. The presence and role of CAFs in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, are unknown. This study sought to characterize CAFs in MF and their cross talk with the lymphoma cells using primary fibroblast cultures from punch biopsies of patients with early-stage MF and healthy subjects. MF cultures yielded significantly increased levels of FAPα, a CAF marker, and CAF-associated genes and proteins: CXCL12 (ligand of CXCR4 expressed on MF cells), collagen XI, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. Cultured MF fibroblasts showed greater proliferation than normal fibroblasts in ex vivo experiments. A coculture with MyLa cells (MF cell line) increased normal fibroblast growth, reduced the sensitivity of MyLa cells to doxorubicin, and enhanced their migration. Inhibiting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of MyLa cells and reduced MyLa cell motility. Our data suggest that the fibroblasts in MF lesions are more proliferative than fibroblasts in normal skin and that CAFs protect MF cells from doxorubicin-induced cell death and increase their migration through the secretion of CXCL12. Reversing the CAF-mediated tumor microenvironment in MF may improve the efficiency of anticancer therapy.","Aronovich A., Moyal L., Gorovitz B., Amitay-Laish I., Naveh H.P., Forer Y., Maron L., Knaneh J., Ad-El D., Yaacobi D., Barel E., Erez N., Hodak E.",10.1016/j.jid.2020.06.034,Journal Of Investigative Dermatology
Exploring Olfactory Receptor Family 7 Subfamily C Member 1 As A Novel Oral Cancer Stem Cell Target For Immunotherapy,"The mortality rate of oral cancer has not improved over the past three decades despite remarkable advances in cancer therapies. Oral cancers contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that share characteristics associated with normal stem cells, including self-renewal and multi-differentiation potential. CSCs are tumorigenic, play a critical role in cancer infiltration, recurrence, and distant metastasis, and significantly contribute to drug resistance to current therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy. Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are key immune cells that effectively recognize peptide antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Increasing evidence suggests that cancer antigen-specific targeting by CTLs effectively regulates CSCs that drive cancer progression. In this study, we utilized data from public domains and performed various bioassays on human oral squamous cell carcinoma clinical samples and cell lines, including HSC-2 and HSC-3, to investigate the potential role of olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily C member 1 (OR7C1), a seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled olfactory receptor that is also expressed in nonolfactory tissues and was previously reported as a novel marker and target of colon cancer initiating cell-targeted immunotherapy, in CSC-targeted treatment against oral cancer. We found that the OR7C1 gene was expressed only in oral CSCs, and that CTLs reacted with human leukocyte antigen-A24-restricted OR7C1 oral CSC-specific peptides. Taken together, our findings suggest that OR7C1 represents a novel target for potent CSC-targeted immunotherapy in oral cancer.","Miyamoto S., Hirohashi Y., Morita R., Miyazaki A., Ogi K., Kanaseki T., Ide K., Shirakawa J., Tsukahara T., Murai A., Sasaya T., Koike K., Kina S., Kawano T., Goto T., Ntege E.H., Shimizu Y., Torigoe T.",10.1111/cas.15873,Cancer Science
Combinatory Effect Of Ala-Pdt And Itraconazole Treatment For Trichosporon Asahii,"Background and Objectives: Trichosporiosis is an opportunistic infection that includes superficial infections, white piedra, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and invasive trichosporonosis. The effect of antifungal agents against these infections is largely weakened by drug resistance and biofilms-related virulence. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new therapeutic approach developed not only to combat cancerous lesions but also to treat infectious diseases such as fungal infections. However, there are few studies on the antimicrobial mechanism of 5-aminolevulinic acid PDT (ALA-PDT) in treating Trichosporon. In this work, we explored the possibility of combining ALA-PDT with an antifungal agent to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Trichosporon asahii (T. asahii) in a clinical setting and in vitro. Study Design/Materials and Methods: The biofilms of T. asahii were constructed by a 96-well plate-based method in vitro. The planktonic and adherent T. asahii were exposed to different concentrations of photosensitizers and different light doses. After PDT treatment, counting colony-forming units and tetrazolium (XTT) reduction assay were used to estimate the antifungal efficacy. The minimal inhibitory concentration of itraconazole before and after PDT treatment was determined by the broth dilution method, and XTT viability assay was used to detect and evaluate the synergistic potential of ALA-PDT and itraconazole combinations in inhibiting biofilms. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to assess the disruption of biofilms. Results: Using combination therapy, we have successfully treated a patient who had a T. asahii skin infection. Further in vitro studies showed that the antifungal effect of ALA-PDT on planktonic and adherent T. asahii was dependent on the concentration of ALA and light dosages used. We also found that the sensitivity of both planktonic and biofilm cells to itraconazole were increased after ALA-PDT. Synergistic effect were observed for biofilms in ALA-PDT and itraconazole-combined treatment. The disruption of biofilms was confirmed by SEM, suggesting that ALA-PDT effectively damaged the biofilms and the destruction was further enhanced by ALA-PDT combination of antifungal agents. Conclusions: In conclusion, these data suggest that ALA-PDT could be an alternative strategy for controlling infections caused by Trichosporon. The combination therapy of ALA-PDT with itraconazole could result in increased elimination of planktonic cells and biofilms compared with single therapy. All these findings indicate that it could be a promising treatment against trichosporonosis. Lasers Surg.

"Melanoma: Molecular Genetics, Metastasis, Targeted Therapies, Immunotherapies, And Therapeutic Resistance","Cutaneous melanoma is a common cancer and cases have steadily increased since the mid 70s. For some patients, early diagnosis and surgical removal of melanomas is lifesaving, while other patients typically turn to molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapies as treatment options. Easy sampling of melanomas allows the scientific community to identify the most prevalent mutations that initiate melanoma such as the BRAF, NRAS, and TERT genes, some of which can be therapeutically targeted. Though initially effective, many tumors acquire resistance to the targeted therapies demonstrating the need to investigate compensatory pathways. Immunotherapies represent an alternative to molecular targeted therapies. However, inter-tumoral immune cell populations dictate initial therapeutic response and even tumors that responded to treatment develop resistance in the long term. As the protocol for combination therapies develop, so will our scientific understanding of the many pathways at play in the progression of melanoma. The future direction of the field may be to find a molecule that connects all of the pathways. Meanwhile, noncoding RNAs have been shown to play important roles in melanoma development and progression. Studying noncoding RNAs may help us to understand how resistance – both primary and acquired – develops; ultimately allow us to harness the true potential of current therapies. This review will cover the basic structure of the skin, the mutations and pathways responsible for transforming melanocytes into melanomas, the process by which melanomas metastasize, targeted therapeutics, and the potential that noncoding RNAs have as a prognostic and treatment tool.","Wagstaff W., Mwamba R.N., Grullon K., Armstrong M., Zhao P., Hendren-Santiago B., Qin K.H., Li A.J., Hu D.A., Youssef A., Reid R.R., Luu H.H., Shen L., He T.-C., Haydon R.C.",10.1016/j.gendis.2022.04.004,Genes And Diseases
Braf(V600E)/P-Erk/P-Drp1(Ser616) Promotes Tumor Progression And Reprogramming Of Glucose Metabolism In Papillary Thyroid Cancer,"Background: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with the BRAF(V600E) mutation is associated with a poorer prognosis. BRAF inhibitors may demonstrate limited efficacy due to emerging drug resistance. The Warburg effect may have cancer therapeutic implications. It is not known if the BRAF(V600E) mutation is associated with altered glucose metabolism in PTC. Methods: This study examined the effect of BRAF(V600E) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) on various cellular processes in PTC cells, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, mitochondrial fission, glucose metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis. We used RT-qPCR to assess the expression of key glycolytic enzymes in thyroid cancer tissues. Additionally, the regulatory interaction between BRAF(V600E) and DRP1 was investigated through Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. We further evaluated the impact of DRP1 in PTC and the inhibitory effects of dabrafenib and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) in vitro and in vivo. Results: We found that the BRAF(V600E) mutation significantly augments aerobic glycolysis while suppressing oxidative phosphorylation in PTC. We identified the BRAF(V600E)/p-ERK/p-DRP1(Ser616) signaling pathway as a critical mediator in PTC progression. First, the BRAF(V600E)/p-ERK/p-DRP1(Ser616) signaling pathway enhances cell proliferation by upregulating hexokinase 2 expression and thereby increasing aerobic glycolysis. Second, it inhibits apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial fission and reducing ROS levels. Moreover, we demonstrated that the combination therapy of 2-DG and dabrafenib markedly impedes the progression of BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC. Conclusion: The BRAF(V600E)/p-ERK/p-DRP1(Ser616) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism reprogramming, contributing to the aggressiveness and progression of BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC. Our findings suggest that a combined therapeutic approach using 2-DG and dabrafenib has the potential to improve the outcome of PTC patients with BRAF(V600E).","Wen S.-S., Wu Y.-J., Wang J.-Y., Ni Z.-X., Dong S., Xie X.-J., Wang Y.-T., Wang Y., Huang N.-S., Ji Q.-H., Ma B., Qu N.",10.1089/thy.2023.0700,Thyroid
Microrna-16 Restores Sensitivity To Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors And Outperforms Mek Inhibitors In Kras-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Chemotherapy, the treatment of choice in non-operable cases, achieves a dismal success rate, raising the need for new therapeutic options. In about 25% of NSCLC, the activating mutations of the KRAS oncogene define a subclass that cannot benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The tumor suppressor miR-16 is downregulated in many human cancers, including NSCLC. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate miR-16 treatment to restore the TKI sensitivity and compare its efficacy to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutated NSCLC. Methods: We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate whether miR-16 could be exploited to overcome TKI resistance in KRAS-mutated NSCLC. We had three goals: first, to identify the KRAS downstream effectors targeted by mir-16, second, to study the effects of miR-16 restoration on TKI resistance in KRAS-mutated NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo, and finally, to compare miR-16 and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in reducing KRAS-mutated NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo. Results: We demonstrated that miR-16 directly targets the three KRAS downstream effectors MAPK3, MAP2K1, and CRAF in NSCLC, restoring the sensitivity to erlotinib in KRAS-mutated NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. We also provided evidence that the miR-16–erlotinib regimen is more effective than the selumetinib–erlotinib combination in KRAS-mutated NSCLC. Conclusions: Our findings support the biological preclinical rationale for using miR-16 in combination with erlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC with KRAS-activating mutations.","Fanini F., Bandini E., Plousiou M., Carloni S., Wise P., Neviani P., Murtadha M., Foca F., Fabbri F., Vannini I., Fabbri M.",10.3390/ijms222413357,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Cholesterol Biosynthesis Pathway As A Novel Mechanism Of Resistance To Estrogen Deprivation In Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer,"Background: Therapies targeting estrogenic stimulation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) reduce mortality, but resistance remains a major clinical problem. Molecular studies have shown few high-frequency mutations to be associated with endocrine resistance. In contrast, expression profiling of primary ER+ BC samples has identified several promising signatures/networks for targeting. Methods: To identify common adaptive mechanisms associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs), we assessed changes in global gene expression during adaptation to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) in a panel of ER+ BC cell lines cultured in 2D on plastic (MCF7, T47D, HCC1428, SUM44 and ZR75.1) or in 3D on collagen (MCF7) to model the stromal compartment. Furthermore, dimethyl labelling followed by LC-MS/MS was used to assess global changes in protein abundance. The role of target genes/proteins on proliferation, ER-mediated transcription and recruitment of ER to target gene promoters was analysed. Results: The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was the common upregulated pathway in the ER+ LTED but not the ER- LTED cell lines, suggesting a potential mechanism dependent on continued ER expression. Targeting the individual genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with siRNAs caused a 30-50 % drop in proliferation. Further analysis showed increased expression of 25-hydroxycholesterol (HC) in the MCF7 LTED cells. Exogenous 25-HC or 27-HC increased ER-mediated transcription and expression of the endogenous estrogen-regulated gene TFF1 in ER+ LTED cells but not in the ER- LTED cells. Additionally, recruitment of the ER and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the TFF1 and GREB1 promoters was increased upon treatment with 25-HC and 27-HC. In-silico analysis of two independent studies of primary ER+ BC patients treated with neoadjuvant AIs showed that increased expression of MSMO1, EBP, LBR and SQLE enzymes, required for cholesterol synthesis and increased in our in-vitro models, was significantly associated with poor response to endocrine therapy. Conclusion: Taken together, these data provide support for the role of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and the cholesterol metabolites, 25-HC and 27-HC, in a novel mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ BC that has potential as a therapeutic target.","Simigdala N., Gao Q., Pancholi S., Roberg-Larsen H., Zvelebil M., Ribas R., Folkerd E., Thompson A., Bhamra A., Dowsett M., Martin L.-A.",10.1186/s13058-016-0713-5,Breast Cancer Research
Monensin Inhibits Cell Proliferation And Tumor Growth Of Chemo-Resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cells By Targeting The Egfr Signaling Pathway,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly malignancies with <5% five-year survival rate due to late diagnosis, limited treatment options and chemoresistance. There is thus an urgent unmet clinical need to develop effective anticancer drugs to treat pancreatic cancer. Here, we study the potential of repurposing monensin as an anticancer drug for chemo-resistant pancreatic cancer. Using the two commonly-used chemo-resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2, we show that monensin suppresses cell proliferation and migration, and cell cycle progression, while solicits apoptosis in pancreatic cancer lines at a low micromole range. Moreover, monensin functions synergistically with gemcitabine or EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in suppressing cell growth and inducing cell death of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, monensin suppresses numerous cancer-associated pathways, such as E2F/DP1, STAT1/2, NFkB, AP-1, Elk-1/SRF, and represses EGFR expression in pancreatic cancer lines. Furthermore, the in vivo study shows that monensin blunts PDAC xenograft tumor growth by suppressing cell proliferation via targeting EGFR pathway. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that monensin can be repurposed as an effective anti-pancreatic cancer drug even though more investigations are needed to validate its safety and anticancer efficacy in pre-clinical and clinical models.","Wang X., Wu X., Zhang Z., Ma C., Wu T., Tang S., Zeng Z., Huang S., Gong C., Yuan C., Zhang L., Feng Y., Huang B., Liu W., Zhang B., Shen Y., Luo W., Wang X., Liu B., Lei Y., Ye Z., Zhao L., Cao D., Yang L., Chen X., Haydon R.C., Luu H.H., Peng B., Liu X., He T.-C.",10.1038/s41598-018-36214-5,Scientific Reports
The Effecting Mechanisms Of 100 Nm Sized Polystyrene Nanoplastics On The Typical Coastal Alexandrium Tamarense,"Due to the increase in nanoplastics (NPs) abundance in aquatic environments, their effects on phytoplankton have aroused large research attention. In this study, 100 nm sized polystyrene NPs were chosen to investigate their effecting performance and mechanisms on a typical dinoflagellates Alexandrium tamarense. The results indicated the population growth and photosynthetic efficiencies of A. tamarense were significantly inhibited by NPs exposure, as well as the increase in cellular total carotenoids and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). Meanwhile, the cellar ROS levels increased, corresponding to the increased activities or contents of multiple antioxidant components, including SOD, CAT, GPX, GR, GSH and GSSG. The transcriptional results support the physiological–biochemical results and further revealed the down-regulation of genes encoding the light reaction centers (PSI and PSII) and up-regulation of genes encoding the antioxidant components. Up-regulation of genes encoding key enzymes of the Calvin cycle and glycolytic pathway together with the TCA cycle could accelerate organic carbon and ATP production for A. tamarense cells resistant to NPs stress. Finally, more Glu and acetyl-CoA produced by the enhanced GSH cycle and the glycolytic pathway, respectively, accompanied by the up-regulation of Glu and Arg biosynthesis genes supported the increase in the PST contents under NPs exposure. This study established a data set involving physiological–biochemical changes and gene information about marine dinoflagellates responding to NPs, providing a data basis for further evaluating the ecological risk of NPs in marine environments.","Li L., Liu Q., Li B., Zhao Y.",10.3390/ijms25137297,International Journal Of Molecular Sciences
Her2 Mutation As An Emerging Target In Advanced Breast Cancer,"HER2 activating mutations have emerged as oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets in a variety of human tumors. In breast cancer, these deregulations occur at low frequency, and are mostly detected in HER2-nonamplified, metastatic disease. Preclinical evidence has clarified the role of hotspot mutations in HER2 constitutive activation, defining them as an alternative mechanism to HER2 gene amplification. Furthermore, recent clinical studies have indicated the emergence of newly acquired HER2 deregulations in significant proportions of breast cancer patients who experience disease progression following both endocrine and HER2-targeted therapies. As the involvement of HER2 mutation in therapy resistance may profoundly impact patient outcomes on successive therapies, several clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of various HER2-targeted drugs in HER2-mutant breast cancer. In this review, we firstly summarize the structural organization of the HER2 oncogene and its historical impact on breast cancer prognosis and therapeutic advancement. Then, we provide an overview of the frequencies and functional relevance of clinically recurrent HER2 mutations in breast cancer with a special focus on their role in therapeutic resistance.

Mir-524-5P Reduces The Progression Of The Braf Inhibitor-Resistant Melanoma,"BRAF inhibitors were approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, most patients acquire the resistance to BRAF inhibitors after several months of treatment. miR-524-5p is considered as a tumor suppressor in many cancers, including melanoma. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of miR-524-5p in melanoma with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor and evaluated the endogenous miR-524-5p expression as a biomarker for melanoma. The results showed that the expression of miR-524-5p was 0.481-fold lower in melanoma tissues (n = 117) than in nevus tissues (n = 40). Overexpression of miR-524-5p significantly reduced proliferative, anchorage-independent growth, migratory and invasive abilities of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells. Moreover, the introduction of miR-524-5p led to a reduced development of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma in vivo. Remarkably, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway was decreased after treatment with miR-524-5p. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing analysis implied that the complement system, leukocyte extravasation, liver X receptor/retinoid-X-receptor activation, and cAMP-mediated signaling may be related to miR-524-5p-induced pathways in the resistant cells. The miR-524-5p level was higher on average in complete response and long-term partial response patients than in progressive disease and short-term partial response patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Our results proposed that miR-524-5p could be considered as a target for treatment BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma and a prognostic marker in the response of patients to BRAF inhibitors for melanoma.","Nguyen M.-H.T., Lin C.-H., Liu S.-M., Miyashita A., Ihn H., Lin H., Ng C.H., Tsai J.-C., Chen M.-H., Tsai M.-S., Lin I.-Y., Liu S.-C., Li L.-Y., Fukushima S., Lu J., Ma N.",10.1016/j.neo.2020.10.009,Neoplasia (United States)
Interactive Effects Of Polystyrene Microplastics And Pb On Growth And Phytochemicals In Mung Bean (Vigna Radiata L.),"Interaction of different pollutants can aggravate hazards to biotic components in agroecosystems. Microplastics (MPs) are especially needed to be focused on because of their increasing use in life around the globe. We investigated the interactive impacts of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MP) and lead (Pb) on mung bean (Vigna radiata L.). Toxicity of MPs and Pb directly impeded V. radiata attributes. In combination i.e., M2P2 (40 µM Pb + 4.0 mg L-1 MPs) predominantly reduced the shoot root fresh and dry weights. \ Pb and PS-MP impaired the Rubisco activity and chlorophyll contents. The dose dependent relationship (M2P2) discomposed indole 3-acetic acid by 59.02%. Individual treatments P2 (40 µM Pb) and M2 (4.0 mg L(-1) MPs) respectively instigated a decline (44.07% and 27.12%) in IBA, while ABA was elevated. M2 significantly enhanced the contents of Alanine (Ala), Arginine (Arg), Proline (Pro), and glycine (Gly) by 64.11%, 63%, and 54% compared to control. Lysine (Lys) and Valine (Val) presented a converse relationship with other amino acids. Except for control, a gradual decline in yield parameters were observed in individual and combined applications of PS-MP. Proximate composition of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins also reflected a clear decrease in these compounds after combined application of Pb and MPs. Although, individual doses caused a decline in these compounds but effect of combined doses Pb and PS-MP was highly significant. Our results demonstrated the toxicity effect of Pb and MP in V. radiata attributes that is mainly linked with cumulative physiological and metabolic perturbations.

Characterization Of The Stem Cell Landscape And Identification Of A Stemness-Associated Prognostic Signature In Bladder Cancer,"It is accepted that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key to the occurrence, progression, drug resistance, and recurrence of bladder cancer (BLCA). Here, we aimed to characterize the landscapes of CSCs and investigate the biological and clinical signatures based on a prognostic model constructed by genes associated with CSCs. The malignant epithelial cells were discovered and sorted into six clusters through single cell analysis. C2 was identified as the CSCs. The signaling involved in the interactions between C2, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune cells mainly consisted of MK, THBS, ANGPTL, VISFATIN, JAM, and ncWNT pathways. The CSC-like prognostic index (CSCLPI) constructed by the random survival forest was a reliable risk factor for BLCA and had a stable and powerful effect on predicting the overall survival of patients with BLCA. The level of CAFs was higher among patients with higher CSCLPI scores, suggesting that CAFs play a significant role in regulating biological characteristics. The CSCLPI-developed survival prediction nomogram has the potential to be applied clinically to predict the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival of patients with BLCA. The CSCLPI can be used for prognostic prediction and drug treatment evaluation in the clinic.","Lin G., Lin J., Wang H., Wang L., Zhan F., Wu L., Xue L., Dong Y., Wei W., Liu L.",10.1186/s12935-024-03465-4,Cancer Cell International
The Prb/Rbl2-E2F1/4-Gcn5 Axis Regulates Cancer Stem Cell Formation And G0 Phase Entry/Exit By Paracrine Mechanisms,"The lethality, chemoresistance and metastatic characteristics of cancers are associated with phenotypically plastic cancer stem cells (CSCs). How the non-cell autonomous signalling pathways and cell-autonomous transcriptional machinery orchestrate the stem cell-like characteristics of CSCs is still poorly understood. Here we use a quantitative proteomic approach for identifying secreted proteins of CSCs in pancreatic cancer. We uncover that the cell-autonomous E2F1/4-pRb/RBL2 axis balances non-cell-autonomous signalling in healthy ductal cells but becomes deregulated upon KRAS mutation. E2F1 and E2F4 induce whereas pRb/RBL2 reduce WNT ligand expression (e.g. WNT7A, WNT7B, WNT10A, WNT4) thereby regulating self-renewal, chemoresistance and invasiveness of CSCs in both PDAC and breast cancer, and fibroblast proliferation. Screening for epigenetic enzymes identifies GCN5 as a regulator of CSCs that deposits H3K9ac onto WNT promoters and enhancers. Collectively, paracrine signalling pathways are controlled by the E2F-GCN5-RB axis in diverse cancers and this could be a therapeutic target for eliminating CSCs.","Chang C.-H., Liu F., Militi S., Hester S., Nibhani R., Deng S., Dunford J., Rendek A., Soonawalla Z., Fischer R., Oppermann U., Pauklin S.",10.1038/s41467-024-47680-z,Nature Communications
Fgfr Inhibition Overcomes Resistance To Egfr-Targeted Therapy In Epithelial-Like Cutaneous Carcinoma,"Purpose:Recurrent and/or metastatic unresectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) are treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but have poor clinical responses. A limited response (up to 45% of cases) to EGFR-targeted therapies was observed in clinical trials with patients with advanced and metastatic cSCC. Here, we analyze the molecular traits underlying the response to EGFR inhibitors, and the mechanisms responsible for cSCC resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. Experimental Design: We generated primary cell cultures and patient cSCC-derived xenografts (cSCC-PDXs) that recapitulate the histopathologic and molecular features of patient tumors. Response to geﬁtinib treatment was tested and geﬁtinib-resistant (GefR) cSCC-PDXs were developed. RNA sequence analysis was performed in matched untreated and GefR cSCC-PDXs to determine the mechanisms driving geﬁtinib resistance. Results: cSCCs conserving epithelial traits exhibited strong activation of EGFR signaling, which promoted tumor cell proliferation, in contrast to mesenchymal-like cSCCs. Geﬁtinib treatment strongly blocked epithelial-like cSCC-PDX growth in the absence of EGFR and RAS mutations, whereas tumors carrying the E545K PIK3CAactivating mutation were resistant to treatment. A subset of initially responding tumors acquired resistance after long-term treatment, which was induced by the bypass from EGFR to FGFR signaling to allow tumor cell proliferation and survival upon geﬁtinib treatment. Pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR signaling overcame resistance to EGFR inhibitor, even in PIK3CA-mutated tumors. Conclusions: EGFR-targeted therapy may be appropriate for treating many epithelial-like cSCCs without PIK3CA-activating mutations. Combined EGFR- and FGFR-targeted therapy may be used to treat cSCCs that show intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.","Bernat-Peguera A., Navarro-Ventura J., Lorenzo-Sanz L., Da Silva-Diz V., Bosio M., Palomero L., Penin R.M., Sidelnikova D.P., Bermejo J.O., Taberna M., Vilariño N., Piulats J.M., Mesia R., Viñals J.M., Gonzalez-Suarez E., Capella-Gutierrez S., Villanueva A., Viñals F., Muñoz P.",10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-0232,Clinical Cancer Research
"Ev-T Synergizes With Azd5582 To Overcome Trail Resistance Through Concomitant Suppression Of Cflip, Mcl-1, And Iaps In Hepatocarcinoma","Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy, and its effective treatment has been hampered by drug resistance. Extracellular vesicle (EV) delivery of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (EV-T) was demonstrated to be superior to recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) for cancer treatment previously. And AZD5582, a potent antagonist of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can potentiate apoptosis-based cancer therapies. However, the combination of EV-T and AZD5582 has never been examined for their possible apoptosis inducing synergism in cancers. In this study, we proposed and tested the combination of EV-T and AZD5582 as a potential novel therapy for effective treatment of HCC. Two HCC lines Huh7 and HepG2 that are both resistant to rTRAIL were examined. The results confirmed that AZD5582 and EV-T are synergistic for apoptosis induction in some cancer lines including Huh7 and HepG2 while sparing normal cells. More importantly, this study revealed that TRAIL sensitization by AZD5582 is mediated through the concomitant suppression of anti-apoptotic factors including cFLIP, MCL-1, and IAPs (XIAP, Survivin and cIAP-1). Particularly the downregulation of cFLIP and IAP's appeared to be essential and necessary for the synergism between AZD5582 and TRAIL. In vivo, we first time demonstrated that the combined therapy with low doses of AZD5582 and EV-Ts triggered drastically enhanced apoptosis leading to the complete eradication of Huh7 tumor development without any apparent adverse side effects examined. We thus have unraveled the important molecular mechanism underlying TRAIL sensitization by AZD5582, rationalizing the next development of a combination therapy with AZD5582 and EV-T for HCC treatment. Key messages: It confirmed the TRAIL sensitization by AZD5582, a potent antagonist of IAPs in hepatocarcinoma.It revealed that the sensitization is via the concomitant suppression of antiapoptotic factors including cFLIP, MCL-1, and IAPs.The downregulation of cFLIP and IAPs like Survivin appeared to be essential and necessary for the synergism between AZD5582 and nanosomal TRAIL.In vivo the combined therapy with AZD5582 and nanosomal TRAIL led to complete eradication of hepatocarcinoma tumors.This study has rationalized the next development of a combination therapy with AZD5582 and nanosomal TRAIL for cancer treatment.","Su K., Yuan Q., Hou H., Ke C., Huang C., Li S., Sun J., Yuan X., Lin Y., Chen Y., Xin H., Liang X., Du Z., Yuan Z.",10.1007/s00109-022-02180-9,Journal Of Molecular Medicine
In-Depth Characterization Of A New Patient-Derived Xenograft Model For Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma To Identify Viable Biologic Targets And Patterns Of Matrix Evolution Within Rare Tumor Types,"Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare breast cancer subtype with rapid growth, high rates of metastasis, recurrence and drug resistance, and diverse molecular and histological heterogeneity. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) provide a translational tool and physiologically relevant system to evaluate tumor biology of rare subtypes. Here, we provide an in-depth comprehensive characterization of a new PDX model for MBC, TU-BcX-4IC. TU-BcX-4IC is a clinically aggressive tumor exhibiting rapid growth in vivo, spontaneous metastases, and elevated levels of cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cell DNA. Relative chemosensitivity of primary cells derived from TU-BcX-4IC was performed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) oncology drug set, crystal violet staining, and cytotoxic live/dead immunofluorescence stains in adherent and organoid culture conditions. We employed novel spheroid/organoid incubation methods (Pu·MA system) to demonstrate that TU-BcX-4IC is resistant to paclitaxel. An innovative physiologically relevant system using human adipose tissue was used to evaluate presence of cancer stem cell-like populations ex vivo. Tissue decellularization, cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy imaging and rheometry revealed consistent matrix architecture and stiffness were consistent despite serial transplantation. Matrix-associated gene pathways were essentially unchanged with serial passages, as determined by qPCR and RNA sequencing, suggesting utility of decellularized PDXs for in vitro screens. We determined type V collagen to be present throughout all serial passage of TU-BcX-4IC tumor, suggesting it is required for tumor maintenance and is a potential viable target for MBC. In this study we introduce an innovative and translational model system to study cell–matrix interactions in rare cancer types using higher passage PDX tissue.","Matossian M.D., Chang T., Wright M.K., Burks H.E., Elliott S., Sabol R.A., Wathieu H., Windsor G.O., Alzoubi M.S., King C.T., Bursavich J.B., Ham A.M., Savoie J.J., Nguyen K., Baddoo M., Flemington E., Sirenko O., Cromwell E.F., Hebert K.L., Lau F., Izadpanah R., Brown H., Sinha S., Zabaleta J., Riker A.I., Moroz K., Miele L., Zea A.H., Ochoa A., Bunnell B.A., Collins-Burow B.M., Martin E.C., Burow M.E.",10.1007/s12094-021-02677-8,Clinical And Translational Oncology
Eml4-Alk Fusions Drive Lung Adeno-To-Squamous Transition Through Jak-Stat Activation,"Human lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma (LUAS), containing both adenomatous and squamous pathologies, exhibits strong cancer plasticity. We find that ALK rearrangement is detectable in 5.1–7.5% of human LUAS, and transgenic expression of EML4-ALK drives lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) formation initially and squamous transition at late stage. We identify club cells as the main cell-of-origin for squamous transition. Through recapitulating lineage transition in organoid system, we identify JAK-STAT signaling, activated by EML4-ALK phase separation, significantly promotes squamous transition. Integrative study with scRNA-seq and immunostaining identify a plastic cell subpopulation in ALK-rearranged human LUAD showing squamous biomarker expression. Moreover, those relapsed ALK-rearranged LUAD show notable upregulation of squamous biomarkers. Consistently, mouse squamous tumors or LUAD with squamous signature display certain resistance to ALK inhibitor, which can be overcome by combined JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment. This study uncovers strong plasticity of ALK-rearranged tumors in orchestrating phenotypic transition and drug resistance and proposes a potentially effective therapeutic strategy.","Qin Z., Yue M., Tang S., Wu F., Sun H., Li Y., Zhang Y., Izumi H., Huang H., Wang W., Xue Y., Tong X., Mori S., Taki T., Goto K., Jin Y., Li F., Li F.-M., Gao Y., Fang Z., Fang Y., Hu L., Yan X., Xu G., Chen H., Kobayashi S.S., Ventura A., Wong K.-K., Zhu X., Chen L., Ren S., Chen L.-N., Ji H.",10.1084/jem.20232028,Journal Of Experimental Medicine
First Report Of Fusarium Culmorum (W.G. Sm.) Sacc Causing Crown Rot On Wheat In Jordan,"Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a disease caused by numerous Fusarium species, primarily F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc., F. pseudograminearum (O'Donnell & T. Aoki), and F. graminearum Schwabe (Paulitz et al., 200). FCR on wheat is a worldwide distributed disease that causes significant yield losses. In the Middle East, FCR was reported in Iraq (Motallebi et al., 2015; Matny et al., 2019) and Syria (Motallebi et al., 2015). In Jordan, Fusarium occurrence on wheat was documented in a checklist publication in 1984 (Mamluk et al., 1984) without further identification of the causative species and its pathogenicity level. There have been no other reports of Fusarium on wheat in Jordan since then. Symptoms of Fusarium crown rot were observed in 2016-2022 (Alananbeh et al., 2018) across Jordan through annual surveys of wheat diseases. The disease severity was higher in the dry seasons such as that of 2017 and 2021. Very severe symptoms were noted on wheat planted at the University of Jordan experimental wheat plots (n=4) in 2016-2022. A total of 40 symptomatic plants were randomly collected from these plots. Roots and stems of the 40 plants were then cut into small sections, disinfected in 0.5% hypochlorite for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for one minute, and finally rinsed in sterile distilled water three times. The sections were dried under the laminar flow, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated for 10 -14 days at 25 ℃. The fungal cultures were purified by hyphal tipping. At least one pure isolate exhibited a typical morphology of F. culmorum was recovered from each plant. The colonies of pure cultures grew rapidly on PDA with fluffy floccose aerial mycelium and dark red to reddish brown pigment diffused in the agar. The isolates produced monophialidic conidiogenous cells. The formed marcoconidia were slightly curved, with pointed apical and foot cells, 3-5 septated, on average 28.5 - 46.5 X 4.5-7.0 μm, indication the cultures as Fusarium spp. (Figure 1). Chlamydospores were intercalary in hyphae and microconidia were absent. Two representative isolates (Iso-1 and Iso-2) identified putatively as F. culmorum, based on their morphological features, were sent to Macrogen Inc., South Korea to Sanger sequence a portion of the translation elongation factor 1-α gene using the EF1/EF2 primers (Geiser et al. 2004). Raw sequences were used to create consensus sequences using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor. The consensus sequences for the two representatives isolates were used to conduct BLASTn queries of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) which revealed they are 99.67% and 100% identical to MW233082.1, a TEF11-α sequence of the ex-epitype of F. culmorum (NRRL 25475, Crous et al. 2021). The two sequences generated herein were accessioned in GenBank (accession numbers: OQ785278 and OQ785279). Combined with the morphological and molecular analysis, the Iso-1 and Iso-2 were identified as Fusarium culmorum. The pathogenicity of the isolates was tested on two wheat cultivars using two methods: in vitro on seeds grown in sterile dishes and on seedlings. A 4 X 104 macroconidia suspension was prepared from 10 day-old culture of the isolate grown on PDA at 28 ºC. Seeds of two wheat cultivars, Hourani and Norsi were surface sterilized in 1% (v/v) bleach and rinsed in sterile distilled water three times. For the first method, seeds were soaked in the F. culmorum conidia suspension for 15 min and then dried using filter paper. The seeds were plated onto sterile paper towels in sterile plastic boxes and placed in a growth chamber. Three replicates with 10 seeds/replicate were used. Control Mock treatments used seeds treated with sterile distilled water. The germination percentage, coleoptile length, radicle length, longest seminal root length, and number of seminal roots were measured after 5 days. For the seedling-based pathogenicity test, seeds were planted in seedlings trays filled with sterilized 1:1:1 peat moss: sand: soil. 5 mL conidia suspension was drenched following seedling emergence. Ten replicates with one seed/replicate were used. Plants were watered when necessary to maintain appropriate soil growth conditions. The control seedlings were drenched with sterile distilled water. Disease symptoms were rated by the disease severity index (CRI) described by Mitter et al. (2006) after 35 days of inoculation. The in vitro test showed a reduction of germination and other seeds measurements in the presence of F. culmorum as compared to the control (Table 1 and Table 2, Figure 2). Similarly, the seedling's height, length of discoloration, disease score, disease severity index and germination percentage were all reduced in F. culmorum treated seedlings compared to the control. The two experiments showed that Cv. Norsi was more susceptible to FCR than Hourani (Table 1, Figure 2). F. culmorum was re-isolated from the roots of inoculated plants of both cultivars. The present study is the first report of the crown rot pathogen, F. culmorum on Jordanian wheat. Fusarium culmorum can cause significant economic losses and current research is ongoing to survey FCR-associated Fusarium spp. in Jordan, their genetic diversity, and QTL mapping for resistance genes in wheat landraces.","Alananbeh K., Al-Abdallat A., Al-Hiary H.",10.1094/PDIS-08-23-1714-PDN,Plant Disease
Chondrocyte Phenotype Is Sensitive To Hydrogel Composition In Engineered Growth Plate Microtissues,"INTRODUCTION: In this work, we evaluate hydrogel formulations in development of a regenerative therapy for growth plate (physis) injury. The growth plate is a soft cartilaginous tissue that is solely responsible for appendicular skeletal growth in children[l]. Trauma, osteosarcoma, radiation, and infection are main causes of growth plate injuries[2, 3]. The incidence of growth plate fractures is 2.4 to 4.6 per 1,000 in the pediatric population and up to 75% causes some form of growth disturbance[4-9]. Cancer-related injury is less common, but the morbidity is even greater. 75% of pediatric osteosarcoma form near the growth plate and 20% of those will necessitate limb amputation [10]. Complex reconstructive techniques are employed to preserve limb function. Children with physeal growth disruption can suffer deformity, limb loss, functional impairment, prolonged immobilization, multiple corrective surgeries, and physical and emotional pain during treatment. Lifelong morbidity and high cost make physeal regeneration an important goal for orthopaedic medicine. No experimental regenerative approach has succeeded in restoring physeal growth. A successful regenerative therapy must guide formation of the unique cellular architecture that is responsible for growth. The growth plate cartilage exhibits a stratified architecture with chondrocytes in zones of distinct differentiation states (e.g. resting, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic). Physeal chondrocytes depend on intercellular signaling across these zones to progress through their differentiation states and drive growth. To regenerate the growth plate, biomaterials are needed that support the several physeal chondrocyte states and that promote proper interzonal signaling. We have developed a novel model to test injectable and photopatternable hydrogel formulations for physeal regeneration. We assemble growth plate micro-tissues using distinct populations of embryonic chick sternal chondrocytes that have similar phenotypes to the zonal chondrocyte populations. Here we evaluated the effects of two hydrogel formulations, methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and a composite (PGH) of GelMA with methacrylated poly( ethylene glycol)(PEG) and methacrylated heparin, on micro-tissue growth in-vitro and in-vivo. The PEG in PGH provides resistance to cell mediated contraction and maintains chondrocyte phenotype. The gelatin promotes cell proliferation and re-orientation as an analogue of collagen. The heparin improves growth factor retention as an analogue of the heparan sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). METHODS: Polymer precursors (bovine type B gelatin, MW=40,000-50,000; PEG, MW=3500-4500; intestinal mucosa sodium heparin, MW=15,000) were methacrylated, purified, and characterized in-house. The hydrogels were prepared by dissolving polymers in HBSS, adding 0.005% w/v initiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl phosphinate, and photopolymerizing with 2.5 J/cm2/mm UV-A. The chick sternal chondrocytes were isolated from day 17 chick embryos with dissection of the sternae into 4 separate regions followed by collagenase digestion. Proliferative cells were isolated from the caudal tip, hypertrophic cells from the cranial end, and prehypertrophic cells near the caudal end. We assembled these populations in 3 distinct layers (zones) of equal thickness in cylindrical hydrogel constructs (10% w/v, 5 mm diameter x 3 mm thickness, 30million/mL) using layered photo-assembly with the prehypertrophic layer sandwiched between the proliferative, and hypertrophic layers. Nineteen in-vivo constructs were implanted in separate dorsal subcutaneous pockets of 8 week old male mice. In-vitro constructs were cultured in aMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, and 8 weeks and the implants were removed for histology (e.g. GAG staining) and immunohistochemistry evaluation (e.g. collagen type II and X). Significant differences between groups are determined by student t-test. RESULTS: The isolated sternal chondrocyte populations differed in phenotype as evidence by immunohistochemical staining of sterna for collagen type II versus. X and in production of the key physeal morphogens PTHrP and IHH (Fig. 1). Unlike the in vivo constructs, the in vitro cultured constructs failed to secrete significant GAG matrix. In the in vivo constructs, the amount and pattern of GAG synthesis was dependent on scaffold material. The PGH hydrogel supported more GAG production than the GelMA hydrogel, and this effect was most apparent in the hypertrophic layer at 3 weeks (Fig.2A B). Unlike the PGH constructs (Fig.3C), the GelMA constructs showed a non-uniform GAG stain with the intensity lessening away from the proliferative layer and near the cylinder wall (Fig. 3D). GelMA promoted hypertrophy of the chondrocytes as indicated by immunostaining of collagen type X. At 8 weeks, the hypertrophic zone of GelMA construct underwent mineralization. Cell stacking was observed, but not longitudinally oriented along the cylinder axis. DISCUSSION: The addition of heparin to the hydrogel formulations augmented maintenance of chondrocytes in GAG producing state, while GelMA alone led to accelerated hypertrophy. The gradient of GAG staining in GelMA constructs may indicate that a diffusing biofactor from the proliferative layer impacts GAG production in the neighboring layers. The PGH scaffold may have greater retention of this factor due to heparin incorporation leading to a more uniform stain in the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic zones. These results show that selecting biomaterials, which support the physeal chondrocyte phenotypes and signaling across zones is essential to promote establishment of physeal structure (e.g. oriented columnar stacking). Future work will further probe the effects of hydrogel compositions on the phenotype of the different chondrocyte populations and on diffusion of biomolecules involved in physeal architecture maintenance. SIGNIFICANCE: Children are a noticeably underserved population in orthopaedic regenerative medicine. We have developed a novel model to study the formation of physeal architecture and to develop therapies for physeal injury and disease.","Chen J., Donius A.E., Taboas J.M.",10.1002/jor.23247,Journal Of Orthopaedic Research
Effective Paclitaxel: Β-Cyclodextrin-Based Formulation Boosts In Vitro Anti-Tumor Potential And Lowers Toxicity In Zebrafish,"Paclitaxel (PCTX) is one of the most prevalently used chemotherapeutic agents. However, its use is currently beset with a host of problems: solubility issue, microplastic leaching, and drug resistance. Since drug discovery is challenging, we decided to focus on repurposing the drug itself by remedying its drawbacks and making it more effective. In this study, we have harnessed the aqueous solubility of sugars, and the high affinity of cancer cells for them, to entrap the hydrophobic PCTX within the hydrophilic shell of the carbohydrate β-cyclodextrin. We have characterized this novel drug formulation by testing its various physical and chemical parameters. Importantly, in all our in vitro assays, the conjugate performed better than the drug alone. We find that the conjugate is internalized by the cancer cells (A549) via caveolin 1-mediated endocytosis. Thereafter, it triggers apoptosis by inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. Based on experiments on zebrafish larvae, the formulation displays lower toxicity compared to PCTX alone. Thus, our “Trojan Horse” approach, relying on minimal components and relatively faster formulation, enhances the anti-tumor potential of PCTX, while simultaneously making it more innocuous toward non-cancerous cells. The findings of this study have implications in the quest for the most cost-effective chemotherapeutic molecule.","Show S., Dutta D., Nongthomba U., Prasad M.A.J.",10.1093/toxres/tfae150,Toxicology Research
Comammox Nitrospira And Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaea Are Dominant Ammonia Oxidizers In Sediments Of An Acid Mine Lake Containing High Ammonium Concentrations,"Exploring nitrifiers in extreme environments is vital to expanding our understanding of nitrogen cycle and microbial diversity. This study presents that complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) Nitrospira, together with acidophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), dominate in the nitrifying guild in sediments of an acid mine lake (AML). The lake water was characterized by acidic pH below 5 with a high ammonium concentration of 175 mg-N/liter, which is rare on the earth. Nitrification was active in sediments with a maximum nitrate production potential of 70.5 μg-N/(g-dry weight [dw] day) for mixed sediments. Quantitative PCR assays determined that in AML sediments, comammox Nitrospira and AOA amoA genes had relative abundances of 52% and 41%, respectively, among the total amoA genes. Further assays with 16S rRNA and amoA gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomics confirmed their dominance and revealed that the comammox Nitrospira found in sediments belonged to comammox Nitrospira clade A.2. Metagenomic binning retrieved a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of the comammox Nitrospira from sediments (completeness = 96.76%), and phylogenomic analysis suggested that it was a novel comammox Nitrospira. Comparative genomic investigation revealed that this comammox Nitrospira contained diverse metal resistance genes and an acidophile-affiliated F-type ATPase. Moreover, it had a more diverse genomic characteristic on nitrogen metabolism than the AOA in sediments and canonical AOB did. The results suggest that comammox Nitrospira is a versatile nitrifier that can adapt to acidic environments even with high ammonium concentrations. IMPORTANCE Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was previously considered the sole dominant ammonia oxidizer in acidic environments. This study, however, found that complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) Nitrospira was also a dominant ammonia oxidizer in the sediments of an acidic mine lake, which had an acidic pH < 5 and a high ammonium concentration of 175 mg-N/liter. In combination with average nucleotide identity analysis, phylogenomic analysis suggested it is a novel strain of comammox Nitrospira. Moreover, the adaption of comammox Nitrospira to the acidic lake had been comprehensively investigated based on genome-centric metagenomic approaches. The outcomes of this study significantly expand our understanding of the diversity and adaptability of ammonia oxidizers in the acidic environments.","Li D., Ren Z., Zhou Y., Jiang L., Zheng M., Liu G.",10.1128/aem.00047-23,Applied And Environmental Microbiology
Znf397 Deficiency Triggers Tet2-Driven Lineage Plasticity And Ar-Targeted Therapy Resistance In Prostate Cancer,"Cancer cells exhibit phenotypical plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming that allows them to evade lineage-dependent targeted treatments by adopting lineage plasticity. The underlying mechanisms by which cancer cells exploit the epigenetic regulatory machin-ery to acquire lineage plasticity and therapy resistance remain poorly understood. We identified zinc finger protein 397 (ZNF397) as a bona fide coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR), essential for the transcriptional program governing AR-driven luminal lineage. ZNF397 deficiency facilitates the transition of cancer cell from an AR-driven luminal lineage to a ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2)-driven lineage plastic state, ultimately promoting resistance to therapies inhibiting AR signaling. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that a TET2 inhibitor can eliminate the resistance to AR-targeted therapies in ZNF397-deficient tumors. These insights uncover a novel mechanism through which prostate cancer acquires lineage plasticity via epigenetic rewiring and offer promising implications for clinical interventions designed to overcome therapy resistance dictated by lineage plasticity. Significance: This study reveals a bifurcated role of ZNF397, and a TET2–driven epigenetic mechanism regulating tumor lineage plasticity and therapy response in prostate cancer, enhances the understanding of drug resistance, and unveils a new therapeutic strategy for overcoming androgen receptor-targeted therapy resistance.","Xu Y., Yang Y., Wang Z., Sjöström M., Jiang Y., Tang Y., Cheng S., Deng S., Wang C., Gonzalez J., Johnson N.A., Li X., Li X., Metang L.A., Mukherji A., Xu Q., Tirado C.R., Wainwright G., Yu X., Barnes S., Hofstad M., Chen Y., Zhu H., Hanker A.B., Raj G.V., Zhu G., He H.H., Wang Z., Arteaga C.L., Liang H., Feng F.Y., Wang Y., Wang T., Mu P.",10.1158/2159-8290.CD-23-0539,Cancer Discovery
Press Perturbations Of Microplastics And Antibiotics On Freshwater Micro-Ecosystem: Case Study For The Ecological Restoration Of Submerged Plants,"Microplastics (MPs) can adsorb antibiotics to form complex pollutants, which seriously threatens the health of freshwater ecosystems. Few studies have examined the combined pollution characteristics of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics in restored freshwater ecosystems and their effects on the growth traits of the aquatic primary producers. We studied both the ecotoxicological effects of polyethylene (PE) MPs and the antibiotics sulfanilamide (sulfa, SA) on the structural (diversity etc.,) and functional (nutrient cycling etc.,) properties of water–plant–sediment ecosystems. The synergistic toxic effects of PE and SA resulted in a reduction in the chlorophyll content and chloroplast fluorescence. Meanwhile, PE and SA single/combined pollution stress inhibits the radial oxygen loss in roots, and activates the antioxidant defense system in leaves. The change in the growth response characteristics of Vallisneria natans (V. natans) under oxidative stress induced by single/combined pollution showed a dosage effect. The microbial compositions of the overlying water and sediment were significantly changed by the pollution exposure, as evidenced by the increased microbial diversity and altered microbial taxa distribution. An increase in the total concentrations of sulfa in the overlying water was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of resistance genes. PE-MPs significantly affected the removal of total nitrogen and antibiotics from the overlying water. The interaction between PE and SA affects ammonia and nitrite nitrogen exchange in water–sediment systems. Thus, this study investigated the effects of combined MP and antibiotics pollution on the growth state, metabolic function, microbial community structure and microbial diversity of the freshwater ecosystems. The mechanism underlying of the combined polyethylene-sulfanilamide (PE–SA) effect on the V. natans was revealed. In addition, the correlation between different environmental factors was analyzed, and a structural equation model was constructed. This study provides primary data for evaluating the ecological and environmental effects of combined PE–SA pollution and its possible risks. Moreover, it provides a reference index for the study of ecological wetland environments and phytoremediation.","Zhang S., Wang H., Liu M., Yu H., Peng J., Cao X., Wang C., Liu R., Kamali M., Qu J.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.119248,Water Research
"Under Flooding Conditions, Controlled-Release Fertiliser Coated Microplastics Affect The Growth And Accumulation Of Cadmium In Rice By Increasing The Fluidity Of Cadmium And Interfering With Metabolic Pathways","The combined pollution of microplastics (MPs) and Cd can affect plant growth and development and Cd accumulation, with most studies focusing on dryland soil. However, the effects of polyurethane (PU) controlled-release fertiliser coated MPs (PU MPs), which widely exist in rice systems, coupled with Cd on plant growth and Cd accumulation under flooding conditions are still unknown. Therefore, in the present study, in situ techniques were used to systematically study the effects of PU MPs and Cd coupling on the physiological and biochemical performance, metabolomics characteristics, rhizosphere bacterial community, and Cd bioavailability of rice in different soil types (red soil/cinnamon soil). The results showed that the effects of PU MPs on rice growth and Cd accumulation were concentration-dependent, especially in red soil. High PU concentration (1 %) inhibited rice root growth significantly (44 %). The addition of PU MPs inhibited photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthesis, and transpiration rate of rice, mainly with low concentration (0.1 %) in red soil and high concentration (1 %) in cinnamon soil. PU MPs can enhance the expression of Cd resistance genes (cadC and copA) in soil, enhance the mobility of Cd, and affect the metabolic pathways of metabolites in the rhizosphere soil (red soil: fatty acid metabolism; cinnamon soil: amino acid degradation, heterobiodegradation, and nucleotide metabolism) to promote Cd absorption in rice. Especially in red soil, Cd accumulation in the root and aboveground parts of rice after the addition of high concentration PU (1 %) was 1.7 times and 1.3 times, respectively, that of the control (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, microorganisms can affect rice growth and Cd bioavailability by affecting functional bacteria related to carbon, iron, sulfur, and manganese. The results of the present study provide novel insights into the potential effects of PU MPs coupled with Cd on plants, rhizosphere bacterial communities, and Cd bioavailability.","Zhao M., Li C., Zhang C., Zhao Y., Wang X., Cao B., Xu L., Zhang J., Wang J., Zuo Q., Chen Y., Zou G.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166434,Science Of The Total Environment
Guidelines For The Use And Interpretation Of Assays For Monitoring Autophagy (4Th Edition)(1),"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.","Klionsky D.J., Abdel-Aziz A.K., Abdelfatah S., Abdellatif M., Abdoli A., Abel S., Abeliovich H., Abildgaard
