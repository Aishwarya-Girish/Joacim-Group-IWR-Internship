Antimicrobial Efficacy Of A Silver Impregnated Hydrophilic Pu Foam,"A novel hydrophilic polyurethane (PU) foam dressing which is impregnated with silver chloride, Optifoam® Gentle (OG) Ag+ (Medline Industries Inc., Chicago, Illinois), was evaluated in this study. The aims of this study were to determine the rate of elution of silver from the foam dressing over a period of 168 hours into simulated wound fluid and an evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy using zone of inhibition (ZOI), direct kill, and time-kill viability. Thirty-two microorganisms associated with wounds including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida albicans, and antibiotic-resistant strains (Methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [VRE]) were evaluated. Silver release from the wound dressing showed an exponential curve with a stable sustained release of 25ppm achieved after 24 hours, which was maintained for the full duration of the study. OG Ag+ caused inhibition zones ranging from 4-16mm after a 24-hour contact time. In the direct kill assay, OG Ag+ reduced the microbial numbers below the limit of detection and reduced viability by a log of four within 24 hours. For the time-kill viability studies, the results support the use of this hydrophilic polyurethane foam as a wound dressing for use in wounds at risk of infection or infected by achieving a four log kill within six hours and a six log kill in 16 hours. In conclusion, OG Ag+ was shown to be an effective wound dressing in the killing of a range of important opportunistic pathogens of relevance to wound healing and infections. Achieving a six log kill against S. aureus and E.coli, within 16 hours in the time kill assay, (ASTM E2315-03) demonstrates that OG Ag+ should be an important addition to the armoury available for the management of acute and chronic wounds at risk of infection or clinically infected.",Steven L Percival,No DOI,Surgical Technology International

Topical Approaches To Improve Surgical Outcomes And Wound Healing: A Review Of Efficacy And Safety,"<p>Surgical procedures are an important piece of a dermatologist's daily practice. Therefore, the optimization of post-surgical wound healing is an area of utmost importance and interest. Although low risk, one notable barrier to proper wound healing is surgical site infection.</p> <p>In an attempt to mitigate this risk and improve surgical outcomes, multiple topical products continue to be used both pre- and postprocedure. Traditionally, this includes both topical antibiotics and antiseptics. However, these products are not without consequence.</p> <p>The overuse of topical antibiotics as prophylaxis for infection has contributed to increased bacterial resistance, and in fact is no longer recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology in clean post surgical wounds. Topical antiseptics, including chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine, can have a cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes and may actually impede wound healing as a result. In addition, chlorhexidine in particular can produce both otologic and ocular toxic effects when used on the face. Emerging products, such as hypochlorous acid, may be a potential alternative to the more commonly used agents, as it has effective antimicrobial actions and minimal adverse effects. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to highlight several topical products used to optimize post-surgical wound healing and discuss both their efficacy and safety.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(3):209-212.</em></p>.","Kristin Totoraitis, Joel L Cohen, Adam Friedman",No DOI,Journal Of Drugs In Dermatology : Jdd
[Ggi As A Gene Carrier Delivering Mdr1 Sirna To A549/Ddp Cells For Reversal Of Multidrug Resistance],"This study was designed to reverse multidrug resistance of lung cancer cells by downregulating MDR1 genes through RNA interference (RNAi) technology. A novel biodegradable cationic polymer (PEG- b- PLG-g-PEIs, GGI) was synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR. The particle size and zeta potential were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The cell viability profile of GGI was tested by MTT method with both A549 and A549/DDP cell lines. Flow cytometry (FCM) technology was used to investigate the efficiency and intensity of delivering siRNA to cells by GGI polymer. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and P-gp expression after GGI/MDR1 siRNA transfection assay. The sensitivity of cisplatin administration after transfecting GGI/MDR1 siRNA polyplexs was performed with MTT and Annexin V-FITC/PI methods. The results suggest that the particle size and zeta potential of GGI/siRNA were 150 −200 nm and 16−28 mV. GGI exhibited a lower cell cytotoxity than PEI 25K and higher efficiency of delivering siRNA, which dramatically decreased the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp of A549/DDP cells and increased much sensitivity to cisplatin in A549/DDP cells. GGI holds a great potential in gene delivery as a novel cationic polymer for further investigation.","Zi-Rui Wang, Feng Bai, Xiao-Ying Zhang, Jia-Min Wu, Ling Guo, Zhi Li, Min Feng",No DOI,Yao Xue Xue Bao = Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica
[Advances In The Treatment Of Wound Bacterial Infection With Phage],"The treatment of wound bacterial infection is an extremely difficult problem in clinic, especially in patients with large wounds which are infected by multidrug resistant, pan-resistant or omni-resistant bacteria. In recent years, with a grim prospect of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy is re-valued by researchers after being ignored for nearly half a century. Phage therapy has made great achievements in prevention and control of bacterial infection of open wounds.

[Cancer Phenotypic Plasticity And Therapeutic Resistance],"Cancer genomic medicine or cancer immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. When the first treatment does not work, patients may be able to have second-line therapy or additional rounds of treatment after that, however, most advanced cancers eventually acquire resistance to those treatments. To stop this perpetual cycle, a deeper understanding of cancer evolutionary trajectories during the acquisition of therapeutic resistance is needed. We and others have recently provided evidence that non-genetic drug resistance is due to dormant persister cells, yet little is known about how persister cancer cells promote tumor relapse. To study the non-genetic evolution of cancer cells, a single-cell analysis will enable us to trace the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells. As persister cancer cells are considered to act as a reservoir for drug-resistant mutants, we may be able to overcome cancer relapse or metastasis if we can better understand their evolutionary trajectories.",Kunihiko Hinohara,No DOI,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho.

Cancer: More Than A Geneticist'S Pandora'S Box,"Despite identical genetic constitution, a cancer cell population can exhibit phenotypic variations termed as nongenetic/ non-mutational heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity - a ubiquitous nature of biological systems - has been implicated in metastasis, therapy resistance and tumour relapse. Here, we review the evidence for existence, sources and implications of non-genetic heterogeneity in multiple cancer types. Stochasticity/noise in transcription, protein conformation and/or external microenvironment can underlie such heterogeneity. Moreover, the existence of multiple possible cell states (phenotypes) as a consequence of the emergent dynamics of gene regulatory networks may enable reversible cell-state transitions (phenotypic plasticity) that can facilitate adaptive drug resistance and higher metastatic fitness. Finally, we highlight how computational and mathematical models can drive a better understanding of non-genetic heterogeneity and how a systemslevel approach integrating mathematical modeling and in (vitro/in vivo) experiments can map the diverse phenotypic repertoire and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities of an otherwise clonal cell population.","Kritika Saxena, Ayalur Raghu Subbalakshmi, Prakash Kulkarni, Mohit Kumar Jolly",No DOI,Journal Of Biosciences
"[Genetics And Genomics Of Wheat: Storage Proteins, Ecological Plasticity, And Immunity]","Recent advances in genetics and genetic research methods made it possible to explain the large polymorphism observed among storage proteins of wheat weevil (gliadins and glutenins), to determine their genetic control mechanism, and to develop a system for the identification of wheat genotypes on the basis of multiple allelism. This system has extremely high sensitivity and efficiency, which makes it possible to conduct studies to determine the purity and authenticity of wheat varieties, the dynamics of alleles diversity in time and space, the phylogenetics, etc., through the use of an extensive database on the allelic composition of gliadin loci. An investigation of the molecular structure of genes controlling the synthesis of storage proteins and their organization on chromosomes, as well as an analysis of wheat genome structure, revealed the molecular mechanisms of variability in the wheat genome and its reorganization in response to changes in environmental conditions and cultivation technologies. The multilevel genetic system of protection against pathogens and adverse environmental factors that developed in the course of wheat evolution continues to astound researchers' imagination with new resistance genes and novel types of antimicrobial peptides having been discovered and sequenced in recent years and the diversity of their structures and mechanisms of action in response to pathogens. An analysis of gene sequences involved in wheat domestication, namely, those that define ecological plasticity, i. e. the type of plant development (Vrn genes), and those responsible for spikelet traits (Q genes), which ensured the successful cultivation of wheat by humans, revealed that the basis for these features are specific mutations.",A Yu Novoselskaya-Dragovich,No DOI,Genetika

Evaluation Of Antibiotic Use And Bacterial Profile In Burn Unit Patients At The Dr. Soetomo General Hospital,"The high inaccuracy of antibiotic prescribing in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya, Indonesia, is one of the factors triggering the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) showed that bacterial resistance to antibiotics was a threat to people's health around the world. Burn injuries are susceptible to infection and need appropriate antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to obtain a germ map for our burn patients and to evaluate the antibiotic therapy that had been used to treat them. This was a descriptive observational study, conducted in the Burn Unit at the Dr. Soetomo General Hospital. The study used data from burn patients who were treated there from February to May 2018. The patients' medical records, records of drug usage (antibiotics) and culture results data (bacterial sensitivity test for antibiotics) were examined. Total antibiotic usage was calculated using the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) method per 100 days. The quality of antibiotic usage was assessed using the Gyssens method. Bacterial profile was obtained from culture swab. According to our findings, the most widely used antibiotic is ceftazidim with DDD / 100 days of 22.25. Based on the qualitative analysis using the Gyssens method, 33.3% were in category VI-0. The most common bacteria obtained from the swabs were Bacillus cereus and Acinetobacter baumanni, found in 12% of the patients. Antibiotics are still not used wisely in the Burn Unit at the Dr. Soetomo General Hospital.","S Aisyah, R Yulia, I D Saputro, F Herawati",No DOI,Annals Of Burns And Fire Disasters
A Composite Hydrogel With Antibacterial And Promoted Cell Proliferation Dual Properties For Healing Of Infected Wounds,"Wound infection remains a major challenge for health professionals, because it delays wound healing and increases the overall cost and morbidity. Therefore, the development of new biomaterials with new antibacterial properties and healing effects remains a dire clinical need. To solve this problem, we developed silver nanoparticles embedded in γ-cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks (Ag@MOF) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-loaded hydrogel systems based on methacrylated silk fibroin (SFMA) and methacrylate hyaluronic acid (HAMA) as Ag+ ion and growth factor delivery vehicles for inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant bacteria and promoting wound healing. The prepared SFMA/HAMA hydrogel demonstrated good rheological properties, swelling capability, appropriate mechanical properties and controllable biodegradability. The SFMA/HAMA/Ag@MOF/PRP hydrogel showed sustained release profiles of Ag+ ions and EGF. The SFMA/HAMA/Ag@MOF hydrogel have good inherent antibacterial properties against both gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria. The prepared hydrogel showed excellent cytocompatibility and could stimulate the growth and proliferation rate of NIH-3T3 cells. In vivo experiments showed that SFMA/HAMA/Ag@MOF/PRP hydrogel treatment enhanced the healing of full-thickness wounds, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and promoted re-epithelialization and collagen synthesis. All results indicated that the prepared hydrogel has tremendous potential to reduce wound infections and improve wound healing.","Shikun Wei, Zhongshan Wang, Xiaoyan Liang, Tingliang Xiong, Zhengyang Kang, Sheng Lei, Bin Wu, Biao Cheng",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research

[Molecular Mechanisms Of Drug Resistance Neisseria Gonorrhoeae History And Prospects],"Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is a strict human pathogen, which causes gonorrhea--an infectious disease, whose origin dates back to more than two thousand years. Due to the unique plasticity of the genetic material, these bacteria have acquired the capacity to adapt to the host immune system, cause repeated infections, as well as withstand antimicrobials. Since the introduction of antibiotics in 1930s, gonococcus has displayed its propensity to develop resistance to all clinically useful antibiotics. It is important to note that the known resistance determinants of N. gonorrhoeae were acquired through horizontal gene transfer, recombination and spontaneous mutagenesis, and may be located both in the chromosome and on the plasmid. After introduction of a new antimicrobial drug, gonococcus becomes resistant within two decades and replaces sensitive bacterial population. Currently Ceftriaxone is the last remaining antibiotic for first-line treatment of gonorrhea. However, the first gonococcus displaying high-level resistance to Ceftriaxone was isolated in Japan a few years ago. Therefore, in the near future, gonorrhea may become untreatable. In the present review, we discuss the chronology of the anti-gonorrhea drugs (antibiotics) replacement, the evolution of resistance mechanisms emergence and future perspectives of N. gonorrhoeae treatment.","I N Bodoev, E N Il'Ina",No DOI,"Molekuliarnaia Genetika, Mikrobiologiia I Virusologiia"

Nitroglycerin Hypotensive Effect And Application In A Combined Surgery For Reconstruction After Ipsilateral Maxillectomy And Orbit Evisceration,"The oral and maxillofacial region is rich in blood, and it is often difficult to stop bleeding during the operation of maxilla. Nitroglycerin is one of the most commonly used antihypertensive drugs in our hospital. We observed the effect of controlled hypotension in patients with maxillary resection. In group N, the patients had different degrees of tachycardia after using nitroglycerin only. In addition, nitroglycerin has the characteristics of rapid drug resistance. A combined reversed temporal muscle flap and random forehead flap technique was performed successfully to reconstruct the large defect after ipsilateral maxillectomy and orbit evisceration. There were 43 cases used this method during 2014-2016 without large side effects.","Yuhang Sun, Xiaohui Dong, Guofeng Zhang, Jing An, Haojun Yuan",No DOI,Pakistan Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences
[Influence Of Poly-Β-1-6-N-Acetylglucosamine On Biofilm Formation And Drug Resistance Of Acinetobacter Baumannii],"Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the leading bacteria for nosocomial infections, especially in burn wards and ICUs. The bacteria can easily form biofilm and readily attach to abiotic and biotic surfaces, resulting in persistent biofilm-mediated infections. Being surrounded by self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), the microorganisms in biofilm can acquire protective property against detrimental environment and their tolerance toward antibiotics is increased. Poly-β-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), the common constituent of EPS in Acinetobacter baumannii, acts as the key virulence factor and plays a crucial role in biofilm formation process. This review describes the properties and functions of the PNAG and its influence on biofilm formation and drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii.","Haina Guo, Jun Xiang",No DOI,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns

"Study On Biofilm Formation In Burn Wound Infection In A Pediatric Hospital In Chennai, India","Infection is one of the major causes of death in pediatric burns in India. This work was conducted in an exclusive Children's Hospital (KKCTH) with a total of 220 beds, of which ten beds in the burn unit and two isolation beds in the 28-bed PICU are for burns patients (more than 20% TBSA burns) with sepsis. In this study, 30 burn wound swab isolates obtained from 14 pediatric burns patients (admitted to the burns ward and transferred to PICU) from November 2013 to March 2014 were investigated. Cultures were done on the first day for all patients and empirical antibiotic administration was started for those with septic burns (14 in total) with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. Antibiotics were changed according to antibiotic sensitivity reports. Cultures were repeated for culture positive cases on the fifth day. Further antibiotic treatment was based on this culture report. When the general condition of the patient did not respond to highlevel antibiotics, biofilm formation was suspected and evaluated as the possible cause of antibiotic resistance. For these patients, an enhanced method of wound debridement and albumin transfusions were used to improve their general condition. Microbial identification and antimicrobial sensitivity testing was done for all 30 isolates. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus aureus showed multidrug resistance. Biofilm formation was studied using the Tissue Culture Plate (TCP) method for all bacterial isolates, and results showed that most of the MDR isolates formed biofilm.","M Ramakrishnan, S Putli Bai, M Babu",No DOI,Annals Of Burns And Fire Disasters

We found that the taxol-resistant cells demonstrated higher basal levels of autophagy than parental cells, which could be inhibited by 3-MA and Beclin-1-siRNA. We further revealed that inhibition of autophagy enhanced taxol-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, resulted in partial reversal of the acquired taxol resistance in taxol-resistant cells. Our results suggest that the combination of an autophagy inhibitor with taxol may be a promising approach to promote therapeutic efficacy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Yexun Song, Wei Li, Xiaowei Peng, Jun Xie, Heqing Li, Guolin Tan",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
[Controlling Infection And Spread Of Carbapenems-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Among Burn Patients],"The emergence and spread of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn ward is an important threat to burn management. CRKP isolates are resistant to almost all available antibiotics and are susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline. The mechanism of the drug resistance of CRKP is associated with the plasmid-encoded carbapenemase Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), a carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamase. Antibiotics which can currently be used to treat CRKP infection include polymyxins, tigecycline, and some aminoglycosides. The efficacy of using antibiotics in combination is better than that of single-agent therapy for the treatment of CRKP infection in bloodstream. In order to control CRKP infection in burn patients, strategies for preventing CRKP dissemination in burn ward are strongly advocated.",Jingning Huan,No DOI,Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi = Zhonghua Shaoshang Zazhi = Chinese Journal Of Burns

Targeting Stat3 Restores Braf Inhibitor Sensitivity Through Mir-759-3P In Human Cutaneous Melanoma Cells,"Melanoma treatment with the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib provides therapeutic benefits, but the common emergence of drug resistance remains a challenge. To define molecular mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance, we generated A375-R, WM35-R cell lines resistant to vemurafenib and found that the p-STAT3 was upregulated in these cells in vitro and in vivo. In particular, activation of the STAT3 pathway was associated with vemurafenib resistance. Inhibition of this pathway with STAT3-specific siRNA (shRNA) sensitized A375-R, WM35-R cells to vemurafenib and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, targeting STAT3 induced expression of miR-579-3p and elicited resistance to vemurafenib. However, targeting miR-579-3p with anti- miR-579-3p reversed the resistance to vemurafenib. Together, these results indicate that STAT3-mediated downexpression of miR-579-3p caused resistance to vemurafenib. Our findings suggest novel approaches to overcome resistance to vemurafenib by combining vemurafenib with STAT3 silencing or miR-579-3p overexpression.","Yipeng Su, Ying Yu, Dongying He, Jinna Zhang, Zhiguo Wang, Pengfei Sun, Zhenyu Chen",No DOI,International Journal Of Clinical And Experimental Pathology
Bacterial And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Profile And The Prevalence Of Sepsis Among Burn Patients At The Burn Unit Of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,"Infection is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among burn patients. An effective measure to reduce infection is routine monitoring of bacterial infection and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at the burn unit. This will help to create a burn centre-specific empirical antibiotic therapy protocol. A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) Burn Unit between September-November 2016. Data regarding bacterial culture isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility spectrum, and the number of burn patients diagnosed with sepsis were collected. There were 36 patients with positive bacterial cultures, with the isolates changing continuously between Klebsiella pneumonia (17%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (12%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (11%). High resistance was found for 10 antimicrobials, particularly cephalosporins. The three bacteria were only sensitive to carbapenem, aminoglycosides and tigecycline. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with sepsis (38.9%), 10 died. Two major sepsis-causing bacteria were P. aeruginosa (33.3%) and K. pneumoniae (28.9%). Bacterial isolates in our setting changed every month. Almost all bacterial isolates are multi-drug resistant, highly resistant to the empirical therapy given (ceftriaxone), leading to outbreaks of sepsis and increased mortality rates. Carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem and doripenem) and aminoglycosides (amikacin) combination was the selected empirical therapy.","A Wardhana, R Djan, Z Halim",No DOI,Annals Of Burns And Fire Disasters

Surveillance Of Gram-Positive Cocci Infections And Drug Resistance,"In this study, the prevalence of gram-positive cocci isolates and the characteristics of multiple drug resistances in patients were investigated. Antibiotic resistances were determined in the clinical microbiology laboratory with the methodology of the CLSI (2012). The software WHONET5.4 and SPSS13.0 were used for statistical analysis. There were a total of 6211 gram-positive cocci isolates, comprised of 2255 (36.3%) coagulase (-) staphylococci, 1277 (20.6%) staphylococci aureus, 1109 (17.9%) enterococcus faecalis, and 1045 (16.8%) enterococcus faecium. The proportion of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 16.6% (212/1277). Methicillin resistant coagulase (-) staphylococci (MRCNS) was 14.1% (318/2255). There were no strains in isolated enterococci resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Among the majority of all monitored antibiotics, methicillin resistant staphylococci has much higher drug resistance rate than methicillin sensitive staphylococci (p<0.05). Enterococcus faecalis has higher multiple drug resistant rate than enterococcus faecium (p<0.01).

Environmental Factors Associated With Etiology Of Microbiologically Confirmed Reconstructive Breast Implant Infections: Impact On Clinical Management And Treatment,"Even if wide differences exist in the incidence of Gram-negative infections following breast cancer implant reconstructions (2-20%), its occurrence needs to be considered to optimize antibiotic therapy, which is usually directed towards Gram-positive cocci. There is a general notion on the possible source of Gram-negative microorganisms during outdoor activities. For this reason, we administered a specific questionnaire to infected patients to investigate this aspect. In 450 consecutive implant reconstructions between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018, 27 patients (6%) developed proven infection. For each patient, we collected age, tumor stage and recurrence, chemo/radiotherapy, infecting microorganism, fate of implant, type and duration of antibiotic treatment, and administered a questionnaire on exposure to contaminated environments. Twenty patients (74%) had Gram-positive and 7 (26%) had implants infected by Gram-negative agents. The two groups were homogeneous as regards age and no statistically significant difference was observed for other parameters. A significant difference was detected with regard to environmental risk factors in the Gram-negative group (p=0,049). Length of antibiotic therapy was longer in the Gram-negative patients (17.4 vs 11.05 days) and antibiotic treatment was ineffective in 43% of the Gram-negative group. Environmental factors may be an element to evaluate in order to improve patient management. Surveys on larger cohorts are warranted.","Simonetta Franchelli, Alessandro Rossin, Marianna Pesce, Anna Marchese, Andrea De Maria",No DOI,The New Microbiologica

Responses Of Bacterial Communities And Resistance Genes On Microplastics To Antibiotics And Heavy Metals In Sewage Environment,"In present study, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), tetracycline (TC) and ampicillin (AMP) were selected to study the in-dividual and synergistic effects of antibiotics and heavy metals on the microbial communities and resistance genes on polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC MPs) and surrounding sewage after 28 and 84 days. The results indicated that PVC MPs enriched many microorganisms from surrounding sewage, especially pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium and Aquabacterium. The resistance gene with the highest abundance enriched on PVC MPs was tnpA (average abundance of 1.0 x 107 copies/mL sewage). The single presence of Zn, TC and AMP inhibited these enrichments for a short period of time (28 days). But the single presence of Cu and the co-existence of antibiotics and heavy metals inhibited these enrichments for a long period of time (84 days), resulting in relatively low microbial diversities and resistance genes abundances. Transpose tnpA had significantly positive correlations (p < 0.05) with all other genes. Pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium and Legionella were potential hosts harboring 5 and 1 resistance genes, respectively. Overall, PVC MPs played important roles in the distribution and transfer of pathogenic bacteria and resistance genes in sewage with the presence of antibiotics or (and) heavy metals.","Zhao, Yf; Gao, Jf; Wang, Zq; Dai, Hh; Wang, Yw",No DOI,Journal Of Hazardous Materials
Evaluation Of Sources Of Resistance To Meloidogyne Enterolobii In Solanum Stramonifolium And S. Scuticum As Potential Rootstocks For Cultivated Solanaceae,"Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are responsible for economic losses in various crops across the world. Meloidogyne enterolobii was first found in Brazil on guava in 2001 and spread rapidly, causing loses in many other plant species as well as vegetables such as tomatoes, Capsicum species, lettuce, and sweet potato. Meloidogyne enterolobii is also known to affect plant hybrids that contain resistance genes to other major Meloidogyne species. The objective of this research was to identify sources of resistance to M. enterolobii in Solanum stramonifolium and S. scuticum with the potential to be used as rootstocks for cultivated crops in the Solanaceae family. Twenty-nine accessions of S. scuticum and seven of S. stramonifolium were evaluated. Tomato cultivars 'Rutgers' and 'Nemadoro' (standard for M. javanica, M. incognita, and M. arenaria) were used as susceptible and resistant controls, respectively. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in a completely randomized design with six replications. Plants were grown in plastic pots containing 1.5 L of substrate and then inoculated with 5,000 eggs and second-stage juveniles of M. enterolobii. After 74 days incubation, gall index (GI), egg mass index (EMI), number of eggs per gram of root (NOGR), and reproduction factor (RF) were determined. Solanum stramonifolium was the best source of resistance to M. enterolobii, with the accessions CNPH 349 and CNPH 24 being highly resistant. Solanum scuticum had a lower frequency of resistance compared with S. stramonifolium. However, it was possible to identify some S. scuticum accessions, CNPH 07, CNPH 39, and CNPH 9, that were resistant to M. enterolobii.","Pinheiro, Jb; Da Silva, Go; Macedo, Ag; Biscaia, D; Melo, Rade",No DOI,Nematropica
First Report Of Meloidogyne Enterolobii In Capsicum Rootstocks Carrying The Me1 And Me3/Me7 Genes In Central Brazil,"Meloidogyne enterolobii (= M. mayaguensis) has been reported as a potential threat to tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and pepper (Capsicum spp.) crops in tropical and subtropical areas. Of particular concern with this nematode is its ability to overcome the resistance mediated by the tomato Mi-1 gene as well as by some of the Me genes in Capsicum. In the present work, we report for the first time the occurence of M. enterolobii infecting Capsicum annuum plants carrying the Me1 and Me3/Me7 genes under plastic house systems in Brasilia-DF (Central Brazil). Plants of the commercial rootstock hybrid 'Snooker' (a pyramid of the genes Me1 and Me3/ Me7) infected by M. enterolobii (esterase phynotype M2) exhibited overall yellowing, severe wilt symptoms, premature defoliation, and root rot accompanied by profuse root galling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. enterolobii infection in root-knot resistant Capsicum rootstocks in Central Brazil, thus expanding the geographical distribution of this pathogen in this host species.","Pinheiro, Jb; Boiteux, Ls; Almeida, Mra; Pereira, Rb; Galhardo, Lcs; Carneiro, Rmdg",No DOI,Nematropica
Oncogene- And Drug Resistance-Associated Alternative Exon Usage In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Aml),"In addition to spliceosome gene mutations, oncogene expression and drug resistance in AML might influence exon expression. We performed exon-array analysis and exon-specific PCR (ESPCR) to identify specific landscapes of exon expression that are associated with DEK and WT1 oncogene expression and the resistance of AML cells to AraC, doxorubicin or azacitidine. Data were obtained for these five conditions through exon-array analysis of 17 cell lines and 24 patient samples and were extended through qESPCR of samples from 152 additional AML cases. More than 70% of AEUs identified by exon-array were technically validated through ESPCR. In vitro, 1,130 to 5,868 exon events distinguished the 5 conditions from their respective controls while in vivo 6,560 and 9,378 events distinguished chemosensitive and chemoresistant AML, respectively, from normal bone marrow. Whatever the cause of this effect, 30 to 80% of mis-spliced mRNAs involved genes unmodified at the whole transcriptional level. These AEUs unmasked new functional pathways that are distinct from those generated by transcriptional deregulation. These results also identified new putative pathways that could help increase the understanding of the effects mediated by DEK or WT1, which may allow the targeting of these pathways to prevent resistance of AML cells to chemotherapeutic agents.","Mohamed, Am; Balsat, M; Thenoz, M; Koering, C; Payen-Gay, L; Cheok, M; Mortada, H; Auboeuf, D; Pinatel, C; El-Hamri, M; Dumontet, C; Cros, E; Flandrin-Gresta, P; Nibourel, O; Preudhomme, C; Michallet, M; Thomas, X; Nicolini, F; Solly, F; Guyotat, D; Campos, L; Wattel, E; Mortreux, F",No DOI,Oncotarget
Application Of The Biolog System For Characterization Of Serratia Marcescens Ss Marcescens Isolated From Onsite Wastewater Technology (Oswt),"The scope of this study was to apply the Biolog system to identify and characterize a Serratia strain isolated from the surface of black plastic pieces which constitute the fluidized bed filter (onsite wastewater technology, OSWT). The preliminary isolation of the strain was done in the medium with tetracycline at a 16 mg/l concentration. To characterize the isolated strain, the following Biolog methods were applied: (1) EcoPlates microplates for evaluation of physiological profiling, (2) GEN III OmniLog (R) ID System for identification of the isolate, and (3) phenotypic microarrays (PM) technology for evaluation of sensitivity to antibiotics (PM11 and PM12). Results were recorded using the original OmniLog (R) software. The Serratia strain was identified as Serratia marcescens ss marcescens with similarity index 0.569. The same identification was obtained by the 16S rDNA analysis. PM analysis showed an enhancement of phenotype (resistance or growth) of this strain to 35 antibiotics. The loss of phenotype (sensitivity or non-growth) was observed only for 5 antibiotics: lomefloxacin (0.4 mu g/ml), enoxacin (0.9 mu g/ml), nalidixic acid (18.0 mu g/ml), paromomycin (25.0 mu g/ml) and novobiocin (1100 mu g/ml). This study acknowledges that the methods proposed by the Biolog system allow correct and complete identification and characterization of the microbes isolated from different environments. Phenotypic microarrays could be successfully used as a new tool for identification of the multi-antibiotic resistance of bacteria and for determination of the minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC).","Chojniak, J; Jalowiecki, L; Dorgeloh, E; Hegedusova, B; Ejhed, H; Magnér, J; Plaza, G",No DOI,Acta Biochimica Polonica

Evaluation Of Salmonella Typhimurium Biofilm Against Some Antibiotics,"Salmonella is an important bacterium causing diseases that affect humans and animals Biofilm is an organized bacterial community dwelling in any ecosystem. Microorganisms which grow as biofilm phenotypes are cause of chronic, recurrent and highly antibiotic resistant infections which are difficult to eradicate. In the present study, Salmonella Typhimurium was incubated in various media (BM, RV, NB, TSB and LB) along with various substrates (chitin, glass wool and plastic chips) to observe its ability to form biofilm. From the study, it was observed that S. Typhimurium successfully produced biofilm in all the media tested and was produced maximally when added with 1% chitin. The biofilm developed was exposed to the enzyme cellulase and it indicated that cellulase was having inhibitory effect on the biofilm. Biofilm and the normal phenotype were exposed to various antibiotics viz., amikacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and streptomycin and it was observed that increased concentration of antibiotics were required to completely inhibit biofilm when compared with the bacterium. However, antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and chloramphenicol inhibited biofilm phenotype and the bacteria at similar concentrations.","Chandra, M; Thakur, S; Narang, D; Kaur, G; Sharma, Ns",No DOI,Indian Journal Of Experimental Biology

Survival Of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producing Escherichia Coli In Dog Faeces,"Aims of study: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial- resistance amongst bacteria poses significant problems for human and veterinary medicine. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by bacteria such as Escherichia coli represents a particular concern; these enzymes confer resistance to a wide range of beta-lactam antimicrobials, including the critically important third-generation cephalosporins. Faeces from dogs with resistant bacteria may disseminate, transmit or propagate antimicrobial resistance. However, it is unknown how long such bacteria can survive in canine faeces and hence their risk in perpetuating antimicrobial resistance is uncertain. The aims of this study were to determine the survival numbers and times of ESBLproducing E. coli in dog faeces maintained at different temperatures and conditions, and to evaluate if survival of ESBL-producing E. coli differs from non-ESBL-producing, multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. Methods: Freshly collected canine faecal samples were determined to be free of ESBL-producing and MDR E. coli. These were then separately inoculated with approximately 106 CFU (colony forming units)/g of two previously obtained MDR and ESBL-producing E. coli strains retrieved from an archived culture collection. Samples were then stored in open plastic containers under three conditions: i) incubated at 23oC, ii) cold storage at 4oC and iii) outside under variable temperatures. Samples were removed at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days for enumeration of bacterial numbers on eosin methylene blue agar (EMBA) containing relevant screening antimicrobials. Recovered isolates were confirmed as E. coli with the E. coli specific uidA PCR and tested for ESBL-production and multidrug resistance. Survival curves were plotted, with regression analysis performed on the linearized survival slopes and comparison of slopes by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: All bacteria survived under all conditions for a minimum of 7 days, with both ESBL-producing and MDR E. coli surviving in high numbers (105-106 CFU/g) for at least 21 days under incubator and cold storage conditions. Bacteria were not detectable under outside conditions after 14 days for MDR E. coli and after 7 days for ESBL-producing E. coli. There was no significant difference in survival slopes between the two bacterial strains for each of the three conditions. However, there was a significant difference in the survival slopes for both ESBLproducing E. coli and MDR E. coli between the different conditions (P = 0.002 and P = 0.03 respectively). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that survival of relatively high numbers of multidrug resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli is possible in canine faeces for moderately extended periods. There does not seem to be a significant difference in survival slopes between ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing multidrug resistant E. coli strains, but for both strains survival is decreased under outside conditions. Faeces of dogs carrying antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may have role to play in maintenance of antimicrobial resistance and appropriate handling of canine faeces is important to limit the dissemination of such bacteria.","Senior S.-A., Wedley A.L., Williams N.J., Maddox T.W.",No DOI,Journal Of Small Animal Practice
"Antibiotic Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Causing Nosocomial Infection In Burn Patients Of Quetta, Pakistan","Objective: This study was planned to estimate the possible risk factor of burn wound infection, frequency and antibiotic resistant to pseudomonas aeruginosa in burn patients. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology Bolan Medical Complex Hospital Quetta from November 2018 to November 2019. Materials and Methods: A total of 270 Swab samples were collected from 137 burn wound infected patients from BMC Hospital Quetta. Samples were then subjected to culture on different microbiological media along with Gram staining different biochemical tests and antimicrobial sensitivity was done with disc diffusion procedure. Results: Revealed 220 out of 270 (81.48%) sample were contaminated with in different microorganism. Out of these positive culture n=125 (57%) strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated.

A total 125 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recovered from burn patients and the most resistance 100% antibiotic was ampicillin and doxicillin. And least resistant of drugs are azithromycin and imipenem. Conclusion: Increased trend of antimicrobial resistance is an alarming in infections in the area. Moreover, majority of burn patients were male aging above 20 years with flame burn the main cause of accident and incident.","Hussain A., Baloch B., Ahmad M., Khosa S.M., Tahir M., Sasoli N.A.",No DOI,Medical Forum Monthly
Enhancement Of Cutaneous Defenses Against Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Through Activation Of Nod2 Signaling By A Small Molecule Compound,"Bacterial infections of the skin are a major complication of wound healing. Multidrugresistant bacterial strains are rapidly emerging; therefore, it is critical to develop new therapies to combat these organisms. Prior antibacterial strategies directly target pathogen growth or viability. Host-directed strategies to increase antimicrobial defenses may be an effective alternative to antibiotics and reduce the further development of resistant strains. In this study, we demonstrate the novel efficacy of a small molecule compound to enhance clearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains by primary human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. The small molecule does not have a direct bactericidal effect, but instead enhances cellular secretion of antimicrobial peptides, including human β-defensin 2 (HBD2) and HBD3, from dermal fibroblasts. The cellular actions of the small molecule require nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIP2). Excitingly, a topical formulation of the small molecule effectively enhances the clearance of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii in human skin explants. Treatment with the topical formulation also resulted in increased production of antimicrobial peptides HBD2 and cathelicidin (LL-37) from human skin explants. Our results indicate a small molecule compound has a novel antimicrobial effect and may be a new option to combat multidrugresistant bacterial infections of the skin through enhancement of an integral pathway of the cutaneous innate immune defense system.","Jatana S., Homer C., Ponti A., Madajka M., Kabi A., Papay F., Mcdonald C.",No DOI,Journal Of Investigative Dermatology
Causative Pathogens Pattern And Clinical Outcomes In Acute Cholecystitis,"Background and Aim: As the prevalence of resistant pathogens among enteric bacteria has increased worldwide, the opportunity of encountering resistant bacteria in biliary infectious diseases increases. When multiple bacteria are detected, antimicrobial agents with a wide spectrum might be needed. The aim of this study was to determine the microbiological profile and risk of antibiotic resistance in acute cholecystitis. Methods: Among the cases of acute cholecystitis in our hospital from November 2014 to October 2016, 50 (median age 72 (39-96) years) who underwent bladder bile cultures were included in this study. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy without conservative drainage and those who had improved without drainage were excluded. Results: Of the 50 patients, 32 (64%) were males. The median age was 72 (range 39 - 96) years. There were 3 severe cases (6%), 12 moderate cases (24%), and 35 mild cases (70%) (TG 13; Updated Tokyo Guidelines). The drainage methods were 5ENGBD (endoscopic nasogallbladder drainage), 5ERGBD (endoscopic retrograde gallbladder drainage), 13EUS-GBA (endoscopic ultrasonography-guided gallbladder aspiration), 15EUS-GBD (endoscopic ultrasonography-guided gallbladder drainage), 11PTGBD (percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage), and 1PTGBA (percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder aspiration). The underlying diseases were 15 malignant diseases, 10 diabetes, 2 permanent dialysis, 7 use of immunosuppressive drugs (with overlapping cases), and 9 cases (18%) had no significant past medical history. Antithrombotic drugs were used in 16 patients (32%). Twelve patients (24%) had histories of treatment of the ampulla of Vater (4EST (endoscopic sphincterotomy), 7MS (metallic stent), 1PS (plastic stent)). Bacteria were isolated from gall bladder bile in 33 cases (66%). The isolate was: Escherichia coli 5 cases, Klebsiella spp. 5 cases, Enterobacter spp. 6 cases, Pseudomonas spp. 4, Enterococcus 10, Streptococcus spp. 2, Staphylococcus spp. 2, anaerobic bacteria 3, and others 10 (with overlapping cases). Three resistant bacteria (6%) were found, and all were ESBL (extended spectrum beta lactamase)-producing bacteria. History of treatment of the ampulla of Vater was an independent risk factor (OR: 7.40, p=0.0484) for multiple bacteria, which were detected in 13 cases (26%). Conclusion: The prevalence of resistant bacteria as the primary causative organism of acute cholecystitis in our hospital was similar to that of previous reports. Because the risk of detecting multiple bacteria from gall bladder bile was high in cases with a history of ampulla of Vater treatment, a wide-spectrum antimicrobial agent might be considered in such cases.","Okuda A., Imoto A., Imanishi M., Takagi W., Amano M., Onda S., Sano T., Ogura T., Masuda D., Higuchi K.",No DOI,Gastroenterology
Prevalence And Antibiogram Profile Of Uropathogensin A Tertiary Care Hospital,"Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common health problems worldwide. The current study was undertaken in order to determine the prevalence of UTI among symptomatic patients that were admitted in a tertiary care hospital. The pathogens responsible for UTI were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied. Methods:Subjects with clinically suspected acute UTI were enrolled in the study and their mid stream urine samples were collected in sterile plastic containers which were completely labeled. Urine samples were plated onto the blood agar and Mac Conkey agar plates with the help of wire loop under sterile conditions. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37C for 24 - 48hrs. Organisms were identified and their antibiotic resistance patterns were checked using standard guidelines. Result: Total samples collected were 765, both from females and males in the age groups 5 to 55 and above. From the total, 251 [32.8%] samples showed positive results [significant bacteriuria]. Gram positive bacteria were responsible for 12.9% and Gram negative bacteria for 87.1% of positive cases of UTI. The most common bacteria causing UTI was E. coli (37.4%).We also studied the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of alluropathogens which were isolated. Most of the Gram negative bacteria were sensitive to imipenem. In Gram positive bacteria, maximum sensitivity was noted for vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid.","Mudassar S., Ali M., Kiran N., Paracha H.M., Nayyar M.",No DOI,Pakistan Journal Of Medical And Health Sciences

Clinical And Microbiological Profile Of Patients With Acute Bacterial Cholangitis At A Tertiary Care Centre In Northern India,"Introduction: The changing antimicrobial sensitivity pattern poses a great therapeutic challenge in the modern era. With the development of antibiotic resistance due to widespread injudicious use of antibiotics, we now have very limited antibiotics against certain pathogens, especially for fatal GI emergencies like acute cholangitis. We conducted a study to assess the microbial profile and the sensitivity pattern to antibiotics in patients who presented with acute bacterial cholangitis. Methods: We enrolled all the patients admitted in our hospital between June 2023 to October 2023, who had acute bacterial cholangitis and were above 18 years of age. They were prospectively analyzed. Patient's clinical features, etiology, microbial profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern were analyzed. As soon as patient underwent any procedure all cultures were obtained. Antibiotics were administered after collecting the bile for Culture and Sensitivity. Results: Seventy six patients with acute cholangitis were evaluated. Choledocholithiasis, seen in 43 patients (56.6%) and malignancy seen in 29 patients (38.1%), were the most common factors precipitating acute cholangitis. Bile culture was positive in 62 of 76 patients (81.5%), and blood culture was positive in 23 of 76 (30.2%) patients. E. Coli followed by Klebsiella sps. were the most common organisms that were isolated from the bile culture. The organisms showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) pattern. The most common drugs to which these showed sensitivity were, Meropenem and Tigecycline. Conclusions: With more community acquired pathogens being MDR/XDR, as shown in this study, there is a prompt need to revise the antibiotic policy depending on the local resistance pattern. Acute cholangitis, is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately with broad spectrum antibiotics and Endoscopic/Percutaneous intervention depending on the expertise.","Yadav S., Seth S., Gupta R., Jain M.K., Gupta G.K., Nijhawan S.",No DOI,International Journal Of Current Pharmaceutical Review And Research
Challenges Of Achromobacter Xylosoxidans In Acute And Chronic Pediatric And Adult Wounds,"Background and Aims: We report 4 cases of wound infection sustained by Achromobacter Xylosoxidans (AX). AX is normally described for its multi drug resistance, plastic surfaces and wet enviroment trophism. The aim of this report is increasing knowledge about uncommon challenging bacterial wound infections. Materials and methods: Since 2016, patients presenting at our clinic with infected wounds, positive anamnesis for resistance to antibiotic treatments and advanced dressings undergo swab sample collection, cultured on selective MacConkey Agar and strains identified using the Microflex MALDI TOF-Biotyper ™. Susceptibility testing are performed by VITEK® 2 system and interpreted according to the guidelines defined by Antimicrobial susceptibility tests on organisms having no EUCAST breakpoints. Hospital and operators' dependent cross contamination are excluded. Results: Four patients in 3 years,(2 children aged 3,8 and two elderly aged 81, 83) presenting no other comorbidities but lower limb wounds ( traumatic etiology for children, vascular for elderly) are positive to AX. When NPWT is used frequent suspensions is required because of a rapid diffusion to perilesional skin. Patients received Candida Parapsilosis (CP) or Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) diagnosis when swabs were analized elsewhere. Antibiograms reveal multiple drug resistances excepted for colistin, carbapenems but meropenem. Both children completely defeat infection, elderly's wounds healed. Conclusions: AX is a rare but fearsome bacteria, able to infect wounds of children and elderly. It presents multiple drug-resistance and ability to persist and diffuse under polyurethane membrane as those used for NPWT. Findings of AX tissutal involvement are easily confused with SA, and its detection is possible just by advanced system otherwise misdiagnosis with other pathogens as PA or Candida spp. is the rule.","Serena C., Paola B., Annamaria S., Michaela C., Mario Z., Guido C.",No DOI,Journal Of Wound Care

Susceptibility Of Fabrics In Office Furniture To Microbial Attack: Microbial Burden And Health Implications,"Introduction: Hygiene is advocated as major in the control of infectious diseases; however an area of neglect is furniture we come in contact with daily. Furniture is made of diverse materials; wood, glass, metals, plastics, rubber, clothing fabrics or their combinations. Colonization of furniture made from different types of material and possible health implications are reported. Objectives: We investigated the associated health risk in the use of furniture made from different materials. Methods: The office setting was used and tables and seats were sampled for presence and burden of microorganisms. Also visual inspection was made for evidence of microbial attack and degradation of fabrics. Degree of susceptibility of different materials in furniture was assessed. Sampling was done after the surface was wiped with dry cloth and after cleaning with detergent solution only and in addition disinfectant. Results: Rubber fabrics were more susceptible to colonization while metal surfaces were least. Fungi were the predominant colonizers especially, Penicillium and Aspergillus species. Candida spp were isolated in 14% of the furniture sampled. Bacteria diversity included the Gram positive and Gram negative, but particular were the preponderance of Pseudomonas, Proteus, and Klebsiella. The use of dry cloth to wipe the surface had negligible role in reducing the burden of colonizing organisms. Cleaning with detergent solution reduced microbial burden by 35% while application of disinfectant yielded 90% reduction. Clothing fabric haboured more microorganisms but showed no visual signs of microbial attack. Conclusion: Furniture may serve as a pool for breeding pathogenic organisms if not properly maintained. Regular cleaning with detergent and disinfectant is advocated.","Egwari L.O., Oniha M.I., Ayepola O.O.",No DOI,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Into The Mediastinum And Out Of The Papilla-Minimal Invasive Endoscopic Therapy In Two Body Cavities With One Instrument,"Background / Case: A 48 years old female patient with known chronic ethylic pancreatitis presented with new onset of fever and dysphagia. She had highly elevated infectious parameters (C-Reactive Protein 399 mg/L, total leucocytes 10,9x109/L). Computed tomography revealed a large cystic supradiaphragmatic paraesophageal structure and two small retroperitoneal cysts near the pancreatic body. Endoscopic methods: Transesophageal endosonographic fine needle aspiration showed pus and an elevated amylase so the diagnosis of an infected pancreatic pseudocyst (pp) was made. Consequently a 10French (Fr) double pigtail catheter and a 7Fr nasocystic tube were inserted transesophageally. Infection was treated with intravenous penicillin according to antimicrobial resistance of the detected streptococcus anginosus. She was put on total parenteral nutrition. With a second intervention merely two weeks after admission, using a 10Fr digital endoscope, we were able to locate and pass the transhiatal fistula of the pp after balloon dilatation to reach the caudally located smaller part of the pp. This primary retroperitoneal pp had expanded into the thoracic cavity and provoked the dysphagia. The small pp had evoked from a ruptured pancreatic duct. After several unsuccessful attempts, a 0.035 inch guide wire was passed under visual guidance through the pp into the pancreatic duct. The wire was then advanced via the papilla of vateri into the duodenum and extracted orally. By holding the guide wire tightly on both ends we were able to support the difficult and precise placement of a 5Fr 13centimeter plastic stent into the pancreatic duct, via the thoracic and abdominal part of the pp. The proximal end was placed visually in the small abdominal cystic part and the distal end was located in the duodenum. Nasocystic tube and double pigtail catheter were removed and the esophago-cystic access was closed using two hemoclipps. Subsequently both the thoracic and the abdominal part of the pp collapsed totally and the patient recovered completely. After three months the stent was replaced transpapillarily and completely removed two months later. The patient continued to be asymptomatic. Clinical implication: To our knowledge this is the first reported endoscopic procedure passing a single endoscope extra-intestinally into both the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Here with we were able to treat a large infected transhiatal pancreatic pseudocyst by precisely placing a stent under visual control. The new slim digital endoscopy technology enables procedures outside the range of normal endoscopes even outside intestinal structures on both sides of the diaphragm.","Magdeburg B., Greuter T., Husarik D.B.",No DOI,Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
Microbiological Spectrum Of Infected Pancreatic Necrosis In Patients Requiring Drainage After Failure Of Systemic Antibiotics,"Objectives Systemic antibiotics are the first-line therapy of infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN). Information about germs infecting the necrosis after failure of systemic antibiotics is scarce. Our aim is to evaluate the microbiological spectrum and antibiotic resistance of IPN in a cohort of patients undergoing endoscopic transmural drainage (ETD) after failure of systemic antibiotics Methods Retrospective, descriptive, observational study of patients admitted at our Department of Gastroenterology from January 2015 to December 2016, who underwent ETD of IPN due to persistent signs of sepsis despite systemic carbapenem therapy. Endoscopic ultrasoundguided ETN was performed by using plastic and metal stents. A transmural naso-cystic tube was placed for sampling of fluid content for microbiological culture, lavage and local infusion of antibiotics (carbapenem in all cases) according to a previously published protocol from our group (Pancreatology 2016;16:719-25). Results of microbiological culture of the sample obtained at the time of placing the naso-cystic tube and at oneweek intervals until tube removal were recorded. A descriptive analysis of germs infecting pancreatic necrosis and their resistance profile is carried out. Results Out of 694 acute pancreatitis patients admitted in our Department over the study period, 21 developed IPN (3%). Eleven patients required ETD. Infection was initially polymicrobial in seven patients (Staphylococcus [36%], Streptococcus [27%], E.coli [27%], Enterococcus [27%] and Candida spp. [27%] being the most frequent germs) and monomicrobial in four (E.Coli in three of them, 75%). Infection was mainly monomicrobial in 8 and 6 patients with persistent infection after one and two-week therapy respectively (Candida spp [37% and 50%] being the most frequent germ). 23.8% of 21 initially isolated germs was resistant to one antibiotic, mainly penicillin and carbapenem). After one and two-weeks of drainage and local and systemic antibiotic therapy, antibiotic resistance was shown in 41.7% and 25% of isolated germs, respectively. Conclusion Infection of pancreatic necrosis is often polymicrobial after failure of systemic antibiotic therapy. Endoscopic drainage associated with local and systemic carbapenem therapy frequently lead to persistent monomicrobial infection, mainly by Candida spp. Penicillin and carbapenem resistance develops frequently in these patients.","Lariño-Noia J., De La Iglesia-García D., Iglesias-Garcia J., Macías-García F., Gonzalez J., López-Diaz J., Dominguez-Muñoz J.E.",No DOI,Pancreatology
Study And Comparison Of Biofilm Formation By Regional Clostridium Spp. Strains,"Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic gram-positive pathogen, causative agent of numerous diseases, biofilm with ability to form biofilm, recently informed. C. septicum, like C. perfringens is an opportunistic pathogen causative agent of myonecrosis. C. chauvoei is the causative agent of the stain, an infectious disease considered endemic in San Luis province. Bacterial biofilms are communities of cells adhered to surfaces, immersed in a extracellular matrix of that protects the antibiotic attack and increases its resistance. The aim of this work was characterize phenotypically the biofilm formation of C. perfringens, C. septicum and C. chauvoei and compare with our preliminary studies on different surface. Strains used: C. perfringens ATCC 3624, C. septicum ATCC 12464 and C. chauvoei ATCC 10092. For the biofilm formation, Petri dishes with OMA (optimized medium for anaerobes) containing coverslips were cultured at 37°C in anaerobic conditions for 24, 48 and 72 h. For the planktonic and sessile cells analysis, Gram, 0,1% crystal violet colorations and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. Quantification of biofilm and planktonic cells was performed by Abs 570/DO580 relationship. For statistical analysis Student's test was used. At 24 h a good production of biofilm was obtained, their proportion increase to 48 and 72 h for 3 strains. The Abs570/DO580 at 48 h of culture showed that the biofilm formation efficiency in glass surface was C. perfringens> C. septicum> C. chauvoei (p≤0.05). The same was observed with optical microscopy and similar results were observed with SEM. The biofilm formation on polystyrene plastic was as following: C. septicum> C. perfringens> C. chauvoei (p≤0.05). Influence of different surfaces on biofilm formation and affinity for bacterial adhesion to various materials was evidenced. The ability to form biofilm is very important in the pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance because difficult the diseases treatment caused by these microorganisms.","Pérez C.N., Guerra R.A., Villa M.C., Stagnitta P.",No DOI,Biocell
Plasma Sterilization As An Innovative Tool To Inactivate Bacillus Subtilis Endospores For Improved Surface Decontamination,"Question: The process of sterilization is absolutely essential in medical settings and health care in order to assure hospital hygiene and facilitate safe surgical procedures, thereby preventing nosocomial infections and spreading of multi-resistant bacteria. Being the most resilient form of a biological system, bacterial endospores are extremely resistant against a broad spectrum of sterilization methods and therefore are commonly used as a bioindicator in order to verify functionality of a decontamination process [1]. Many conventional sterilization methods suffer from disadvantages by either introducing damage to sensitive material, alteration of surface properties, or insufficient removal of potentially pathogenic biological material. The process of low-pressure plasma sterilization is a promising alternative to conventional sterilization methods as it is fast, efficient and gentle to heat-sensitive material, such as innovative medical plastics, due to low-temperatures operations (30-80°C) [2, 3]. In addition to the applied electrical field, plasma discharges contain a high degree of UV/VUVradiation, as well as charged particles and free radicals, which exert detrimental effects on microorganisms by damaging genetic material, outer cell layers and proteins [2]. Methods: The double inductively coupled plasma reactor (DICP) is an innovative low-pressure plasma system, which allows homogeneous sterilization of large surface areas by effectively inactivating and removing bacterial spores within minutes [4].In this study we present novel insights into the key factors involved in spore inactivation by low pressure plasma sterilization using a DICP reactor. Results and Conclusion: Particular proteins of the multi-layered spore coat -the first barrier to environmental influences - were revealed to be major factors contributing to spore resistance towards plasma treatment. With a systematic analysis of Bacillus subtilis spores lacking individual coat and crust layers we observed significant morphological differences in coat structures by AFManalysis, affecting spore survival and resistant properties after treatment with low-pressure plasma and isolated plasma components. We identified spore-specific and general DNA repair pathways during spore germination, leading to a better understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the plasma sterilization process.","Raguse M., Fiebrandt M., Stapelmann K., Narberhaus F., Awakowicz P., Moeller R.",No DOI,International Journal Of Medical Microbiology
Outbreak Of Chryseobacterium Indologenes Infection Related To A Contaminated Water Pipe,"Purpose: Chryseobacterium indologenes is an environmental organism which usually causes opportunistic infection in humans. Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) due to contaminated devices by the organism with multidrug resistance is a threat to hospitalized patients, especially those with severe underlying diseases. Between October and December, 2013, a significant increase of C. indologenes HAI infection was found in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan. The present study was undertaken to investigate the source of infection for the suspected outbreak. Methods: A total of 6 patients were found to have HAI of post-surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and bacteremia by C. indologenes. On-site inspection of daily nursing care procedures was conducted. Cultures of sputum specimens from patients and swab samples from the ICU environment were performed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to delineate the genetic relationship among the isolates. Results: A total of 86 specimens, including 18 sputum and 68 environmental specimens were collected. C. indologenes was identified from one sputum and 4 surface swabs from the furniture and equipments within the ICU. All isolates, including those from patients, demonstrated identical PFGE patterns. The colonization of C. indologenes on a plastic pipe attached to the tap in the washing room may have led to the subsequent contamination of the ICU environment. On-site inspection also found that hand hygiene policy and infection control measures were not adequately implemented. Re-education of the personnel, removal of the contaminated water pipe, and daily cleaning of the environment with hypochlorite solutions successfully stopped the outbreak. Conclusions: The significant increase of C. indologenes HAI in the ICU was an outbreak probably originated from a contaminated water pipe used to clean sputum suction bottles. On-site inspection and intervention as well as the molecular typing analysis provided solid evidence and helped to terminate the outbreak.","Su L.-H., Tang Y.-F., Su L.-H.",No DOI,"Journal Of Microbiology, Immunology And Infection"

G15 Sensitizes Epithelial Breast Cancer Cells To Doxorubicin By Preventing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Through Inhibition Of Gpr30,"Resistance to single or multiple chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in breast cancer therapy. Recent studies have suggested that GPR30 is implicated in mediating cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to examine the anti-tumor effects of the GPR30 antagonist G15 in breast cancer. We found that low concentrations of G15 had little effect on breast cancer cell viability, but could enhance doxorubicin sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with epithelial phenotypes. In addition, G15 prevented epithelial breast cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) after doxorubicin induction. Moreover, downregulation of GPR30 suppressed the EMT in breast cancer cells. These results support that G15 enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity and prevented the EMT in epithelial breast cancer cells by inhibiting GPR30 expression.","Liu Y., Du F.-Y., Chen W., Fu P.-F., Yao M.-Y., Zheng S.-S.",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
The Importance Of Vaporizing Hydrogen Peroxide In Decontamination,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of decontamination of laboratory animal rooms with the vapor-phase of hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Additionally, we examined material compatibilities with vaporized hydrogen peroxide. The laboratory animal room was exposed to VHP. The effects of decontamination with VHP were determined by biological indicators. 39 kinds of materials were exposed by 100 cycles to VHP in the test chamber. The materials tested contained plastics, metals, woods and plating or coating goods. According to the fourgrade system, we evaluated the materials abilities to undergo exposure to vaporized hydrogen peroxide. Laboratory animal facilities need especially cleanliness environment. Therefore the floor becomes the factor that is important to the maintenance of the cleanliness. We considered ultraviolet cured resin coating to floor. Ultraviolet (UV) curable resin combines strongly when it receives UV dose. By this strong combination, UV coating shows a lot higher performance than a general floor wax. UV cured resin is low odor and organic-solvent-free because of waterborne lacquer. Good re-coatability even after UV curing. Excellent scratch resistance, abrasion resistance and stain resistance The exposure test to VHP provided complete sterilized effects at room humidity of not more than 75 %. Some damage was found in copper, brass, chromium plate and galvanized iron immediately following exposure to VHP. Repeated decontamination caused marked damage in stainless steel and urethane-, siliconeor epoxy-coating materials. Condensation of VHP posed severe damage for the surface the materials. We confirmed that VHP immediately sterilized microorganisms. The increasing concentrations of VHP with condensation caused severe changes in the materials during prolonged exposure. It was highly important to decontaminate with VHP.","Kimura T., Yahata H., Uchiyama Y., Ichihara H.",No DOI,Experimental Animals
Laboratory-Based Evaluation Of Mdr Strains Of Pseudomonas In Patients With Acute Burn Injuries,"Localization of burn was variable: head and face in 76 patients (29%), trunk in 58 (49%), upper limb in 37 (52%), lower limbs in 44 (41%), hands in 16 (15%), perinea area in 26 (5.5%) and whole body except perinea area in 10 (9%) patients. Inhalation syndrome was present in 56 (44%) patients. Ninety patients (82%) had indwelling venous catheters, 83 (75.5%) patients’ arterial catheter and 86 (78%) patients’ urinary catheters. By multivariate analysis: age ≤4 years, Garcés 4, colistin use in documented multiresistant infections, and mechanical ventilation were independent variables related with mortality and graft requirement was a protective factor for mortality. Despite advances in care, gram negative bacterial infections and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain the most common cause of bacteria related mortality early in the hospital course. Viral infections are also associated with mortality and numbers have remained stable when compared to data from prior years.","Zhang H.-T., Liu H.",No DOI,International Journal Of Clinical And Experimental Medicine
Synthesis And Antimicrobial Evaluation Of Novel Amide Synthesized From Nonbiodegradable Pet Waste,"The antimicrobial effect of compound terephthalic dihydrazide (synthesized through amminolysis of PET waste) and its complex formed through its complexation with lanthanum nitrate, a well known antimicrobial agent, were investigated on different fungal species after their characterization through elemental analysis and various spectroscopic studies i.e. FTIR, UV-Visible, NMR etc. They were screened for in vitro antifungal activity against multidrug resistive Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma lignorum. The conidia of test fungal species were exposed to both amide and its complex at variable concentration from 0.4 mg/ml-1.0 mg/ml media at 37 °C. The results of bioactive assay showed that synthesized amide suppressed growth of fungi and displayed better antimicrobial activities against tested strains as compared to its complex. Studies were also extended to check the effect of amide on growth, morphology, reproduction and cone, of biochemical constituents of test fungi.","Soni R.K., Bhardwaj M.",No DOI,Journal Of The Indian Chemical Society

Does Cefuroxime-Amikacinmetronidazole Provide Adequate And Appropriate Antiobiotic Coverage For Pancreaticoduodenectomy In Developing Countries: A Prospective Study,"Objectives: Antibiotic stewardship is mandatory in contemporary clinical practice. This new oncology hospital in Eastern-India had instituted antibiotic policies based on practices prevalent in developed nation. The present study explores their relevance in biliary microflora in patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD). Methods: During PD, bile was aspirated from bile duct and detailed record of microbiology and antibiogram was maintained. The data were prospectively captured in a bespoke electronic database. Results: Between October 2011 and August 2014, 52 patients underwent PD for myriad malignant conditions [male: 37, female: 16; median age: 57 years, IQR 51-64]. Of this, 37 (71%) had pre-operative biliary stenting (plastic: 23, metal: 9, both types: 1). Median interval between stent placement and PD was 28 days (IQR 22-42). Of the 15 non-stented patients, bile was sterile in 11 (73%), while all, but 2, stented patients harboured microbes. In these 35 stented patients, bile from 8, 15 and 12 patients grew 1, 2 and 3 flora respectively. Of these 74 samples, 45 (61%) were gram negative, 24 (32%) gram positive and 5 were candida. Amongst the gram negatives, Klebsiella pneumoniae (38%) and Escherichia coli (33%) constituted the predominant organisms and their sensitivity towards commonly used antibiotics were: Amikacin (67%), Co-amoxyclav (20%), Carbapenem (62%), Piperacillin- Tazobactam (42%) and Colistin (96%). Cefuroxime, tested in 29 samples, was found sensitive in 5 (17%) only. Conclusion: High incidence of multi-drug resistant bacteria in bile samples in stented is an ominous finding. This mandates close cooperation between the gastroenterologist and the surgeon and revision of antibiotic policies.","Gaurav R., Banerjee S., Bhattacharya S., Chatterjee S., Mallath M., Roy M.",No DOI,Hpb

Investigation Into The Effects Of Testosterone On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes In Hepatic And Intestinal Human Cell Lines,"Introduction Testosterone is a well-established probe substrate for assessing functional levels of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism. Parenteral testosterone replacement therapy is commonly prescribed for male hypogonadism, given the low oral bioavailability of oral testosterone. However, some investigators are exploring the oral delivery of testosterone or its esters using specialized formulations that might promote lymphatic intestinal absorption. Exogenous administration of hormones is known to down-regulate endogenous production, which could lead to less than expected increases in exposure with repeated administration, but other factors such as self-induction of metabolism could also contribute. There is little if any substantive information available that sheds light on whether or not testosterone has any inductive effects on CYP3A4 mediated metabolism, or on any other CYP isoforms. The intent of this study was to use intestinal and hepatic human cell lines to assess for possible induction of CYP3A4 and CYP1A1. Methods Human hepatic (HepG2) and colonic/intestinal (Lovo) cell lines were grown in 12 well plates and spiked with testosterone (300, 3000 or 30000 ng/dL once or twice daily for 3 days). Control cells were similarly treated with matching media minus testosterone. At the end of the 3 days of treatment, some cells were used to measure mRNA and protein for CYP1A1, CYP3A4, and multidrug resistance protein (MDR1). In addition, the effect of testosterone pretreatment on its own in vitro clearance, and CYP1A1-specific functional activity (using 7-ethoxyin O-deethylase activity) were also tested in the cell lines. Results Based on the mRNA and protein measures, there was no evidence of a testosterone-related change in protein expression of the target genes or housekeeping genes. Functional studies indicated no change in CYP1A1 activity. Using a LC-MS assay method, the cells lines displayed a rapid decrease in testosterone concentrations; it was established that there was no binding of testosterone to the plastic well plates used in the studies. HepG2 cells preexposed with 3000 ng/dL twice daily testosterone for 3 d had no associated changes in testosterone clearance after the testosterone preexposure phase. In the Lovo cells, testosterone pretreatment with 30000 ng/dL of testosterone was associated with an apparent inhibition in vitro of testosterone clearance. The testosterone concentrations exposed to intestinal cells were higher than liver cells because enterocyte exposure after oral administration would be expected to greatly exceed those in the liver. Conclusion There was no evidence for induction of testosterone metabolism in vitro using human liver and intestinal cell lines. The decrease in testosterone clearance in the intestinal cells after preexposure might have been due to accumulation of metabolites, with a pursuant competitive or noncompetitive inhibition of testosterone metabolism.","Brocks D.R., Abdussalam A., Elsherbiny A.A., Elshenawy O.H., Oefelein M.G., Betageri G.V., Thirucote T.R.",No DOI,Faseb Journal
Antibiotic Prophylaxis In Elective Hand Surgery,"Purpose Antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the rate of surgical site infection in a broad spectrum of surgical procedures. However, in patients undergoing elective hand surgery, there is evidence of lower efficacy, and its use might be related to the development of antimicrobial resistance. The side effects and higher health-related costs must also be taken into consideration. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in these procedures. Material and methods A retrospective study was conducted including all patients who underwent clean, elective hand surgery lasting less than 30 minutes from January 1st 2014 to December 31st 2015 at our hospital. The demographic and surgery-related data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US) software, version 23.0. Results A total of 346 patients matched the study’s inclusion criteria. The infection rate was of 1%, and it was not influenced by gender, age or diabetes mellitus. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in 52% of the cases, and it had no effect on the decrease in the infection rate, even in the group of diabetic patients. Conclusions Despite the inherent limitations of any retrospective study, our data analysis supports the fact that prophylactic antibiotic administration does not reduce the incidence of surgical site infection in clean, elective hand surgery that lasts less than 30 minutes, even in patients at risk.","Vasconcelos C., Serra M., Nogueira R., Do Carmo L.",No DOI,Revista Iberoamericana De Cirugia De La Mano
"Buried Penis In Adults-Presentation, Surgical Techniques And Outcome","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Buried penis in adult men is a rare, usually acquired condition in which the penis is partially or completely hidden below the surface of the prepubic skin and/or scrotum, although the corporeal length of penile shaft is normal. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presentation, treatment options and results of surgical treatment of buried penis in adults, a previously under reported entity. METHODS: A total of 54 patients (mean age 55.6 ± 19.6 years) underwent surgery for buried penis between 2007 and 2013 were included in this retrospective study. The aetiology of buried penis was multifactorial, the most common factors were obesity (79.6 %) and/or previous treatment of penile cancer (16.6 %) or circumcision (31.5 %). The presentation of buried penis included voiding difficulties in 24(44.4%), sexual dysfunction in 16 (29.6 %), recurrent balanoposthitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans in 12 (22.2 %) and aesthetic concerns in 16 (29.6 %) patients. Surgical techniques included suprapubic fat pad excision, abdominoplasty, apronectomy, split/fullthickness skin graft, division of the suspensory ligament, scrotoplasty and excision of foreskin. RESULTS: Mean hospital stay was 5.1 days (range 1 - 14). 46 patients (85.2 %) were satisfied with the results of the surgery. 4 patients (7.4 %) underwent further additional corrective surgery: in 2 patients the suspensory ligament division and scrotoplasty, in 1 patient scrotoplasty and in 1 patient repeated abdominoplasty. The following complications were recorded in 8 (14.8[S1] %) patients: wound infection in 4 (7.4%) patients, lost of skin graft in 2 (3.7%) patients, hematoma and deep venous thrombosis in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of the buried penis in adults is a complex procedure with a high satisfactory rate. The overall morbidity of the procedure was low and less than 10% of patients required further surgery to achieve optimum results. However, the complexity of the procedures would mean that performing these in specialised centres is recommended.","Yap T., Chocolaty M., Amr R., Garaffa G., Christopher N., Minhas S., David R.",No DOI,Journal Of Urology
Can We Rely On Pyuria As A Marker For Uti In The Neurogenic Bladder?: An 11 Year Longitudinal Analysis,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In this era of increasing antibiotic resistance, accurate diagnosis of infection before treatment is imperative. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a leading cause of morbidity and healthcare utilization for patients with neurogenic bladder and also poses a major diagnostic dilemma. The interpretation of pyuria as a marker for UTI in these patients may be confounded by repeated catheterizations, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or reconstructive surgery. To determine the stability of pyuria in asymptomatic patients with neurogenic bladder we studied the effect of time, catheterization, and bladder surgery on the presence of urinary leukocytes. METHODS: All patients evaluated at our institution's Spina Bifida Clinic since 2004 were eligible. Electronic records were reviewed and only results of microscopic urine analyses obtained the same day as routine, well clinic visits were included. Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) status at the time of urine collection and bladder surgical history (ie: reimplant, augment, Mitrofanoff, vesicostomy) were recorded. Analysis of repeated measurements was done with SAS, using multi-level modeling with random effects. RESULTS: 53 patients (32 female, 21 male) were evaluated during well visits between March 2004 to March 2015. There were on average 10 visits (range 2-41) per person. 319 urine samples were included for analysis. 51% (27/53) of patients transitioned during the study period from spontaneously voiding to CIC. 28% (15/53) of patients underwent some form of bladder surgery. Pyuria increased on average with time, CIC, and bladder surgery but not significantly. Within individual variance was significant (p<0.001) and 6 times greater than between individual variance, accounting for 58%-86% of the total variation as age increased. Adjusting for age, CIC, or bladder surgery did not reduce intra-individual variance. CONCLUSIONS: Pyuria varies unpredictably in asymptomatic children with neurogenic bladder. Accordingly, pyuria does not appear to be useful as a point of care marker for UTI, underscoring the importance of the need to search for other inflammatory biomarkers in these complex patients.","Su R., Palta M., Lim A., Sauder C., Wald E.",No DOI,Journal Of Urology
Comparison Of The Efficacy Of Surface Disinfectants In The Decontamination Of Surfaces Sprayed With Common Nosocomial Bacteria,"Disinfection is an important part of the management of healthcare facilities as most nosocomial infections result from ineffective disinfection policies. MRSA, ESBL Escherichia coli, MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the most common and concerning pathogens associated with nosocomial infections. The study aims to compare and determine which among the disinfectants available would be most effective against the aforementioned common nosocomial bacteria in decontaminating surfaces commonly found in the hospital setting. In the Alkafeel Super Specialty Hospital, these pathogens were inoculated from different sources within the facility, cultured and tested for their sensitivity in the hospital’s laboratory; namely, MRSA, ESBL E. coli, MDR K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were then used to contaminate surfaces of different composition, namely plastic, leather and metal separately, all surfaces present within the facility. A mixture of the aforementioned strains was also used to contaminate the surfaces. The antiseptics used to disinfect these surfaces were hypochlorous acid, Dermacyn, Optical, and ADSF. Among the antiseptics tested, hypochlorous acid was found to be most effective and efficient in eradicating all strains of bacteria including the mixture on different surfaces. This is followed marginally by Optical which was able to inhibit growth of these bacteria on the different surfaces except plastic where the one contaminated with the mixed strain showed only reduced growth. This is then followed by a large margin by ADSF, which though was effective against the mixed strain and MRSA on different surfaces, had little to no effect on the other pathogens on different surfaces, except metal, and lastly Dermacyn, which was mostly effective against pathogens on a metallic surface. The study was able to determine that each disinfectant has its advantages and disadvantages with regard to the surface contaminated and the strain the surface is infected with. Among these, hypochlorous acid was determined to be the most effective and efficient in the decontamination of different surfaces against different strains. This is followed by Optical, ADSF and lastly, Dermacyn in order from most effective and efficient to least.",Al-Ibrahemy J.S.S.,No DOI,Latin American Journal Of Pharmacy

Stat6 Upregulation Promotes M2 Macrophage Polarization To Suppress Atherosclerosis,"BACKGROUND Macrophages are highly heterogeneous and plastic cells that are involved in all stages of atherogenesis. They can undergo polarization by shifting between M1 and M2 functional phenotypes. However, the role of macrophage polarization and the molecular mechanism in modulating atherosclerotic plaque stability remain incompletely understood. Our study investigated the role of STAT6 in regulating macrophage phenotypes to affect atherosclerotic plaque stability. MATERIAL AND METHODS A murine atherosclerosis model with vulnerable plaques was induced with high-cholesterol diet and PCCP surgeries in ApoE-/- mice. Murine macrophages RAW264.7 treated with ox-LDL or IL-4 were used to simulate the in vitro process. pcDNA3.1(-)/STAT6-expressing vectors were transfected into RAW264.7 to evaluate its effect on cell polarization and the involved molecules. RESULTS Unstable plaques presented significantly increased M1 markers (CD86 and iNOS) and less M2 markers (Arg-1 and TGF-β) than the stable plaques. Moreover, we found that STAT6 and p-STAT6 were greatly decreased in the vulnerable plaques and ox-LDL-induced macrophages, while their expression was elevated after IL-4 stimulation. The overexpression of STAT6 substantially reversed the ox-LDL-stimulated macrophage apoptosis and lipid accumulation. STAT6 upregulation promoted the differentiation of macrophage to M2 subtype as reflected by the increased expression of Arg-1 and TGF-β. Furthermore, we found that STAT6 overexpression activated the Wnt-β-catenin signaling by enhancing the translocation of β-catenin, while β-catenin suppression inhibited STAT6 overexpression-induced M2 polarization. CONCLUSIONS STAT6 facilitated atherosclerotic plaque stabilization by promoting the polarization of macrophages to M2 subtype and antagonizing ox-LDL-induced cell apoptosis and lipid deposition in a Wnt-β-catenin-dependent manner.","Gong M., Zhuo X., Ma A.",No DOI,Medical Science Monitor Basic Research
"Investigation Into Antimicrobial Resistance, Enterotoxin And Cassette Chromosome Gene Of Staphylococcus Aureus Isolates From Humans, Cows And Goats In Taiwan","Multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDR S. aureus) is predominately present in humans and animals. Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) is one of the representative toxins produced by S. aureus. The drug resistance patterns, presence of eighteen SE genes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) in S. aureus strains isolated from human cellulitis, septicemia, mastitis and farmed ruminant mastitis were investigated and analyzed. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) accounted for 51.35% (76/148) and 48.65% (72/148), respectively. Both MSSA and MRSA carried sea (15%), seb (30.8%) and sek (27.5%) genes. Eighty percent of the MRSA strains (52/65) belonged to SCCmec types I, III and IV while the MSSA strains were mostly untypable. Molecular examination of SE genes showed that sec might be highly crucial for goat S. aureus mastitis while sel might play a role in human, goat and cow mastitis. Enterotoxin A gene displayed the highest rate of appearance in the isolates from cow S. aureus mastitis as the enterotoxin was also found in human cellulitis, septicemia and mastitis, showing its key role in bovine mastitis and cross-species implications between humans and cows. MDR S. aureus widely appeared in human hospitals and community, and goat mastitis, whereas the strains accounted for much lower prevalence in cow mastitis. The data indicate that the patterns of SE gene are probably host species-specific and source-associated; therefore, the identification of SE genes coupled with SCCmec typing might be a useful method to trace the sources of infection in farmed ruminants and humans.","Chu C.-S., Huang H.H., Chiang S.-H., Chou C.-C., Lai J.-M., Shih W.-L., Changchien C.-H., Lin H.-C., Chuang S.-T., Su Y.-C.",No DOI,Thai Journal Of Veterinary Medicine
"A Hospital Based Observational Evaluation To Determine Clinical, Microbiological, And Histopathological Characteristics Of Patients Diagnosed With Burn Wound Infection","Aim: The objective of the study was to determine clinical, microbiological, and histopathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with Burn wound infection along with a positive quantitative biopsy culture and their relationship with early diagnosis and progression to burn wound sepsis. Methods: This study included all the patients admitted in the last 6 months to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Patna, Bihar, India and who were diagnosed with BWI and BWS, according to the American's Burn Association (ABA) criteria. A total of 500 burned patients were admitted to the Burn Unit, out of these 50/500 (10%) developed BWI, based on clinical diagnosis, and 11/50 (22%) progressed to BWS. Results: Scalds were the most frequent cause, followed by contact burns; second-degree burns predominated. The majority had less than 20% TBSA burns in adults and less than 10% TBSA burns in children. However, 23 (46%) had major burns. Of these, 30 (60%) were adults and 20 (40%) children. Most of them presented with more than one burned anatomical area, and the most frequent regions involved were the upper limbs, followed by the lower limbs. All patients with BWS had major burns. Among the signs of infection, erythema was predominant (redness greater than 1 cm from the burn wound border), followed by edema, and exudate and eschar discoloration. With regard to clinical presentation, latency period was defined as the time between burn wound and first signs of infection; early if clinical signs were evidenced into the first 72 hours since admission in Burn Unit and late if occurred after this time. Most cases developed signs in the first 72 hours after arrival at Burn Unit (47; 94%), corresponding to early infection. Conclusion: BWI increases hospitalization time and number of surgeries, increasing the risk of sepsis and death. The QBC allows an accurate diagnosis with lesser false-positive cases that impact antibiotic resistance and mortality. Protocols targeting this problem are needed to decrease the impact of this.",Priyadarshini P.,No DOI,International Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Clinical Research
Population Dynamics Of Tumor-Specific Cd8 T Cell Differentiation From Plastic To Fixed Dysfunctional States,"Tumor-specific CD8 T cells (TST) encountering cognate antigen in tumors differentiate to a dysfunctional state characterized by expression of multiple inhibitory receptors and failure to make effector cytokines. We demonstrated that TST differentiate through two discrete chromatin states; TST were initially in a plastic chromatin state and could be functionally rescued but then transitioned to a fixed chromatin state resistant to therapeutic reprogramming. T cells harboring these discrete chromatin states could be identified with distinct, novel membrane protein expression profiles, permitting prospective identification of reprogrammable tumor-specific T cells from bulk tumor-infiltrating T cell populations. Importantly, human tumor-infiltrating PD1-high CD8 T cells were in a similar chromatin accessibility state as murine fixed dysfunctional T cells. Based on our studies, two models could describe TST differentiation: (i) TST progress en-masse from the plastic to fixed state, potentially through a transitional state or (ii) individual TST within a population exist in either the plastic or fixed dysfunctional state; initially, most TST are in the plastic state, however over time plastic T cells fail to proliferate or die while the fixed dysfunctional TST preferentially proliferate and/or survive. To test these models, we carried out single-cell RNA-Sequencing on TST at various time points during tumor progression. Determining the population dynamics of TST differentiation through dysfunctional states in tumors could inform our strategies for TST rescue, for example, by selecting rare plastic TST from bulk populations versus novel strategies to reprogram the epigenome of fixed dysfunctional TST.","Philip M., Pilkinton M., Ramesh R., Mcdonnell W.J., Gangula R.D., Camara S., Chopra A., Schietinger A., Mallal S.A.",No DOI,Journal Of Immunology
Surgical Site Infections' Prevention With Silver Sulfadiazine,"Background and Aims: Very often, the surgical site is susceptible to infection in patients undergoing general surgery, orthopedic surgery, etc. Surgical Site Infections (ISCs) involve an extension of hospitalization, intensive care and further surgical procedures. ISCs are associated with a high risk of mortality. The European surveillance protocol 1 is based on the predefined concepts of the surgical wound, the surgical activity, the health context, and finally, the antibioticresistance recorded in the health context and the isolation of pathogens. Based on the data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2, most surgical infections are endogenous or exogenous, resulting from contamination in the operating room. Therefore, a standardization of aesepsi procedures in the operating room has been elaborated. Antibiotic prophylaxis is performed in all surgical procedures. Topically, from an international protocol, the topical antibiotic cannot be used except for the silver sulfadiazine. Methods: In our study, we used micronized silver sulfadiazine and lidocaine hydrochloride as needed. In 2017-2018, 20 patients between the ages of 25 and 94 were treated. The lesions treated were of different kinds and the patients had different comorbidities. The timing of control dressings was 5.10 and 15 days. The protocol developed by our team includes the application of sulfadiazine cream in the operating room, after disinfection, with sodium hypochlorite, proceeding with the use of sterile gauzes and premedicated waxing. Results: We have not found any kind of silver intolerance in our patients. Our treatment has reported excellent results in wound healing over 15 days without complications. Follow-up was performed in the interval of 5, 10 and 15 days. Our results were excellent and the use of practices in the operating theater would be desirable. Conclusion: The application of silver micronized sulfadiazine optimizes the cost-benefit ratio, reduces hospitalization times by preventing surgical site infections, improving healing processes and improving the patient's quality of life. Furthermore, the development of antibiotic resistance decreases without requiring the simultaneous prolonged use of systemic antibiotics.","Barbara D.A., Fabrizio O., Morais D'Autilio Margarida F.L., Pietro G., Valerio C.",No DOI,Journal Of Wound Care
Candidiasis: Prevalence And Resistance Profiling In A Tertiary Care Hospital Of Pakistan,"Objective: To determine Candida colonisation/infection in renal transplant patients and to determine the resistance pattern against antifungal drugs. Method: This prospective, observational study was conducted at Al-Sayyed Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from January to October 2014, in collaboration with the Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory's, Islamabad campus..The clinical specimens investigated included respiratory tract secretions, blood, urine, high vaginal swab, skin scrapings, and plastic devices samples. Results: Of the 7,850 samples, 164(2.08%) were positive for Candida. Candida albicans were most prevalent as they were found in 114(69%) samples. Besides, 56(34%) of the positive samples were resistant to one or more antifungal agents. Highest resistance was obtained against fluconazole. We found only 5(3.04%) positive samples of Candida glabrata; of them, 3(60%)were resistant. In case of Candida spp, 27(48%) resistance was observed. In Candida albicans, 23(41%) of the samples were found to be resistant. Most of the Candida isolates was recovered from bronchial alveolar lavage. Conclusion: Although Candida albicans remained the main responsible species for Candida infections, but non-albican Candida species are also emerging.","Jamil B., Bokhari M.T.M., Saeed A., Bokhari M.Z.M., Hussain Z., Khalid T., Bokhari H., Imran M., Abbasi S.A.",No DOI,Journal Of The Pakistan Medical Association
Assessment Of The Possible Association Between Phthalate Exposure And Subfertility Problem In Egyptian Men,"Di butyl phthalate (DBP) is a phthalate ester with extensive use in industry in such products as plastic (PVC) piping, nail polishes, paper coatings, dental materials, pharmaceuticals, and plastic food wrap. There is high potential for human exposure to di butyl phthalate in the workplace and the home environment through direct sources as well as indirectly, through contamination of water, air, and foodstuffs. In the current study we aimed to evaluate correlation between phthalate and male sub fertility by determination of mono butyl phthalate (DBP metabolite) in urine using high performance liquid chromatography (HLPC). We recruited 166 men who were part of sub fertile couples and who presented to Al Kasr Al Ainiandrology outpatient clinic for semen analysis between August 2014 and August 2015. And according to Semen parameters groups were divided based on 2010 World Health Organization reference values for semen analysis. The patientgroup were men for whom these semen parameters were all below the reference values. The control group was men for whom these semen parameters were all above the reference values. In urine, Mono butyl phthalate metabolite were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. Correlation of Mono Butyl Phthalate levels in the patients group & semen parameters show significantly higher % of immotile sperms & lower % of progressively motile sperms with higher mono butyl level in urine. Higher levels of Mono Butyl Phthalates has negative impact on semen quality in regard to sperm motility.","El Salam M.H.A., El Zohairy E.A.E.-F., Mohammed M., El Ahwani A.T., Ibrahim A.A.K.",No DOI,"Research Journal Of Pharmaceutical, Biological And Chemical Sciences"
Low Cost Interventions To Improve Outcomes In Newborns,"In 2010, 7.7 million children died ( Lancet) Out of these 3.1 million deaths (40.3%) were newborns. 65% of these deaths occurred in 10 countries, those from the subsaharan Africa, south asia and china. Nearly 40% of these deaths occur within 24 hours of the birth. The causes of most of these deaths are a handful of the conditions, namely perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, prematurity and low birth weight, congenital anomalies. The actual reason behind these are lack of infrastructure in health care, low health care budget, poverty and non affordability. Political lack of vision and prioritizatioin of problems. Even in one country neonatal mortality is lower in rich than in poor regions. Higher in rural areas as compared to urban cities. •Resources dedicated to neonatal health are small in low income countries. Reasons put forward are , neonatal mortality is dependent on development (wealth). The cost of neonatal care is high, high technology, great expertise is needed and this is not uniformly available in low resource countries. Though this may be partially correct, examples like Srilanka, Bangladesh and some of the states in India like Kerala, Goa are clear examples of good performance with the same handicaps as the others. With introduction of low cost interventions,1 million of neonatal lives could be saved in one year. These simple interventions are cost effective and do not need any high tech support or high level expertise. Some of these are during the antenatal period, some in the labour room and many of them in the neonatal care. Effective antenatal care is the basis of good outcome of pregnancy. Nutrition, immunization, surveillance of the mother and fetus are the pillars of good care. Institutional deliveries, delivery by a trained birth attendant , a referral system and good ambulance services are other important aspects. Antenatal steroids for women who are expected to go in for preterm delivery.-. single course of steroids to mother, reduces the incidence of RDS, IVH, NEC. Shortens the stay in hospital, reduces the need for ventilation and oxygen. Magnesium sulphate in preterm labor- given to women at risk of preterm birth, provides neuroprotection to the fetus. Cerebral palsy and motor disabilities reduced by 40%. Delayed umbilical cord clampingimproves the hematocrit of the newborn, reduces IVH, improves immunity. Resuscitation: Trained personnel to provide the same, regulating oxygen at resuscitation and subsequently in the nursery and NICU. Temperature control in the delivery room. Plastic wrap/ plastic bag prevents evaporative heat loss in preterm infants. Hypothermia on its own and combined with other morbidities is a potential killer. Hand washing- has been proved beyond doubt as a substantial reducer of infection, preventing the enormous morbidity that is associated with neonatal sepsis. CPAP vs ventilator - Early CPAP reduces the need for surfactant therapy, prevents morbidities associated with invasive ventilation, early discharge. Breast feeding- within an hour, exclusive until 6 months of age imparts innumerable benefit to mother, baby and the community. Early enteral feeding , preferably with breast milk improves weight gain, provides optimum nutrition, reduces infection and reduces hospital stay . Kangaroo mother care is a marvelous modality, prevents hypothermia, improves breast feeding rates, weight gain and shortens the hospital stay. Antibiotics only when needed, rationale use of antibiotics along with infection control measures is another great boon to reduce neonatal sepsis, nosocomial in addition to avoiding the development of the dangerous situation of antibiotic resistance. These interventions, can be practiced even in small units, easy and cost effective. They should be practiced totally and consistently, do derive the benefit. The outcome will definitively improve and the myth that neonatal care is expensive and not feasible and possible in resource restricted areas will be proved wrong.",Pejaver R.K.,No DOI,Journal Of Perinatal Medicine
Antimicrobial Effects Of Some Herbal Extracts Against Infectious Bacteria Isolated From Burn Wound,"Herbal compounds with antimicrobial effects are of major importance because of increasing antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of Melissa officinalis L, Plantago major L, Orobancha crenata Forsk, Phoenix dactylifera, Ziziphus mauritiana, and Teucrium polium seed extracts on some human pathogenic bacteria isolated from burn wounds. Disk-diffusion antibiotic sensitivity testing, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were applied to assess the antibacterial activity of the extracts in comparison with tetracycline, as a control antibiotic. The extract of the Orobancha crenata showed stonger antibacterial effects than the other herbal extracts on Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Kelebsiela ponomoni. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive one to the Ziziphus mauritiana nucleus extract compared with other herbs. According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that the extracts of some native plants of Iran can be an appropriate alternative to the existing antibiotics, applicable for prevention of burn infections.","Mohammadsadeghi S., Habibi H., Keshavarzi A., Malekpour A.",No DOI,Trends In Pharmaceutical Sciences

Risk Factors Of Emerging Multidrug Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii In Burn Patients At Burn Unit Of Dr. Soetomo Hospital,"INTRODUCTION: Burn injury patients are at high risk of infection as a result of the nature of the burn injury itself, including prolonged hospital stays, antibiotics use, treatment procedures, etc. In this era, nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (A.ba) have increased significantly. This study was conducted to investigate the micro-organism pattern and the risk factors for burn patients with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (A.ba) in the Burn Unit at Dr. Soetomo Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study among burn patients with A.ba admitted to the Burn Unit at Dr. Soetomo Hospital from January 2020 to December 2021. Potential risk factors for MDR-A.ba were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The patients diagnosed with MDR-A.ba wound infection were included in the case group. The patients diagnosed with non MDR, these are: (1) the patients isolated micro-organisms other than A.ba, (2) sterile isolates, and (3) the patients isolated as A.ba but not MDR, were included in the control group. RESULTS: A total of 120 burn patients were included in this study. During this study, 24% burn patients were found to have Acinetobacter baumannii and 79% (from 24% of Acinetobacter baumannii) had MDR-A.ba. According to univariate analysis, risk factors that significant were: Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) (p = 0,002; OR: 6.10; CI: 1,68 - 21,57); hospital Length Of Stay (LOS) (p < 0,000; OR: 6.95; CI: 2,56 - 18,91) and comorbid (p = 0,006; OR: 3,72; CI: 1,44 - 9,58). But, after analysed by multivariate analysis, only ABSI was the significant factor (p = 0,010; OR: 1,70; CI: 1,23 - 2,36). CONCLUSION: Based on univariate analysis, the significant risk factors for MDR-A.ba were: ABSI, hospital length of stay and comorbid. But after adjusted by multivariate analysis, only ABSI was the significant factor.","Primasari M., Budi A.S., Hariani L., Kurniati N.D., Saputro I.D.",No DOI,The Medical Journal Of Malaysia
A Cross Sectional Point Prevalence Survey Of Antimicrobial Consumption In A Tertiary Care Facility,"Aim: A point prevalence survey study (PPS) of antimicrobial consumption in a tertiary care super-speciality hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was carried out in the Department of pharmacology, A. N. Magadh Medical College and Hospital, Gaya, Bihar, India, from November 2019 to August 2020, after taking the approval of the protocol review committee and institutional ethics committee. The study followed the standard guidelines of point prevalence survey (PPS) methodology as described by Global PPS of Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance (version January 2019). Results: A total of 100 patient related data was collected in the designated survey form. Total beds covered were 200 and the number of patients on antimicrobials was found to be low at 20 %. The patients surveyed were predominantly female (80 %). The mean number of antimicrobials per patient was found to be 1.72 (range of 1.5 to 2.3) relatively low numbers of patients were found to be on 2 or more antimicrobials. Double gram negative and double anaerobic coverage of AM used varied across departments covered. Conclusion: The study was not only able to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting point prevalence survey in high patient volume and paper based medical record system but also generated the baseline intervention for evaluating the impact of future interventions.","Kumari A., Singh R.K.",No DOI,International Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Clinical Research
Environmental Factors Associated With Etiology Of Microbiologically Confirmed Reconstructive Breast Implant Infections: Impact On Clinical Management And Treatment,"Even if wide differences exist in the incidence of Gram-negative infections following breast cancer implant reconstructions (2-20%), its occurrence needs to be considered to optimize antibiotic therapy, which is usually directed towards Gram-positive cocci. There is a general notion on the possible source of Gram-negative microorganisms during outdoor activities. For this reason, we administered a specific questionnaire to infected patients to investigate this aspect. In 450 consecutive implant reconstructions between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018, 27 patients (6%) developed proven infection. For each patient, we collected age, tumor stage and recurrence, chemo/radiotherapy, infecting microorganism, fate of implant, type and duration of antibiotic treatment, and administered a questionnaire on exposure to contaminated environments. Twenty patients (74%) had Gram-positive and 7 (26%) had implants infected by Gram-negative agents. The two groups were homogeneous as regards age and no statistically significant difference was observed for other parameters. A significant difference was detected with regard to environmental risk factors in the Gram-negative group (p=0,049). Length of antibiotic therapy was longer in the Gram-negative patients (17.4 vs 11.05 days) and antibiotic treatment was ineffective in 43% of the Gram-negative group. Environmental factors may be an element to evaluate in order to improve patient management. Surveys on larger cohorts are warranted.","Franchelli S., Rossin A., Pesce M., Marchese A., De Maria A.",No DOI,The New Microbiologica
"Recalcitrant Hidradenitis Suppurativa: An Investigation Of Demographics, Surgical Management, Bacterial Isolates, Pharmacologic Intervention, And Patient-Reported Health Outcomes","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is characterized by chronic inflammation, recurrent abscesses, and scarring. Surgery is performed when medical management and antibiotic therapy fails. This study sought to evaluate the demographics, surgical procedures, bacteriology, pharmacologic intervention, and quality of life of patients with recalcitrant HS requiring surgical intervention. A retrospective chart review was performed of 76 recalcitrant HS patients at the University of Illinois Medical Center. Patient demographics, bacterial culture, and surgery data were reviewed. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-item short-form health survey. Patients were mostly female (73.7%) and African American (81.6%) with a mean duration of symptoms of 8.6 years before surgery. Patients underwent at least one surgical procedure, most often to the axillae (57.6%) and 73.7 per cent received antibiotics. The most common culture isolates were Corynebacterium species (14.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%) with varying resistance patterns. Surveyed patients had depressed 36-item short-form health survey physical functioning and social functioning scores. Recalcitrant HS patients with progressive symptomology over approximately nine years before surgical intervention were more likely to be African American women with axillary HS. Quality of life was diminished.We recommend initial treatment of HS with clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in clindamycin refractory cases.","Thomas C., Rodby K.A., Thomas J., Shay E., Antony A.K.",No DOI,American Surgeon
Use Of Antibiotics In Oral Surgery,"The discovery of antibiotics is still considered one of the greatest discoveries in medicine, which changed not only course of numerous infectious diseases but also improved all areas of medicine as well as dental medicine. We witness their importance and benefit every day. However, nowadays there is more and more talk about the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, which has reached alarming proportions. This is supported by the fact that the World Health Organization has included the fight against resistance in it's priorities, and that the Council of Europe has adopted a resolution that aims to control the development and spread of resistance to antibiotics. Precisely for these reasons, it is very important to recognize which conditions require antibiotic therapy and which do not. Also, knowing the most common causes of inflammation of the orofacial area, as well as the clinical signs of this inflammation, we can choose the most suitable antibiotic in the appropriate dose and duration of therapy, and in this way, on the one hand, treat the inflammation, while on the other hand we can prevent the development of resistance. We must be aware of the fact that the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics does not result from the antibiotics themselves, but from their excessive and unjustified use as well as inadequate choice, dose and duration of antibiotic therapy.",Danić P.,No DOI,Acta Stomatologica Croatica
Embracing Life Project: Blending Clinical Cleft Expertise With Education And Research In The Middle East,"Background/Purpose: Over eleven years, we and our partners have performed cleft surgery in the West Bank, and developed a training program for local surgeons. Parallel to this educational model, we have established a clinical database to track surgical outcomes. This program is now being extended to Gaza, Lebanon, and Jordan. Methods/Description: Training program: Our model for surgical training includes identifying trainees from three surgical specialties (Otolaryngology (ENT), Oral Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS), Plastic Surgery (PS) who are willing to participate in twice-a-year volunteer surgical trips (on average 50 cases per trip) in addition to on-going operations between trips with already-trained surgeons. Once the trainee has completed this 3-years training program, he/she is considered an independent surgeon; following an additional year of leadership training, the individual is considered a master surgeon, and is capable of training others. Operating Rooms: Early in our clinical work, we identified access to operating room space as a hurdle to the training process. In response to this need, we have opened a 2-room Cleft and Craniofacial Center in Ramallah, Palestine; and arranged access to Ahli Arabi Hospital in Gaza City, Gaza, to the Rosary Sisters Hospital in Irbid, Jordan, to Hamshari Hospital in Sidon, south Lebanon and to Safad Hospital in north Lebanon. Clinical Outcomes Research: In response to a need to perform longitudinal outcomes studies, in 2011 we developed the Palestinian Congenital Anomalies Database (PCAD), centered on a 700-question survey administered in colloquial Arabic to mothers of children with birth anomalies. Results: Over 11 years, we have trained 5 independent first generation surgeons (3 of whom are OMFS, 1 each in ENT and PS). Three of these 5 surgeons are now considered master surgeons (2 OMFS, 1 PS). We have initiated the training of 5 second generation surgeons (2 each in PS and ENT; one in OMFS). One of these surgeons lives and works in Gaza. We have completed 2750 cases with a single death (8 hours after surgery while on the pediatric ward). We have started the process of identifying trainees in Jordan and Lebanon, and will start the educational program at these sites within a year. PCAD has now collected full survey data on 575 patients. Data on speech outcomes after palate repair for our first generation surgeons are now being utilized as part of our educational program to improve surgical outcomes. Conclusions: A training program in the Middle East to teach cleft care can be designed across national boundaries, to provide high level care for children, on-goingtrainingofnew generationsofsurgeons,inconjunction with a clinical research arm to further improve clinical outcomes.","Van Aalst J., Zaru S., Amr R., Zawahrah H., Ayesh J., Halaby W., Hatab M.A., Jafar N.",No DOI,Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal

Bisphenol A Confers Resistance To Camptothecin Induced Cell Death In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting compound used heavily in the production of consumer products, including plastics, thermal receipt paper, and epoxies. This led to extensive environmental contamination of BPA and continuous human exposure. A number of adverse health effects, including cancer, have been attributed to BPA exposure; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are still unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that BPA co-exposure with an oxidizing agent delayed the onset of DNA damage response and repair, improving cell survival after genotoxic stress. This suppression of DNA repair was not previously examined in other co-exposure studies and may be a potential mechanism by which BPA promote the development or progression of cancer. To better understand the promotion of cell survival by BPA after genotoxic stress, we investigated whether BPA alter cell sensitivity to camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic agent that creates DNA-protein crosslinks. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are sensitive to CPT treatment; however, co-exposure with high dose of BPA showed a significant improvement in cell survival. To determine the mechanism of survival, we evaluated the ability of BPA to alter the induction of CPT-mediated DNA-topoisomerase I (Top1) crosslinks, which induce cell death. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in CPT-induced DNA-protein covalent complexes in cells co-exposed with BPA, despite the fact that BPA treatment, alone or with CPT, increased the protein levels of Top1 in cells. We are currently evaluating potential mechanisms by which BPA could alter Top1 recruitment and binding to DNA.","Sonavane M., Gassman N.R.",No DOI,Environmental And Molecular Mutagenesis

Noma Disease: 10 Years Of Research In The Quest Of A Microbial Etiology,"Introduction: Noma is a devastating ancient illness that causes severe facial disfigurement in >140,000 children every year mainly in Africa, South America and India. The cause of noma remains unknown but infection, oral hygiene and immune status likely all contribute. Objectives: Efforts have been deployed over the 2 past decades to identify microbial agents (fungal, bacterial and viral) responsible for noma. Methods: Research in the field of microbial identification has benefited from dramatic technical improvements. Until the late 90's culture based methods were predominantly used. More recently, culture-independent methods were used to identify bacteria in noma patients. We present three approaches used to study hundreds of gingival samples from noma patients and local control samples collected from villages near Zinder, Niger (Africa): large-scale cloning sequencing methods used at the beginning of 2000, high-density microarrays and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) devices. Results: Culture-based methods identified Fusobacterium necrophorum as the causative agent of noma, while culture-independent methods identify higher levels of Fusobacteriales in healthy controls. Cloning-sequencing strategies identify disequilibrium in microbial communities from noma patients particularly in Fusobacteria, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus genus abundance. This was also detected in studies using semi-quantitative microarrays. More recently, the utilization of HTS provided a detailed analysis of microbial flora in noma patients and identified Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales as indicators of noma. Our epidemiological investigations excluded the possible role of viruses such as cytomegalovirus or morbillivirus as possible significant contributor of noma disease. Conclusion: Although we identify a unique distribution and composition of microbial communities in noma wound sites compared to unaffected samples from the same mouths and healthy controls, the etiology of noma disease remains elusive. Future studies should include longitudinal sampling in high risk areas and detailed exploration of microbiota before and during development of lesions.","Franc¸Ois P., Whiteson K., Baratti Mayer D., Schrenzel J., Pittet D.",No DOI,Antimicrobial Resistance And Infection Control
Frequency And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern Of Microorganisms Isolated From Hospitalized Infantile Burn Cases In A Tertiary Care Hospital,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of organisms and their antimicrobial sensitivity pattern in infantile burn. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the plastic surgery, burn unit of Patel Hospital during period of 7 years from January 2007 to December 2013. Children aged one year or less at the time of admission were included in the study. SPSS 21 version was used for statistical analysis. Results: Total 789 pediatric burn patients were admitted in Patel Hospital during January 2007 to December 2013, in which 106 were infants. Eighty three (78.3%) infants had scald burn, 21 (19.8%) had fire burn and 2 (1.9%) had chemical burn. Out of 106 infantile burn cases, 28 (26.4%) had growth of organisms in wound cultures. Initially at the time of admission only 2 (7%) of infants had growth of organisms in wound cultures but on subsequent cultures the growth of organisms increased. Single organism was isolated in wound cultures of 9 (32.1%) patients, while two organisms were found in 8 (28.6%) and three organisms were found in 11 (39.3%) infants. The commonest organisms present both in scald and fire burn were Staphylococcus aureus 17 (60.7%) followed by Acinetobacter species 14 (50%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13 (46.4%) respectively. If we see the sensitivity pattern, Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid followed by fusidic acid 47%. If we see the culture and sensitivity pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Klebsiella species all were 100% sensitive to polymyxin B. While Providencia species and Proteus species were 100% sensitive to cefoperazone + sulbactam and meropenem. Conclusion: This study high lights that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the common organisms in infantile burn. While vancomycin and polymyxin B are the effective empirical therapy in our setup. Antibiotic resistance due to inappropriate use of drugs is a common finding in our environment and medical staff must be educated regarding the rational use of antibiotics. Wound swabs should be performed in all cases.","Mehdi S.Z., Akber J.U.D., Nizam M., Dawood K., Buksh A.R.",No DOI,Pakistan Paediatric Journal
Antimicrobial Activity Of Starch-Based Biodegradable Antimicrobial Films Incorporated With Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles Against Multiple Drug-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Food Isolates,"This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of starch-based biodegradable antimicrobial films incorporated with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) against multiple drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus food isolates. Herein, the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of Origanum marjorana (OM) leaf extract, OM essential oil, OM nano-emulsion, chemically synthesized Ag-NPs (chem-Ag-NPs), and OM-based biosynthesized Ag-NPs (bio-Ag-NPs) using OM extracts were determined against a cocktail of three pathogenic Staphylococcus (S.) aureus strains isolated from meat products, using the agar well diffusion assay (AWDA). Afterward, homemade starch-based biodegradable antimicrobial films (SBAF) were incorporated with the suitable antimicrobials, based on AWDA and preliminary experiments, and investigated for their an-timicrobial properties against S. aureus cocktail through the disc diffusion assay (DDA). The obtained results showed that in WDA, bio-Ag-NPs (1mM) had a significantly higher antimicrobial activity than chem-Ag-NPs (1mM), with inhibition zones accounting for 23 and 19mm, respectively. Whereas both types of nanoparticles were significantly more potent in their antimicrobial properties than different concentrations of OM extract, essential oil, and nano-emulsion (p<0.05). In concern to SBAF incorporated with antimicrobials, SBAF incorporated with chem-Ag-NPs (SBAF/chem-Ag-NPs) showed a significantly stronger antimicrobial effect than SBAF incorporated with bio-Ag-NPs (SBAF/bio-Ag-NPs) in the DDA, while both types of films produced significantly larger zones of inhibition than other antimicrobials (p<0.05). These homemade biodegradable films incorporated with bio-Ag-NPs could be a good alternative to petroleum-based packaging (plastic) in food packaging applications and meanwhile improve food safety and quality. Further studies investigating the effectiveness of these films on bacterial isolates inoculated in real food samples are suggested.","Ahmed O.A.M., Khalafalla F.A., Ali F.H.M., Hassan A.H.A.",No DOI,Journal Of Advanced Veterinary Research
Analysis Of Skin Graft For Bacterial Infection In A Tertiary Health Care Centre,"An intact human skin surface is vital to the preservation of bodily fluid homeostasis, thermoregulation, and the host's protection against infection. Any breach in the skin will lead to compromise in health and well-being of the patient, successful skin grafting is the key to patient survival. But most of the times transplant recipients are predisposed to wide variety of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections because of immunosuppressant's administration there by prolonging the duration of wound healing. Our objective is to analyze the periodic bacterial infection that occurs in skin graft patients and to evaluate anti-microbial susceptibility testing on the bacteria isolated from the skin graft infection. 300 swabs from 50 skin graft cases were collected from the patients admitted in plastic surgery unit of S.S. Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Davangere. Periodic swabs were taken on Day 0, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 and week 5. The isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done as per CLSI guidelines. Detection of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESβL), Metallo-β-lactamase (MβL) and Amp C-type β-lactamase were done according to standard guidelines. The tissue defects were grouped according to the cause as follows: vascular ulcers (9.2%), burns (14.5%), traumatic tissue defects (36.6%), and flap donor-site defects (39.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 38.9% of the cases followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae in 25.9% cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 18.5% of cases. Other organisms isolated are E.coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, CoNS, Acinetobacter baumannii. In all the cases, the preoperative evaluation indicated an adequate wound-bed preparation. However, graft loss secondary to infection was recorded in 12 patients (24%) and more common in grafts applied to the lower extremities ulcers in case of diabetic foot or when performed at multiple sites in case of burn infections. All the isolates were multi drug resistant. Among Gram negative bacteria, 17.9% were ESβL, 7.7% were AmpC and 21.6% were MβL producers. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant ESβL and MβL producer. 40% of the isolates were MRSA producers as skin transplant infection being a major problem, it becomes important to detect the specific pattern of graft microbial colonization and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles so to reduce graft rejection.","Vinodkumar C.S., Hegde S.V., Mayuri K.S., Bandekar N., Chethan Kumar S., Basavarajappa K.G.",No DOI,International Journal Of Pharma And Bio Sciences
Introducing A New Device To Measure Femoral Canal Length In Reconstructive Surgery Of Cruciate Ligament Of Knee,"Background and purpose: Locating and measuring the length of the distal femoral canal is a very important stage in reconstructive surgery of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament rupture in knee. Sometimes it is difficult or impossible to measure it in some patients. To resolve this problem, a measuring tool called the Measuring Instrument of the Length of the Femoral Canal (Satkr) was designed and registered in Iranian patent office. The instrument was designed to measure the length of the femoral canal before creating any canal in distal femur (therefore, enabling surgeons to change it if it was not calculated properly). Materials and methods: In this comparative cross sectional study, a part from Satkr, two other instruments which are commonly used in reconstructive surgery of knee ligaments including a 4.5 graded Reamer and a depth gauge that is the final confirming tool for measuring the length of the canal were applied to 50 patients of both sexes. According to the operating techniques, measures of the length of the canal were separately written and statistical differences were recorded in two-sided way. Results: Data indicated significant differences between the scores of Reimer, depth gauge and Satkr (P=0.004). Conclusion: According to this study, Satkr had significantly less errors compared to Reamer. Thus, it can be claimed that the measurements obtained by Satkr are more precise than measurements obtained by other measuring tools.","Dehghanirad P., Nayersabeti S.P., Mirbolook A., Asadi K., Sheykhi A., Davoodi L., Moaydahmadi B., Moayedahmadi B., Mousavi M.",No DOI,Journal Of Mazandaran University Of Medical Sciences

Plastic Antibodies For Virus Detection- Vlp Model,"Viral detection is a rapidly growing field owing to its increasing prevalence and ongoing evolution of viral variants and drug resistance. Molecular imprinting technology, made possible to produce tailormade artificial receptors, also called plastic antibodies. The molecular imprinting process involves three main steps: self-assembly of template with functional monomer molecules, polymerization of tem plate-monomer complex, and template removal. The last step enables the unveiling of the binding cavities that are specific to the imprinted molecule and allows its rebinding. In this under development work, we use Qβ VLP's, which mimic viral particles, with dopamine as monomeric structures to make the imprinting sites on commercially available carbon screen printed electrodes (SPE). Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and fitting the Nyquist plots with a Randall's circuit, it is possible to follow and quantify (Ω) the modifications on SPEs. VLP's are embedded into a 0.5mM dopamine monomeric solution and polymerization is electrochemically induced. The removal step is being optimized using a 0.6M Urea solution. Vlp's template rebinding step promotes surface charge differentiation that is seen in the impedance spectra at VLP concentration of 100pg/mL. Although sensor has shown sensitivity, sensor assembly still requires optimization due to unspecific adsorption of VLp's in the polymeric matrix. Overall, this is a re-emerging technology now made possible due electronics advance. Measurements can be performed in situ with hight accuracy and giving immediate results.","Costa J., Sales G., Voguel M., Bachmann M.",No DOI,Swiss Medical Weekly
Immune Modulation Of Macrophage Polarization Alleviates The Immunopathogenesis That Occurs During Pulmonary Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Rationale: The fungicidal immune response during Pneumocystis pneumonia depends on the adaptive immune cells; however macrophages act as one of the major effector cells in the lung. They are broadly classified as M1-polarized macrophages with fungicidal properties and alternatively activated M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory function. The aim of this study is to investigate the immune responses induced by macrophages and the implications of macrophage polarization in the immunotherapeutic intervention of Pneumocystis pneumonia Methods: We used a rat model of pulmonary Pneumocystis infection. At selected times, groups of animals were sacrificed and tissues harvested for: histology to assess the inflammation by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, flow-cytometry to check the leukocyte profile, real-time PCR and western blot analyses to compare the gene expression patterns of M1 and M2 marker genes. The Pneumocystis carinii (Pc) burden was quantified by real-time PCR using primers amplifying its large mitochondrial subunit. Similar analyses were performed in vitro using bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages in the presence and absence of IFN and IL4 as secondary stimuli after Pc infection. Results: Firstly, we evaluated the kinetics and found a steady increase in the ratio of iNOS (M1) to Arg-1 (M2) levels illustrating an in vivo pulmonary M1 macrophage polarization status upon Pc infection. This correlated with the increase in inflammation and an increase in the recruitment of alveolar macrophages to the Pc-infected lungs. To show that M1 polarization of macrophages upon Pc infection is a phenomenon intrinsic to macrophages and is not influenced by other cell types, we tested and confirmed the increase in M1 macrophage response using rat bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages in vitro. Next, we tested whether the polarity of the Pc-stimulated and M1-polarized macrophages can be reversed by an alternative cytokine stimulus. Interestingly, we observed an overall reversal in the polarity of Pc-stimulated macrophages to that of a M2 at both the mRNA and protein levels upon secondary stimulation with IL4. Conclusion: Collectively, these data indicate that macrophages differentiate to that of a M1-phenotype both in vitro and in vivo upon Pc infection. By utilizing the plastic nature of macrophages, we further demonstrated that the M1 response induced by Pc infection could be reversed given alternative stimulus. Currently, we are investigating whether adoptive transfer of in vitro-polarized M2 macrophages in a rat model of Pneumocystis pneumonia may serve as potential cellular immunotherapy in the alleviation of excessive inflammatory responses caused during Pneumocystis pneumonia.","Nandakumar V., Hebrink D., Jenson P., Limper A.H.",No DOI,American Journal Of Respiratory And Critical Care Medicine
Endoscopic Treatment In Painful Chronic Pancreatitis,"The goal of endoscopic treatment is to drain the pancreatic duct, reduce the frequency and severity of pain and resolve local complications of the disease. Pain is the main symptom in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The endoscopic treatment is minimally invasive and it can be successfully repeated in cases of pain relapses, which are resistant to common analgesics. The endoscopic treatment combines several procedures, to restore drainage of the main pancreatic duct: pancreatic sphincterotomy, extraction of pancreatic stones, pancreatic and biliary stenting, the drainage of pseudocysts with conventional endoscopy or with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Ductal stone clearance can be a very challenging procedure, depending on the stones location, size, consistency and presence of the associated ductal strictures. The stricture dilation, intraductal lithotripsy and major/minor papilla sphincterotomy may be helpful in some cases. In non-cephalic large stones (> 5 mm), extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) alone or in combination with the endoscopic treatment is recommended. Single or simultaneous, multiple, side-by-side plastic pancreatic duct stents are effective for the management of pancreatic strictures, duct leaks, and disruptions. Several studies have showed the efficiency of pancreatic metallic stents, but unfortunately with a short-time follow-up. The endotherapy efficacy is comparable with surgery, with a higher success rate in properly selected patients and with a low morbidity. It can be repeated and performed independently regardless of the patient's age. In some cases, it may be considered as a “bridge” to subsequent surgery. Several studies have compared the short-term and long-term outcomes of surgical treatment vs. endoscopic treatment in patients with chronic pancreatitis [1]. Some studies showed the long-term results of surgical treatment are better than endoscopic treatment in patients with dilated pancreatic duct, stones or strictures [2]. The success of endotherapy in biliary drainage in chronic pancreatitis (CP) is poor in most of the published series, with a 10-33% rate of stricture resolution. The choice between endoscopic and surgical drainage should be taken according to medical center expertise, patient co-morbidities and compliance to repeat endoscopic procedures. Multiple simultaneous plastic stents have had better results comparing with single biliary plastic stenting. Recent data shows good results using covered expandable metal stents. In our experience, biliary drainage was successful in 74.29% of patients during a median follow-up period of 15 months. Surgery remains the option for treatment if endoscopic treatment is not successful, in patients with high surgical risk or a suspect pancreatic inflammatory mass. The management of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis is a therapeutical challenge and must be approached via an interdisciplinary collaboration team. The initial approach should be minimal endoscopic treatment. Due to the increased risk of complications and higher costs, additional endoscopic treatment and surgical intervention should be reserved for cases which have no response to the minimal endoscopic treatment.","Tantau M., Mandrutiu A., Tantau A.",No DOI,Journal Of Gastrointestinal And Liver Diseases
Effects Of Silver Sulfadiazine On Biofilm Formed By Staphylococcus Aureus,"Aim: Biofilms are formed on indwelling medical devices and wounds, by which bacteria acquire an augmented tolerance against antibiotics. No effective drugs for biofilm are so far available. In the present study, we examined the effects of silver sulfadiazine (AgSD) on biofilm formed by methicillin-resistant Staphylo-coccus aureus (MRSA). Method: Clinically isolated MRSA was used. Biofilm was settled on a plastic by incubating bacteria at 37 8C for 18 hours (BF18H) and 36 hours (BF36H), respectively. Effects of AgSD (0-1,120 lM) on biofilm were estimated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC). In some studies, AgNO$inf$3$/inf$ and SD were also used. Results: No difference in MIC (35 lM) was found among planktonic bacteria, BF18H and BF36H. MBC increased to 70 lM, 140 lM, and 140 lM, respectively. MBEC was 140 lM for BF18H and 280 lM for BF36H. Similar assay was performed using AgNO$inf$3$/inf$ and SD. In case of AgNO$inf$3$/inf$, MIC535 lM, MBC5280 lM, and MBEC >1,120 lM. Whereas, SD induced >1120lM for all of the analysis. Ag oxidations change the color to black. When biofilm was incubated with AgSD and AgNO$inf$3$/inf$, blackish products were largely accumulated only in the AgSD culture. Conclusions: AgSD is widely used for infected wounds. However, its effects on biofilm is still unknown. Present study clearly showed that AgSD is an effective drug to disrupt biofilm tolerant capacity of MRSA.","Tan J., Jimi S., Tajiri T., Shigemori K., Hara S., Ohjimi H.",No DOI,Wound Repair And Regeneration
Ultrathin Coatings Of Extracellular Matrix-Mimetic Peptide Hydrogels For Controlled Cell Adhesion And Tissue Formation,"We have studied synthesis and properties of ultrathin hydrogel coatings with a synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) analogue: a chimeric peptide comprising a collagen-like peptide block Cys-Gly-(Pro-Lys-Gly)4 (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4 (Asp-Hyp-Gly)4- and the fibronectin RGD block -Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Gly (hereafter CLP-RGD) [1]. For ultrathin hydrogel functionalized with the peptide, we employed initiator free, UV-controlled self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization reaction, on two different substrates: on glass [2] and medical grade PMMA plastic. In first step, the CLP-RGD peptide was functionalized via Michael addition reaction with methacrylate group using the 3-(acryloyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate reagent, thus obtaining a meathacrylate(MA)-Cys-CLP-RGD functional peptide. By combining MA-Cys-CLPRGD, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, PEG methacrylate and methacrylic acid monomers in selfinitiated photografting and photopolymerization reaction we successfully synthesised 15-50 nm thick, mechanically stable ECM-mimetic peptide hydrogels. The hydrogel coatings were seeded with human skin fibroblast and human cornea epithelium cell lines, respectively. Both cell types formed monolayers on the hydrogel within 96 hours. Our study shows the potential of the fully synthetic ECM-like coatings for bioanalytical, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine application, especially applicable in the high throughput and biochip formats.","Cepla V., Mazetyte-Godiene A., Rakickas T., Jelinskas T., Valiokas R.",No DOI,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Antimicrobial Peptide Treatment To Prevent Aberrant Scarring In Mrsa Infected Wounds,"MRSA infections are associated with delayed wound healing and aberrant scarring in burn patients. Therefore, it is important to eradicate these bacteria. However, the treatment of such infections has become a challenging task due to antibiotic-resistance. Additionally, current topical creams hamper the wound healing. Therefore, we have studied the potential of a new synthetic antimicrobial peptide P148 in terms of safety and efficacy against MRSA. 105 CFU/ml MRSA were exposed to increasing concentrations of P148 (0 to 0.3 mM) in PBS, human plasma or burn eschar extract to mimic the wound environment. After incubation for 30 minutes, the surviving bacterial numbers were determined. The efficacy of P148 was determined in ex vivo models: excisional or burn wound models, tape-stripped, and intact skin. These models were contaminated with 105 CFU/ml MRSA for 1 hour. After treatment with 20 μl 3mM P148 for 1 hour, the surviving bacterial numbers were determined. For safety, the effect of P148 on the re-epithelialization was assessed in burn wound models by measuring the outgrowth and the number of proliferating keratinocytes. We compared P148 to two standard treatments; silver sulfadiazine and bactroban. The required concentration of P148, to eradicate 50% of MRSA (IC50) in PBS was 6.3 × 10(-4) mM, while in plasma and eschar extract the IC50 was 2 × 10(-2) mM and 3.2 × 10(-2) mM, respectively. P148 significantly reduced the bacterial load in all four ex vivo wound models. P148 was slightly more effective on tape-stripped skin and less effective in the excision wound model. Contrary to silver sulfadiazine and bactroban, P148 did not affect the re-epithelialization. P148 was more effective in PBS than in plasma or eschar extract. P148 effectively eradicated MRSA in different wound types and did not interfere with reepithelialization. Taken together, P148 has high potential as an alternative treatment against MRSA.","Dijksteel G.S., Boekema B.K.H.L., Ulrich M.M.W., Middelkoop E.",No DOI,Wound Repair And Regeneration

Increase In Methicilin-Susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus With Reduced Susceptibility To Triclosan Over The Last 20 Years,"Objective: Triclosan as an antibacterial agent in consumer products, such as soaps, deodorants, toothpastes, plastics, and fabrics, has been used widely over the last 20 years. Triclosan targets the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Triclosan is effective in inhibiting growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms including S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Widespread use of triclosan has the potential to lead to alterations in FabI resulting in increased triclosan MICs. We previously showed a significant increase in the proportion of clinical methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with elevated triclosan MICs (MICs ≥1 mg/L) isolated from 2004-2005 compared to 1993-1997. This study was completed to determine if triclosan MICs have continued to rise. Methods: 308 MSSA and 342 MRSA from 2012-2014 MSSA and MRSA isolates were randomly selected from a Toronto-area clinical laboratory's archived sterile and non-sterile site isolates. Triclosan MICs were determined by agar dilution (AD) following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results were compared to AD MIC results of the sterile and non-sterile 397 MSSA and 315 MRSA from 1993-1997 which had been randomly selected from archived isolates collected from Ontario laboratories as part of surveillance programs; and to AD MIC results of the sterile and non-sterile 436 MSSA and 362 MRSA from 2004- 2005 which were randomly selected from clinical isolates. Results: The proportion of MSSA with triclosan MICs ≥1 mg/L rose from 0.2% to 4.6% to 9.1% in 1993-1997, 2005-2006, and 2012-2014, respectively (P<0.0001, X(2) test for trend). There was no significant trend in the proportion of MRSA with triclosan MICs ≥1 mg/L [1.9%, 5.2%, and 0.29% in 1993- 1997, 2005-2006, and 2012-2014, respectively (P=0.1590, X(2) test for trend)]. Results were comparable for sterile and non-sterile isolates. Conclusions: The proportion of MSSA with triclosan MICs mg/L rose significantly from 0.2% to 9.1% over the last 20 years from sterile and non-sterile sites. The lack of a similar trend in MRSA, the associated mechanisms of triclosan resistance, and the possible impact on MICs to novel drugs targeting fabI should be further investigated. .1.","Kissoon M., Ramdass T., Seyed Salehi M., Khan A., Frame B., Willey B.M., Low D.E., Poutanen S.M.",No DOI,Canadian Journal Of Infectious Diseases And Medical Microbiology

Smart Dressings-Beyond The Ideal,"Advancing diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic wounds is still of highest importance. Complex acute and chronic wounds are prone to infections and wound healing disorders, which emphasizes the importance of their early detection and efficient interventions. More effective drug delivery would be one possibility of increasing the treatment-efficiency. We aimed to further improve the advanced nanocellulose-based wound dressings and link them to diagnostic and therapeutic features, which are loading of the dressing with the antiseptic polyhexanide (PHMB) and covalent binding to a pH indicator. Since microbial resistances to antibiotics are multiplying, we investigated a clinically relevant way of easily creating a Drug Delivery Dressing (DDD). The loading of wound dressings with PHMB-containing antiseptics was achieved by letting them soak in the antiseptics. The bacterial growth inhibiting PHMBconcentration of 0.001 %, that has been proven by former studies, could be equalized and detected in a treated wound dressing after less than 30 minutes. To bridge the gap between diagnostic assessment and wound dressings, we performed the linking of a pH-indicator dye to said dressing. Several studies have shown a correlation between the pH value in a (burn) wound and successful wound healing. A multitude of devices to monitor pH is available, all requiring direct wound contact and removal of the dressing for pH monitoring. By the successful covalent binding of a pH indicator dye to a nanocellulose-based dressing, we were able to show the possibility of pH monitoring by the dressing itself in the relevant range (pH 7-10). Our results show that nanocellulose-based dressings are a suitable carrier medium for other substances. Further preclinical and clinical testing will be necessary prior to clinical implementation. Drug-Delivery-and Smart Dressings will play a significant role in the future of wound care to reduce the socioeconomic burden, and improve medical outcome. Summary: In this presentation, we would like to demonstrate possibilities of improving already advanced wound dressings with diagnostic and therapeutic ""upgrades"" to create smart and drug delivery dressings and further advance wound care beyond the ideal.","Nischwitz S.P., Holzer J.C., Hofmann E., Luze H., Bernardelli De Mattos I., Funk M., Mohr G.J., Kotzbeck P., Kamolz L.-P.",No DOI,Wound Repair And Regeneration
Monitoring Metastatic Melanoma Treatment Resistance Using Circulating Tumour Dna,"Background: Metastatic melanoma is an advanced skin cancer with a life expectancy of 2-7 months. Although patients may initially respond to novel molecular therapies, patients inevitably relapse due to the emergence of drug resistance. Non-invasive methods to monitor treatment response and resistance are needed, which may facilitate personalised treatment decisions. Short DNA fragments are continuously released by cancer cells into the bloodstream, termed as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA levels have been shown to reflect tumour burden at the time of sampling. Here, ctDNA analysis was carried out to monitor for treatment resistance on a molecular level via serial blood tests. Materials and Methods: Tumour and plasma samples were collected from AJCC Stage III or IV melanoma patients enroled on MelResist, a translational, multi-centre research study. Exome sequencing was carried out on melanoma tumour samples at baseline and disease progression. Variants identified by exome sequencing were used to design patient-specific panels for Tagged- Amplicon sequencing (TAm-seq). TAm-seq was carried out on serial plasma DNA samples, enabling the longitudinal monitoring of multiple mutations. Results: To date, 72 patients have been recruited. Individualised Tam-Seq panels were run on plasma from 8 patients, tracking ∼50 mutations per patient. Using this approach, tumour dynamics across multiple mutations were monitored, providing insight into the processes underlying the emergence of treatment resistance. ctDNA dynamics correlate with clinical progression data, and precede LDH increases in a number of cases. Conclusion: Monitoring multiple mutations per patient in ctDNA may provide insight into clonal evolution during treatment, and may have utility for identifying treatment resistance earlier than conventional markers.","Murphy S., Wan J., Gale D., Morris J., Mouliere F., Bignell G., Alifrangis C., Parkinson C., Durrani A., Mcdermott U., Massie C., Corrie P., Rosenfeld N.",No DOI,European Journal Of Cancer
Assessment Of The Anti-Tumor Activity Of Leech (Huridinaria Manillensis) Saliva Extract In Prostate Cancer,"Background: Ancient traditional physicians from many countries used leeching to treat a wide range of diseases for thousands of years. Leech saliva contains a large number of peptides and proteins, which have anti-thrombotic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities. Currently, leech therapy has an established role as an important tool in microsurgery, reconstructive surgery and salvage of grafted tissues. Methods: LSE IC50 was determined in-vitro in five prostate cancer cell lines using MTS cell viability assay. In-vivo-efficacy of LSE was determined in LNCaP and 22RV-1 in nude mice xenograft models. Castrated tumor bearing mice were divided into four groups of 6-8 each. Mice were subcutaneously injected with either LSE (5 mg/kg) once a week, LSE (5 mg/kg) twice a week, docetaxel (10 mg/kg) or vehicle twice a week for four weeks. PSA, tumor volume, and weight were measured periodically. Results: Invitro, LSE induced cell death in a panel of five prostate cancer cell lines. In vivo studies showed that LSE once and twice weekly regimens both caused significant decrease in PSA and tumor volume compared to control with no significant difference from docetaxel treated group. Interestingly, once weekly treatment was associated with significant weight gain (due to good dietary intake) at several time points. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) showed significant decrease in P21-and Ki-67 expression in the LSE treated mice compared to the control group in the LNCaP model. Active caspase3 was increased at once and twice weekly doses in both models confirming the proapoptotic properties of LSE. Transcriptome analysis of tumor samples showed that LSE had significant immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, along with significant effects on cell-cell adhesion, induction of glutathione transferase, inhibition of certain growth factors, and modulating several transcription factors. Conclusions: LSE has significant in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity with no apparent side effects. This can be attributed, at least partly, to its ability to inhibit cellular proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest cell cycle through its modulation of immunity, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation.","Hessein M., Ammar A., Chin M., Abdualkader A., Alaama M., Merzouk A., Helaluddin A.B., Ghawi A., Kucuk O., Guns E.",No DOI,Journal Of Clinical Oncology

Bacterial And Mycological Study In Burn Patients Admitted In Gauhati Medical College And Hospital,"Background: Burn wound infection is a major public health problem and globally the most devastating form of trauma. It delays healing, causes scarring and may result in bacteraemia, sepsis or multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Materials and Methods: The present study was a hospital based prospective observational study on 120 burn patients admitted to the Burn ICU. The wound swabs collected from the included patients were Gram stained & bacterial and fungal culture and sensitivity was done. Results: Out of the total 120 patients, highest 41(34.16%) belonged to the 21-30 years age bracket. Preponderance of males 62(51.66%) was more than females 58(48.33%). Flame burn was found to be the commonest form of burn injury (66.7%). Bacterial culture was positive in 104 (87%) of cases, while in 12(10%) cases fungus was isolated. 154 bacterial isolates were isolated, 131 (85%) were Gram negative while rest 23(15%) were Gram positive. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacteria isolated from 60 (39%) samples followed by Klebsiella species 28(18%) samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=60) was mostly susceptible to Imipenem (75%) followed by Gentamicin and Tigecycline with 70% and 50% respectively. Gram positive bacterial isolates (n=23) were found to be most susceptible to Vancomycin 23(100%) and Linezolid 18(100%). Conclusion: The findings of the present study revealed that Gram negative bacilli are still predominant pathogens infecting the burn wounds in this region. Effective strict isolation techniques and infection control are thus needed to decrease the occurrence of burn wound infection.","Miranda K., Chimanjita P., Rekha D.S., Singh R.J.",No DOI,International Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Clinical Research
Role Of Mir-223 In Skin Wound Healing,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs comprising approximately 20- 25 nucleotides of single-stranded RNA, regulate translational processing of target mRNAs. To clarify the function of miR-223 in skin wound healing, we analyzed miR-223 KO mice. Healing of skin wounds in miR-223 KO mice was delayed compared with healing in WT mice. To identify molecular mechanisms of miR-223 associated with skin wound healing, we conducted in vitro and in vivo live imaging analyses, which revealed that miR-223-deficient neutrophils exhibit an increase in hyperoxidative bursts and that miR-223 KO mice undergo prolonged acute inflammatory responses at wound sites. These results suggest that miR-223 regulates neutrophil activation and that it is necessary for the resolution of acute inflammatory responses. In the clinical setting of skin wound healing, Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus are pathogens that are commonly involved in the exacerbation of chronic wounds. It is particularly interesting that S. aureus- infected miR-223 KO mice demonstrated markedly faster skin wound healing than S. aureus-infected WT mice healing. We infer that miR-223-deficient neutrophils are useful for cell transplantation therapy for bacteria-infected chronic skin wounds.","Mori R., Tanaka K., Nozaki T.",No DOI,Wound Repair And Regeneration

Polyester Resin Based Corrosion Casting: Experimental Mechanical Characterization Of Rigid And Flexible Polymers For Anatomical Purposes,"Gross Anatomy learning requires Three Dimensional (3D) structural visualization in order to facilitate spatial relation and structural organization understanding. This educational process - when related to the use of cadavers - has been limited due to the difficulties in acquiring specimens and their reduced shelf life. Synthetic models offer a solution to said issues, in spite of not showing possible anatomical variations. Multiple anatomical techniques have been developed to diminish preservation drawbacks. Among these, polymer corrosion casting (CC) permits the repletion of multiple ducts of an organ, later on, corroded by acid or alkali solutions. Polyester, Epoxy and Acrylic resins are the most widely used rigid polymers for CC due to their polymerized characteristics. This technique has been widely used for education but the final polymeric matrix exhibit several disadvantages like use-related deterioration due to fragility. However, the mechanical characteristics of the polymers have not been described when casted under an Anatomy Laboratory protocol and not using industrial processes. Our aim was to determine the mechanical characteristics of a rigid polyester resin (RPR) as used for CC and to compare them when using a flexible polyester resin (FPR) as an additive or the FPR by itself. FPR was used to aggregate plastic properties to the RPR, in concentrations of 10% and 20% Weight/Weight (W/W). Multiple standard tests were carried out to characterize the resins mechanically. Tensile and three-point bending tests were performed with an Instron Machine 3367, and impact tests with a 43-1TMI impact tester. Each test followed the ASTM standard methods D790, D689 and D256 respectively. Mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity (Young Modulus), maximum strength and ultimate strength were obtained from tension tests. Flexural modulus, maximum flexural strength, maximum deflection and maximum flexural strain were obtained by three-point bending tests while impact energy was acquired from Impact tests. Polymer behavior showed a remarkable correlation to FPR concentration when used as an additive for RPR, increasing significantly the plastic properties of the polymer. Under tension, the major Modulus of Elasticity (1,28 ? 0,40 GPa) was visible at low FPR ratios, in contrast with the FPR alone which presented an average of 16,98 ? 1,24 MPa. This tendency is supported by the elongation at rupture results which increased significantly from 3,20 ? 2,59% for 10% FPR/RPR to 107,19 ? 13,6% for FPR alone. On the other hand, three-point bending exhibited a similar correlation reducing the flexural modulus by 1.87 times and the maximum flexural strength 2.04 times. Impact test allows to corroborate that FPR at 10% is more fragile than FPR alone with an Impact energy of 0,062 ? 0,006 and 1,32 ? 0,24 J/cm respectively. In comparison, RPR alone results presented a Modulus of Elasticity of 1,11 ? 0,14 GPa, an elongation at rupture of 4,73 ? 1,43%, a flexural modulus of 2,35 ? 0,37 GPa, a maximum flexural strength of 74,15 ? 17,49 MPa and an impact energy of 0,055 ? 0,005 J/cm. Our results not only demonstrate that using additives to aggregate plastic properties to a RPR increase its mechanical resistance to rupture but also provides important information about the mechanical properties of RPR and FPR at the time of selecting a polymeric polyester-based formulation to preserve any specimen through CC.","Rueda-Esteban R.J., Lopez-Mccormick J.S., Vargas J.G., Bigio D., Briceño J.C.",No DOI,Faseb Journal
Inhibition Of Autophagy Results In A Reversal Of Taxol Resistance In Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma By Enhancing Taxol-Induced Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis,"Drug resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains a major obstacle of clinical therapy. We found that the taxol-resistant cells demonstrated higher basal levels of autophagy than parental cells, which could be inhibited by 3-MA and Beclin-1-siRNA. We further revealed that inhibition of autophagy enhanced taxol-induced caspasedependent apoptosis, resulted in partial reversal of the acquired taxol resistance in taxol-resistant cells. Our results suggest that the combination of an autophagy inhibitor with taxol may be a promising approach to promote therapeutic efficacy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Song Y., Li W., Peng X., Xie J., Li H., Tan G.",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
Mycobacterium Abscessus Infection Following Cosmetic Surgery In The Dominican Republic,"Learning Objective #1: Identify the unique challenges involved in diagnosis and management of patients who are medical tourists Learning Objective #2: Discuss the clinical manifestations of infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) CASE: This case regards a 36-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with pain in her lower abdomen where two weeks prior she had undergone abdominoplasty and liposuction in the Dominican Republic. On initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile and tachycardic to the low 100s with otherwise stable vitals. Physical exam and laboratory findings were grossly within normal limits. A CT of the abdomen revealed skin induration and thickening thought to be consistent with acute post-surgical changes and the patient was discharged. Over the following month, the patient had outpatient encounters with both a plastic surgeon and her primary care provider and was also seen in the ED on two more occasions. Despite continued pain, infection was not suspected. Finally, 6 weeks following surgery, worsening discomfort prompted the patient to again present to the ED where she was found with low-grade fever. When repeat CT demonstrated multiple abscesses in the ventral abdominal wall, the patient was admitted, underwent IR-guided drainage of the abdominal wounds and was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. When culture results returned with Mycobacterium abscessus, the patient was started on clarithromycin, amikacin and cefoxitin with improve-ment in her symptoms with a total planned course of 6 months duration. IMPACT: Though M. abscessus is a rare cause of human infection, its ability to form biofilms along with intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics has implicated it in contamination of both surgical equipment and pharmaceutical supplies leading to postsurgical infections. While domestic infections with M. abscessus remain rare, the rise of medical tourism among patients in the US who travel abroad for procedures has come a corresponding rise in M. abscessus infections, especially among medical tourists receiving cosmetic surgery. This trend presents an important public health problem with associated challenges in both diagnosis and adequate treatment. DISCUSSION: This case raises many of the issues that come to light for physicians and public health agencies when caring for medical tourists, from the lack of clear instructions for follow up or removal to the role of otherwise uncommon infectious etiologies in this patient population. As in this patient's case, the presentation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria can be subtle and insidious. Additionally, gram staining and standard cultures are not sensitive for this pathogen, and most clinical microbiology laboratories are not equipped to distinguish between subspecies or to conduct sensitivity testing, all of which factors make diagnosis and timely treatment difficult. Accordingly, more comprehensive reporting of cases like this is an important objective.",O'Neill E.P.,No DOI,Journal Of General Internal Medicine
Local Treatment Of Skin Ulcers In Collagen Disease And Vasculitis: Our Treatment Strategies,"Collagen disease and vasculitis are systemic conditions involving an autoimmune mechanism. For this reason, skin ulcers accompanying these diseases are treated systemically by targeting the primary disease. With this in mind, we attempted local treatment according to the following strategies. As long as there were no infectious symptoms that might cause delays in the healing process, we used Vaseline, the base of topical agents without any active ingredient, and nonadhesive absorption pads as wound dressings. If infectious symptoms were present, then ointments containing iodine were used instead. If these topical materials did not achieve an adequate therapeutic effect, then topical agents containing bFGF formulations, and so-called modern wound dressings were used. If the wound did not improve with these methods, then the use of skin grafts was taken into consideration. By performing skin grafts, not only does the size of the ulcer shrink by the size of the take area, but due to bioactive substances released by the skin graft, wound healing accelerates as well. In these diseases, joint deformities are also common. With foot ulcers, care should also be taken to minimize the mechanical stress caused by footwear. There are foot ulcers resistant to the treatment described above due to macroangiopathy, microangiopathy and connective tissue dysfunction. Therefore, the only option is to employ all existing treatment methods such as cultured keratinocytes and platelet rich plasma in these cases. Unfortunately, some cases will develop gangrene of the leg, resulting in sepsis which would require major amputation.","Matsuzaki K., Okabe K., Aramaki-Hattori N., Kishi K.",No DOI,Wound Repair And Regeneration
Platelet Metabolism In Clopidogrel Resistant And Sensitive Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease,"OBJECTIVE: to investigate relationship between activity of platelet nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) dependent dehydrogenases in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and their sensitivity to clopidogrel.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 51 male patients with chronic IHD before and after CABG. Control group comprised 35 healthy men. In IHD patients spontaneous and induced platelet aggregation was measured by aggregometry before CABG (in 2 weeks after cessation of antiplatelet drugs), after CABG during therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg/day), and in 6 months after surgery. Patients were classified as clopidogrel sensitive or resistant using cutoff of 50% inhibition of initial ADP (5 M) induced platelet aggregation after 2 weeks of treatment with clopidogrel. Activity of platelet NAD and NADP dependent dehydrogenases was measured by bioluminescent method.RESULTS: There were 41 clopidogrel sensitive and 10 clopidogrel resistant patients. Irrespective of sensitivity to clopidogrel platelet metabolism in IHD patients was characterized by reduced activity of anaerobic energetics, glutathione-dependent antioxidant system, reactions that transport products of lipid catabolism on glycolysis, and NADPH-dependent transfer of substrates from citric acid cycle to amino acid metabolism. Metabolic features of platelets characteristic of clopidogrel resistance were low activity of the key reaction of pentose phosphate cycle reflecting state of plastic metabolism, and substrate flow in the tricarbonic acid cycle - determinant of intensity of aerobic energy. Clopidogrel-sensitive patients had increased platelets NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity (the key reaction of lipid anabolism).","Grinshtein I.Y., Savchenko A.A., Grinshtein Y.I., Filonenko I.V., Kosinova A.A.",No DOI,Kardiologiia
Gene Expression Profiling Of Taxol-Resistant Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells With Sirna-Mediated Folr1 Downregulation,"OBJECTIVES: Our previous study has shown that downregulation of FOLR1 by siRNA partially reversed taxol-resistant phenotype in taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. We aim to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this process and identify the differentially expressed genes after FOLR1 downregulation.METHOD: The global gene expression profile was identified and analyzed using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array.RESULTS: There was a significant dysregulation in the global gene expression of the FOLR1-suppressed taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. There were 41 upregulated genes and 109 downregulated genes. QRT-PCR validation of the selected differentially expressed genes demonstrated there was a good correlation with the microarray analysis. There was a significant deregulation of expression in the apoptosis-related genes such as BIRC3, PRKX, TNFRSF10A and involved in Viral carcinogenesis, MAPK signaling pathways after FOLR1 was downregulated.CONCLUSION: The suppression of FOLR1 by RNA interference altered gene expression profile of taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. The apoptosis-related genes and the gene alterations in viral carcinogenesis, MAPK signaling pathways might be important in FOLR1 siRNA-induced taxol-resistant reversal.","Song Y., Peng X., Wang M., Xie J., Tan G.",No DOI,International Journal Of Clinical And Experimental Pathology
Endoscopic Management Of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistulas After Distal Pancreatectomy Or Enucleation,"Only small series (<10 patients) have described endoscopic management of postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPF). The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the indications, technique and results of endoscopic treatment of POPF. Patients and Methods: From a prospective database of an endoscopic unit of a tertiary center, patients with POPF who underwent pancreatic endoscopic treatment during a retrograde endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were identified between January 2010 and June 2016. POPF was classified according to the definition of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula Working Group. The indications, the techniques and results of endoscopic drainage and the patients' outcomes were registered. Results: Among 6473 ERCPs performed during the inclusion period, 31 patients had POPF treated endoscopically (14 men, 7 women, mean age ±standard deviation [SD]: 63 years [±15]). Surgeries at the origin of the fistula were: distal pancreatectomy with spleen resection (n=19); spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy (n=3); central pancreatectomy (n=2); enucleation (n=4); partial pancreatectomy (n=1); left nephrectomy (n=2), for the following indications: IPMN (n=7), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=5), neuroendocrine tumors (n=4), insulinoma (n=3), adrenocortical carcinoma (n=6), metastasis (n=2), pheochromocytoma (n=1), cystadenomas (n=2), spleen artery aneurysm (n=1). The mean time between surgery and first ERCP (±SD, [range]) was 70 days (±145, [6-806]). POPF was grade B in 19 patients and grade C in 12 patients. All patients had somatostatin analogs and 13 (41.9%) had an external radiological drainage prior to endoscopic drainage. In 9 patients (29%) a pancreatic cystogastrostomy was performed during follow-up (FU) in addition to the transpapillary drainage. The pancreatic cannulation rate was 96.8% at the first ERCP and 100% after 2 ERCPs: 90.3% by the major papilla, 9.7% by the minor papilla. All patients had a pancreatic sphincterotomy and the placement of a pancreatic plastic stent. 3 early complications (<72h) occurred: 2 post-sphincterotomy bleeding and 1 perforation, all medically treated. The mean FU (±SD, [range]) was 378 days (±497 [2-2227]) after the first ERCP. During FU, there were 3 stent migrations and 2 stent obstructions requiring a subsequent ERCP for stent replacement. Eight patients (25.8%) died after surgery complications. Among the 23 remaining patients, the closure rate of POPF was 100% within an average (±SD [range]) of 153 days (±81 [16-326]) after the first ERCP, after a mean number of ERCP performed per patient (±SD) 2.5 (±1.0). No late reopening fistula occurred after removal of the pancreatic stent. Conclusion: This retrospective study, the most important one reported to date, shows that the endoscopic treatment of POPF resistant to medical therapy is an effective option in fragile patients.","Camus M., Chaouch S., Leblanc S., Gaujoux S., Paye F., Balladur P., Vaillant J.C., Menegaux F., Massault P.P., Barret M., Coriat R., Chaussade S., Dousset B., Prat F.",No DOI,Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
Effects Of Adipose-Induced Stem Cell Application On Everolimus Immunosuppressed Rats On Colon Anastomosis: An Experimental Study,"Background: There are many factors that affect the safety of gastrointestinal anastomosis. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of the stem cells that are derived fromadipose tissue on wound healing in rats that are immune-suppressed with mTOR inhibitors Materials and Methods: 56 rats were used and they were divided 4 groups: Group 1 (control, colonic anastomosis), group 2 (colonic anastomosis+stem cell), group 3 (colonic anasomosis+immunosuppression), and group 4 (colonic anastomosis+immune supression+stem cell). Adhesion, bursting pressure of the colonic anastomosis, tissue hydroxyproline level measurement, histopathologic and marked stem cell detection by florescent microscope examinations were done. Results: Adhesion wasmost commonly seen in group 3 and stem cell application caused adhesions to be less visible in group 4. On the seventh day, higher tissue hydroxyproline levels were detected than in the fourth day (p<.001). Immunosuppression caused the tissue to decrease in hydroxyproline level. Stem cell administration caused an increase in the level of hydroxyproline in group 2 (p<.001), whereas group 4 did not cause the same effect. On the fourth and seventh day of anastomoses, the highest bursting pressure was found in group 2 and lowest in group 3. Although stem cell administration increased the bursting pressure in group 4 on the fourth day, the same effect was not seen on the seventh day. Histopathologic examination revealed a high level of vascular proliferation in the stem cell group (p<.001) Conclusions: Subserosal stem cell injections to colonic anastomosis in immunosuppressed rats with everolimus increase the anastomotic resistance, and increase the vascular proliferation.","Karakaya E., Akdur A., Atilgan A.O., Ozer H.E.O., Uysal C., Yildirim S., Haberal M.",No DOI,Transplantation

"Immune Cells Regulate Matrix Metalloproteinases To Reshape The Tumor Microenvironment To Affect The Invasion, Migration, And Metastasis Of Pancreatic Cancer","This study aimed to identify author, country, institutional, and journal collaborations and assess their impact, along with knowledge base, as well as identify existing trends, and uncover emerging topics related to matrix metalloproteinase and pancreatic-cancer research. A total of 1474 Articles and reviews were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed by Citespace and Vosviewer. CANCER RESEARCH, CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH, and FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY are the most influential journals. The three main aspects of research in matrix metalloproteinases-pancreatic cancer-related fields included the pathogenesis mechanism of pancreatic cancer, how matrix metalloproteinases affect the metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and what role matrix metalloproteinases play in pancreatic cancer treatment. Tumor microenvironment, pancreatic stellate cells, drug resistance, and immune cells have recently emerged as research hot spots. In the future, exploring how immune cells affect matrix metalloproteinases and reshape the tumor microenvironment may be the key to curing pancreatic cancer. This study thus offers a comprehensive overview of the matrix metalloproteinases-pancreatic cancer-related field using bibliometrics and visual methods, providing a valuable reference for researchers interested in matrix metalloproteinases-pancreatic cancer.","Wang C., Deng Z., Zang L., Shu Y., He S., Wu X.",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
Effect Of The Implemention Of Multidimentional Infection Control Measures On Healthcare Associated Infections In An Intensive Care Unit,"Background: There was an outbreak of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoinae (CRKP) in our intensive care unit (ICU) for that multi-faceted interventions were implemented in two stages since 2015. We hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing incidence of healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Methods:We implemented first stage of infection controlmeasures since October 2015 including complete terminal disinfection and cohort isolation of patients with CRKP or CRPAor VRE. Second stage of interventions started since April 2016 and comprised applying chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing to patients in ICU aswell as finding and disinfection or eradication of niduses from which MDRO were cultured. The items of niduses discovered were feeding cups and plastic baskets belonging to individual bed but not individual patient, working tables of nurses, and two communal bedpans. We analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database since May 2015 at the ICU of 41 beds and calculated the monthly trends of HAIs before and after two stages of infection control measures in ICU after adjusting the effects of hand hygiene and antibiotics usage. In order to assess the changes of HAIs in 3 periods, we used the generalized additive model (GAM). The fixed effects were period, time (per 1 month), DID, the compliance and the accuracy of hand washing, and the random effect was period∗time. The random effect showed the change of HAIs after interventions. (Figure presented) Results: After implementation, the trend of UTI showed reversely downward although the trend of HAP was as same as before (Figure). Therewas a significant reduction trend in UTI after second stage of interventions (RR 0.48, 95%CI 0.23-0.99) (Table). (Table presented) Conclusion: Active surveillance of bacterial niduses and CHG bathing have significant effect in controlling a CRKP outbreak as well as in reducing UTI in an ICU.","Lee Y.-L., Ho C.-H., Kuo T.-T.",No DOI,International Journal Of Antimicrobial Agents
Improved Pedicle Flap Survival With Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Dna Plasmid,"INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is known to produce multiple angiogenic transcription products including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, angiopoietin I and II, and others. In plastic and reconstructive surgery, surgical skin flaps are frequently used to repair acquired and congenital defects. Necrosis of the distal flap is a common complication resulting from poor blood supply to the distal flap. Improving blood flow to such flaps utilizing HIF-1 is an attractive strategy for improving flap survival. Our objective was to explore the feasibility of a local injection of DNA mini-plasmid encoded to express a degradation-resistant HIF-1 construct with Chitosan nanoparticles to improve the survival of ischemic skin flaps in aged rats. METHODS: We previously showed that our preparation of chitosan nanoparticles improves DNA transfection, and that the HIF DNA plasmid produces HIF-1. Two-year-old Sprague Dawley rats were prophylactically infused intradermally in the marked region of dermis where the flaps would be made. The treatment group received 50\iL of 1 ig/L HIF nanoparticle complex, while the controls received 50\iL saline sham injection. One week later, we raised two 1.6 X 8 cm silicone isolated pedicle flaps. Surviving flap area and blood flow measured by Doppler imaging were compared for the treatment and control groups. RESULTS: The viability of treated flap was significantly enhanced, with increased regional blood perfusion compared with that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Local injection of HIF-1 expressing DNA plasmid promotes the viability of dermal pedicle grafts. This approach has potential clinical application in many fields of surgery.","Habibabady Z.A., Lay F., Sebastilan R., Born L.J., Wu L., Ng C., Ahmed A.K., Marti G.P., Harmon J.W.",No DOI,Journal Of The American College Of Surgeons

An Inhibitor Of Rgd Binding Integrins Attenuates Hepatic Stellate Cell Activity Via Inhibition Of The Integrin-Activated Fak-Akt Pathway,"Background: Liver fibrosis is one of the most serious complications of advanced chronic liver disease and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a pivotal role in hepatic fibrogenesis. CWHM12, an analog of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) amino acid sequence found in specific integrins, has been shown to improve liver fibrosis via blocking transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) release from the latent TGF-β complex. However, the possibility that CWHM12 could also have direct effects on HSC activation and proliferation has not been explored The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of the antifibrotic effect of CWHM12 in the HSCs. Methods: We used the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line, LX2 cells which were kindly provided by Dr Scott Friedman, for evaluating the impact of the RGD binding integrin disruption by CWHM12. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% antibiotics, GlutaMAX and 2% FBS on collagen-coated plastic dishes. CWHM12 was synthesized by the Saint Louis University Center for World Health and Medicine Cell viability was evaluated by MTS assay Total and membrane protein were prepared from LX2 cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of LX2 cells were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. All results were evaluated by at least three independent experiments Data were analyzed by two-tailed independent Student's t-test for comparing two means of unpaired samples or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test used as post-hoc analysis for comparing means of three or more samples and presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) as indicated in each figure legend. p values < 0 05 were considered statistically significant. Results: CWHM12 inhibited the interaction between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and RGD-binding integrins expressed by LX2 cells and reduced downstream FAK phosphorylation and consequently AKT phosphorylation. Reduced activation of AKT led to apoptosis via increased p53 and decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) levels, cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase via cyclin D1 reduction, and inhibition of proliferation via suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) Furthermore, CWHM12 decreased both TGF-β receptor I and II plasma membrane expression with a decrease in downstream SMAD3 phosphorylation and TGF-β-mediated gene transcription and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression In summary, blocking integrin signaling with CWHM12 promoted apoptosis and downregulated the delivery of TGF-β receptor to the cell surface and suppressed TGF-β signaling in LX2 cells Conclusion: These results indicate that CWHM12 may suppress activated HSC by blocking the integrin-FAK-AKT signaling pathway and reducing TGF-β receptor expression, mechanisms which may be valuable in reducing and reversing hepatic fibrosis.","Noritake H., Ulmasov B., Talkad V., Kobayashi Y., Neuschwander-Tetri B.A.",No DOI,Hepatology V70 Suppl.1 2019
Use Of Accelerated Fatigue Testing As A Simple In Vitro Test For Assessing Materials For The Surgical Treatment Of Stress Urinary Incontinence And Pelvic Organ Prolapse,"HYPOTHESIS / AIMS OF STUDY: Some mesh material used in surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is associated with serious complications in patients (1). Increasing amount of evidence suggests that PPL material is not biomechanically compatible with the dynamic environment of the female pelvic floor. All meshes implanted in this site will undergo continuous deformation for decades. Materials which undergo irreversible plastic deformation under repeated loading may lead to material failure and/or change in the mechanical properties of the mesh. Although the uniaxial mechanical testing of mesh materials is reported (2), we were unable to find published studies of fatigue testing of these materials. We hypothesized that a test as simple as three-day fatigue testing would be sufficient to distinguish between materials which have already been found to cause complications clinically and newer materials yet to be tested clinically. We propose this as an easy way to eliminate materials will are mechanically inappropriate for implantation in the pelvic floor. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a very simple fatigue testing regime would be sufficient to identify those materials which have previously caused problems clinically in a comparison of 4 commercial meshes and two new electro-spun materials not yet evaluated in the clinic. Uniaxial tensile properties were compared before and three days of continuous 25% dynamic distension applied using a dynamic bio-reactor. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two electrospun materials made of polyurethane (PU) and ureidopyrimidinone-polycaprolactone (UPy) that have not yet been evaluated in the clinic and four other commercially available meshes were included in the study. Two of the meshes were fabricated from PP, a heavy weight PP mesh, Gynemesh® (Johnson & Johnson) and a new ultra-light weight PP mesh, Restorelle® (Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark). The two other commercially available materials were made of polyvinylidene fluroride (PVDF) DynaMesh®-EN-DOLAP and Dynamesh®-PR4 (Dynamesh, Aachen, Germany). A tensiometer (BOSE Electroforce test instruments, Minnesota, USA) was used to perform the uniaxial tensile test and cyclic testing (Figure 1). Samples (n=6, for each material) were cut keeping uniform width and length (30mm × 5mm). For the cyclic test, the material was stretched for 10 cycles at a rate of 1 mm/s and the displacement was adjusted to 25% of its original length. Plastic deformation was measured as the initial % of strain for each sample at the tenth cycle without an increase in stress due to this plastic deformation. For uniaxial tensile testing, a force was applied at a rate of 0.1 mm/s and a displacement of 7mm. Stress vs strain plots are shown as strength (yaxis, MPα) by % of displacement (x axis, %). The initial linear gradient of each plot was taken as the Young's modulus (N/mm2), which is used to measure the stiffness of the material. The failure point was used to measure the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (y axis) and the maximum strain (x axis). Simulated fatigue testing was performed using a TC-3 load bioreactor (Ebers Medical Technology SL, Zaragoza, Spain) and samples were subjected to cyclic uniaxial distension using 25% elongation, 0.1 mm/s rate and 18 cycles per minute over 3 days in phosphate buffered solution at 37°C, 5% CO2. Samples were then re-assessed using the uniaxial tensile test as above. RESULTS: In uniaxial testing, the first thing to note is that most of the materials were able to be stretched until the end of the test (an 80% distension) without significant breaks (Figure 2). Both of the electrospun materials, PU and UPy coped with this 80% deformation whilst maintaining a constant resistance to applied force. Cyclic testing showed that the main change in the mechanical behavior of the different materials happened between cycle 1 and cycle 2 for all materials with permanent mechanical deformation especially for the 4 meshes. After fatigue testing for three days, all commercial meshes failed before they reached 80% strain while the two electro-spun meshes as before coped with 80% displacement (Figure 2). INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that the currently used PP and PVDF meshes are strong but rigid materials which plastically deform after just 3 days of stretching on a regular dynamic cycle whereas the 2 new materials, each based on electro-spun materials, have more elastic properties with much less deformation. CONCLUDING MESSAGE: We suggest that a test as simple as this three-day fatigue testing is sufficient to distinguish between materials which have already been found to cause complications clinically and newer materials yet to be tested clinically which will hopefully prove more mechanically appropriate for implantation in the pelvic floor.","Roman S., Mangir N., Hympanova L., Deprest J., Chappie C.R., Macneil S.",No DOI,Neurourology And Urodynamics
Susceptibility Of Field-Collected Aedes Aegypti (L.) To Conventional Insecticides In Coastal Kenya,"Aedes aegypti are the vectors for many important arboviruses in Kenya, and control options are limited. We evaluated the susceptibility of field populations of nonblood-fed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to four conventional insecticides: permethrin, 0.75%; deltamethrin, 0.05%; bendiocarb, 1%; and fenitrothion, 1%; according to WHO standard procedures. We also determined the efficacy and residual activity of a water dispersible formulation of the biolarvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var Israelensis (Bti) (VectoBac® WG) under semi-field conditions during the dry and wet seasons. Three concentrations of larvicide in 2-L plastic trays were used in this study: 1×, 10× and 20× the manufacturer's recommended dosage (8mg/L, 80mg/L and 160mg/L respectively). Bioassays of adults showed full susceptibility to permethrin and fenitrothion. A low level of resistance was observed for deltamethrin and bendiocarb with 86 and 84% mortality, respectively. Knockdown rate for the first 20 min was notably higher (>90%) for both deltamethrin and permethrin than for bendiocarb and fenitrothion (<10%). Bti was effective under semi-field conditions for an average of 16 days at 8 and 80mg/L and for 22 days at 160mg/L, with 100% mortality during the dry season. In the wet season Bti efficacy at 80 and 160 mg/L lasted for 22 days. The results of this study suggest a need to monitor for developing resistance along the Kenya coast in order to recommend suitable adulticides and dosages for Ae. aegypti control, especially given the recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya.","Ngugi H.N., Mutuku F.M., Ndenga B.A., Irungu L.W., Krystosic A.R., Kitron U., La Beaud A.D.",No DOI,American Journal Of Tropical Medicine And Hygiene
Persistence Of Akt1 Low Quiescent Cancer Cells After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy In Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,"Background: The mechanisms that allow triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors to survive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that proliferative heterogeneity may contribute to primary chemotherapy resistance in patients with localized triple negative breast cancer. However, the detailed characterization of a drug-resistant cancer cell state in residual TNBC tissue after NACT has remained elusive. AKT1(low) quiescent cancer cells (QCCs) are a quiescent, epigenetically plastic, and chemotherapy resistant subpopulation initially identified in experimental cancer models. Here, we asked whether AKT1(low) QCCs actually exist in primary tumors from patients with TNBC and persist after treatment with NACT. Methods: We identified QCCs in primary and metastatic human breast tumors using automated, quantitative, immunofluorescence microscopy coupled with computational and statistical analysis. We obtained pretreatment biopsy, post-treatment mastectomy, and metastatic specimens from a retrospective cohort of TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital (n = 25). Using automated quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy, QCCs were identified as AKT(low)/ H3K9me2(high) HES1(high) cancer cells using prespeciced immunofluorescence intensity thresholds. QCCs were represented as 2D and 3D digital tumor maps and QCC percentage (QCC-P) and QCC cluster index (QCC-CI) were determined for each sample. Results: We found that QCCs exist as non-random and heterogeneously distributed clusters within primary tumors. In addition, these QCC clusters are enriched after treatment with multi-agent, multi-cycle, neoadjuvant chemotherapy in both residual primary tumors as well as nodal and distant metastases in patients with triple negative breast cancer. Conclusions: Together, these data qualify QCCs as a non-genetic mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in triple negative breast cancer patients that warrants further study.","Kabraji S.K., Sole X., Huang Y., Bango C., Bowden M., Bardia A., Sgroi D., Loda M., Ramaswamy S.",No DOI,Journal Of Clinical Oncology
Esrd With Cardiac Ascites Managed With Pleurx Drainage System,"Introduction: The PleurX drainage system has been used to manage fluid from malignant and nonmalignant pleural effusions or malignant ascites at home, with more than 500,000 patients treated since 1997. We present a case of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with refractory cardiac ascites managed with PleurX drainage system. Case Description: A 65-year-old white Veteran presented with advanced heart failure (NYHA Class 4), multiple admission and diuretic-resistant edema formation with stage 5 CKD. While peritoneal dialysis (PD) would have been ideal, he was legally blind and did not have any family support for assisted PD. His medical scenario was initially stabilized with frequent hemodialysis (HD; x4/week) but he experienced recalcitrant ascites formation with severe and symptomatic intra-dialytic hypotension with net ultrafiltration. Moreover, the need for repeated paracentesis every 2 weeks posed a major emotional burden for our patient, including the discomfort and additional time-commitment of the procedure. After appropriate discussion and consenting with the patient, we requested a tunneled, single-lumen catheter placed into the abdominal cavity (PleurX drainage system; originally designed for repeated evacuation of pleural fluid accumulation), 4 months after HD initiation. Tolerability of HD improved and peripheral edemas well-controlled thereafter. Home health monitors his care and performs draining at least x3/week. Exit site care completed with local gentamycin cream and no interval peritonitis was observed so far (9 months). Discussion: Cardio-renal ascites formation may represent a challenge to remove in those with coexisting severe heart failure and ESRD. Ascites fluid accumulation represents the hemodynamic “sinkhole” for patient with cardiac ascites and may be difficult to mobilize these during conventional HD. Plastic catheters in the blood stream are more likely to cause bacteremia than those placed in visceral surfaces (pleura, abdominal cavity). In those ESRD patients with cardiac and cirrhotic ascites, who cannot perform PD, establishing alternative and less-traumatic method of ascites drainage with PleurX drainage system may simplify the care and improve tolerability of HD.","Okamoto K., Perry A.M., Jenssen F., Ullian M.E., Fulop T.",No DOI,Journal Of The American Society Of Nephrology
Platelet-Rich Plasma With Microneedling In Androgenetic Alopecia: Study Of Efficacy Of The Treatment And The Number Of Sessions Required,"Background: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a simple and safe procedure, which has been used for soft tissue and wound healing. PRP has been used in dermatology for skin rejuvenation and alopecia. Objective: The objective of our study was to study efficacy of PRP with microneedling in patients with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and to assess number of sessions required for a patient. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with AGA were studied between August 2016 and October 2018 who did not respond to minoxidil and finasteride. PRP was prepared by centrifugation of patients' blood. PRP with microneedling was done for all patients under aseptic conditions. Four to six sessions were done at an interval of 4 weeks. Subjective and objective scores were assessed based on a visual analog global score. Assessment was done at the first session, every next sitting, and 4 weeks after the last sitting. Follow-up was done at 3rd and 6th month after the last sitting. Results: According to subjective scores, two patients (3.33%) had excellent results, 24 (40%) very good, 22 (36.6%) good, 6 (10%) fair results, and 6 (10%) did not have any response. Objective assessment scores showed that two patients (3.33%) had excellent results, 26 (43.3%) very good, 21 (35%) good, 7 (11.6%) had fair results, and 4 (6.7%) did not have any response. Fifty patients underwent four sessions out of which 40 (i.e. 66%) patients had very good results. Only 10 patients required more than four sessions to achieve good results. Patients were happy with four sessions. There were no side effects noted either during or after the treatment. Conclusion: This study shows PRP with microneedling as an efficacious treatment for AGA and augments the effects of conventional treatment. This study sets example for assessing the number of PRP sessions. A minimum of four sessions is required to achieve very good results.","Yepuri V., Venkataram M.",No DOI,Journal Of Cutaneous And Aesthetic Surgery
Topological Network Analysis Of Differentially Expressed Genes In Cancer Cells With Acquired Gefitinib Resistance,"Background/Aim: Despite great effort to elucidate the process of acquired gefitinib resistance (AGR) in order to develop successful chemotherapy, the precise mechanisms and genetic factors of such resistance have yet to be elucidated. Materials and Methods: We performed a cross-platform meta-analysis of three publically available microarray datasets related to cancer with AGR. For the top 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we clustered functional modules of hub genes in a gene co-expression network and a protein-protein interaction network. We conducted a weighted correlation network analysis of total DEGs in microarray dataset GSE 34228. The identified DEGs were functionally enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) function and KEGG pathway. Results: We identified a total of 1,033 DEGs (510 up-regulated, 523 down-regulated, and 109 novel genes). Among the top 100 up- or down-regulated DEGs, many genes were found in different types of cancers and tumors. Through integrative analysis of two systemic networks, we selected six hub DEGs (Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox1, Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 1, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, S100 calcium binding protein A9, S100 calcium binding protein A8, and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2) associated with calcium homeostasis and signaling, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, or chemoresistance. We confirmed a correlation of expression of these genes in the microarray dataset. Conclusion: Our study may lead to comprehensive insights into the complex mechanism of AGR and to novel gene expression signatures useful for further clinical studies.","Lee Y.S., Hwang S.G., Kim J.K., Park T.H., Kim Y.R., Myeong H.S., Kwon K., Jang C.S., Noh Y.H., Kim S.Y.",No DOI,Cancer Genomics And Proteomics
Development Of A Flexible Port For Repeated Biopsy Of Spontaneous Ovarian Cancer In Domestic Laying Hen (Gallus Gallus Domesticus),"Ovarian cancer is diagnosed in approximately 225,000 women per year accounting for 4% of all cancer cases worldwide on an annual basis. There is an estimated 140,000 deaths per year that are attributed to ovarian cancer. Diagnosis at advanced stages and resistance to treatments contribute to the high 5-year mortality rate. Domestic laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) have been identified as a spontaneous model for ovarian cancer with the potential, once fully characterized, to be the first predictive model and model for therapeutic trials. The chicken develops spontaneous and progressive ovarian cancer that have epidemiologic, morphologic, and molecular traits that are similar to humans. The incidence of spontaneous ovarian cancer in chickens ranges somewhere between 40-70% in chickens over 2 years of age. This is a consequence of constant ovulation resulting in DNA damage and repair of ovarian epithelial cells leading to ovarian cancer, similar to postmenopausal women which account for over half the diagnosed cases of ovarian cancer in women. Chickens make an ideal model due to their limited genetic diversity and predictable age of onset of disease. The development of this model will allow for development of predictive assays and allow for new therapeutics to be tested on spontaneously occurring ovarian cancer. Currently, the only way to diagnose chickens with ovarian cancer is to do invasive endoscopy. Development of surgically implanted ports created with a 3D printer allows for a minimally invasive repeated visualization of the ovary, following the progression of disease, repeated sampling, and treatment monitoring. This allows for the endoscopic visualization and biopsy of the ovary to change from requiring a surgical procedure to only being an anesthetic event. The original design was a hard plastic port that was easily implanted but suffered the complication of rejection. The material was then switched to a soft, flexible silicone and the shape was adjusted to accommodate the location. The new material and design has shown no evidence of port rejection, allowed endoscopic visualization of the ovary, and ports have remained implanted for over 9 months.","Galaviz S., Richert A.T., Smith B.D.",No DOI,Journal Of The American Association For Laboratory Animal Science
"Tumstatin 185-191 Increases The Sensitivity Of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Cells To Cisplatin By Blocking Proliferation, Promoting Apoptosis And Inhibiting Akt Activation","Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the synergistic anti-tumor effects of tumstatin 185-191 and cisplatin in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLC) (A549 cells and cisplatin resistant A549/DDP cells), and the potential role of Akt signaling pathway was also explored. Methods: A549 or A549/DDP cells were treated with Tum185-191 or Tum185-191 plus cisplatin. Cell viability was assessed by modified MTT assay. 50% inhibiting concentration (IC<inf>50</inf>) and reversing drug-resistance index (RI) of chemotherapeutics were determined by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry. The activation of Akt signaling pathway was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot assay. Results: Tum185-191 inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells and A549/DDP cells. In the presence of Tum185-191 (20 and 40 µM), IC<inf>50</inf> of cisplatin reduced significantly in A549 cells and A549/DDP cells. Combined use of tumstatin 185-191 and cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in promoting apoptosis. A549 and A549/DDP cells had a high expression of p-Akt, and Tum185-191, but not cisplatin, significantly inhibited p-Akt expression. Combined use of cisplatin and Tum185-191 failed to further inhibit p-Akt expression. After Tum185-191 treatment, the increased p-Akt expression was observed at 15 min, peaked at 30-60 min, but disappeared at 120 min. Conclusion: Tum185-191 increases the apoptosis, inhibit the proliferation, enhance the sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin and also partly reverse the resistance of A549-DDP cells to cisplatin, which is at least partially mediated by inactivating Akt pathway. These findings provide evidence for the chemotherapy of NSCLC with Tum185-191 and cisplatin.","Wang W., Chen P., Tang M., Li J., Pei Y., Cai S., Zhou X., Chen S.",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
Successful Management Of A Case Of Severe Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Ten) (90%) With Acinetobacter Sepsis In A Non Burn Icu Center,"Introduction:. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an acute inflammatory skin reaction and is the most severe form of drug-induced skin reaction and includes denudation of >30% of total body surface area(1).The average reported mortality rate of TEN is 35-55%; it can be even higher in elderly patients and those with a large surface area of epidermal detachment.(2). There is a significant associated mortality rate which is largely due to secondary infection and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome(3). Carbamazepine, was found as the most common offending drug in India in this series(4) Discontinuation of the offending drug and prompt referral to a burn unit are generally agreed upon steps but specific management guidelines not available(5).Here we report a successful management of a severe case of TEN with 90 % involvement of skin complicated by secondary Acinetobacter infection in a makeshift ICU Room, as we did not have a separate Burns ICU. CASE DESCRIPTION. A 26 year old male with no co morbidities was admitted to a private hospital after he developed wounds in mouth and fluid filled lesions all over body. He was recently started on oxy carbamazepine for alcoholic withdrawal. As the skin lesions were increasing and patient started having fever he was referred to Lakeshore hospital for further care. He was admitted to MICU. Septic workup, Routine Blood investigations, HIV, HbsAg, HCV, VDRL and ANA sent all negative on admission. Rt femoral trple lumen catheter insertion done for iv access as the sampling and peripheral iv access was difficult. Skin examination revealed diffuse regions of skin sloughing with necrosis and a mildly erythematous base along the dermis; there were many bullae and vesicles. Over 60-70% of the patient's total body surface area (BSA) was involved on admission which later progressed to involve 90% of skin. The non-affected area of the patient's skin easily sloughed with lateral traction. The oral mucosa was injected and sloughing apparent. Cornea was spared. And on D2 patient was moved out of ICU to a separate isolation room with monitor and ICU nurse as he has high risk for secondary infection. Plastic surgeon advised Bactigras dressing for exposed areas and other supportive therapy. Skin biopsy report was consistent with STEVEN JOHNSON SYNDROME. SCORTEN score was 4, with an expected mortality of 58.3%.Tab acyclovir added on D4. His course of illness was complicated with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter bacteremia and skin infection with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella and was treated with Tigecycline and Imipenam and new central line. Initially he had intolerance to Feeding and was started on metoclopramide and started on high protein and glutamine sachets and later managed with proburn formula feed. Initially for up to day7 he had positive fluid balance of up to 2-2.5 liter but later kept equal or on negative side since generalized swelling was present and had high CVP. Daily skin care was given by saline soaks or chlorhexidine soaks and banana leaves cleaned with chlorhexidine used over airbed sheet to avoid additional skin damage. Burn hood like instrument put anteriorly with bed sheet to cover body. Finally got discharged on day 25 with small wounds over his sacral region and both feet. CONCLUSION: Severe TEN case management requires a judicious use of Fluids and early appropriate treatment of secondary infections. Securing lines and dressing of wounds is challenging. But with a good supportive ICU care and Nutrition, mortality can be prevented as demonstrated in this case.","Dore C.A., Mathew M., Cherian S.",No DOI,Indian Journal Of Critical Care Medicine
Microparticle Based Microgel For The Study Of The Tumoral Microenvironment (Tme),"Background: Tissue engineering methodologies have been used to generate in vitro models that emulate the characteristics of different types of cancer, including lung cancer. Lung cancer stands out for its great capacity for dissemination and mortality, based in part on the great capacity of cancer cells to develop drug resistance and in part on the complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME). TME includes fibroblasts, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix components. The interactions between they determine the characteristic behavior of lung cancer. We propose to generate a threedimensional model for the in vitro study that allows us to better understand the interaction between CAFs, non-tumor fibroblasts and cancer cells. This system will allow not only to identify new possible pharmacological targets, but also to increase our knowledge regarding to the acquisition of drug resistance or the metastasis process. Methods: Alginate microspheres with a diameter around 250 μm were produced by microfluidics. The surface was coated with two bilayers of gelatin/alginate polyelectrolyte multilayer using a layer-by-layer, LbL, procedure. A covalent cross-linking of the coating was performed with glutaraldehyde followed by a treatment with glycine to inactivate remnant unreacted aldehyde groups. CAFs and non-tumor fibroblasts were isolated from 4 human lung cancer tumors. Cells were characterized by flow cytometry according to CD29, CD31, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD105, CD146, and STRO-1 expression. The cells were cultured with microparticle in DMEM cultured medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone for 72 hours under orbital shaking. Agarose-coated cell culture wells were used to prevent cell adhesion to the plastic of the culture plates. Cell adhesion and morphological characteristics of CAFs and non-tumor fibroblasts were studied by fluorescence staining of F-acting using phalloidin-rhodamine. Vimentin, FSP1, type I collagen, and N-cadherin expression were analyzed by immunofluorescence and real time RT-PCR. Results: The isolated cells were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105 and CD146, and negative for CD31, CD45 and STRO-1. Significative differences in the expression of CD45 (18.45 ± 2.14 positive CAFs compared to 8.27 ± 1.15 positive non-tumoral fibroblasts) were found. After 72 hours of culture, the cells adhered to the microparticles. These cells showed a stellate morphology, with abundant actin stress fibers. Vimentin and FSP1 expression was significantly higher compared to that of cells cultured in the absence of microparticles. Likewise, a marked expression of type I collagen by the cells cultured on the microspheres was detected. No significant differences were observed between CAFs and non-tumor fibroblasts in relation to the proteins studied. Conclusion: The manufactured microparticles represent a suitable support for the culture of stromal cells isolated from lung cancer tumor tissue. The cells that adhered to the microparticles acquired a more marked secretory mesenchymal phenotype compared to that cells cultured in conventional 2D systems. This system will allow the generation of co-culture systems of CAFs and non-tumor fibroblasts in different ratios in a controlled manner, being a suitable in vitro system for the study of the effects of different drugs on stromal cells of TME.","Milian L., Martinez-Vallejo P., Monleon I., Garcia-Briega I., Rodenas J., Gomez Ribelles J.L., Sancho-Tello M., De Llano J.J.M., Carda C., Mata M.",No DOI,Tissue Engineering - Part A
Novel Mechanisms Of Resistance To Vemurafenib In Melanoma - V600E B-Raf Reversion And Switching Vegf-A Splice Isoform Expression,"Targeting activating mutations in the proto-oncogene B-Raf, in melanoma, has led to increases in progression free survival. Treatment with vemurafenib, which inhibits the most common activating-mutated form of B-Raf (B-Raf(V600E)), eventually results in resistance to therapy. VEGF-A is the principal driver of angiogenesis in primary and metastatic lesions. The bioactivity of VEGF-A is dependent upon alternative RNA splicing and pro-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF-A are upregulated in many disease states dependent upon angiogenesis, including cancers. Using techniques including RT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA and luciferase reporter assays, the effect of vemurafenib on proliferation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the levels of pro- and anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoforms was investigated in melanoma cell types expressing either wild-type B-Raf or B-Raf(V600E), including a primary melanoma culture derived from a highly vascularised and active nodule taken from a patient with a V600E mutant melanoma. The primary melanoma culture was characterised and found to have reverted to wild-type B-Raf. In B-Raf(V600E) A375 cells ERK1/2 phosphorylation, pro-angiogenic VEGF-A mRNA, total VEGF-A protein expression and VEGF-A 3'UTR activity were all decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by vemurafenib. Conversely vemurafenib treatment of wild-type B-Raf cells significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, pro-angiogenic VEGF-A mRNA and total VEGF-A expression in a concentration-dependent manner. A switch to pro-angiogenic VEGF-A isoforms, with a concomitant upregulation of expression by increasing VEGF-A mRNA stability, may be an additional oncogenic and pathological mechanism in B-Raf(V600E) melanomas, which promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis and melanoma-genesis. We have also identified the genetic reversal of B-Raf(V600E) to wild-type in an active melanoma nodule taken from a V600E-positive patient and continued vemurafenib treatment for this patient is likely to have had a detrimental effect by promoting B-Raf(WT) activity.","Beazley-Long N., Gaston K., Harper S.J., Orlando A., Bates D.O.",No DOI,American Journal Of Cancer Research
T Cell Responses In Patients With Melanoma Resistant To Multiple Immunotherapies,"Background: The majority of patients with metastatic melanoma obtain only shortterm or no benefit at all from checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether the immune system of patients progressing on or following treatment with CPI was able to generate functional tumor-specific immune responses. Methods: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated and expanded from metastatic melanoma lesions in progression on or after anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Tumor-specific immune responses were assessed with co-culture assays of TILs and autologous tumor cells. In a phase I/II clinical trial, TILs were administered with lymphodepleting chemotherapy, pegIFNa2b and IL-2 to 12 patients with CPI-resistant melanoma. Results: TILs from 19 metastases of an equal number of patients could be assessed for T cell recognition of autologous tumor cells. All metastases were progressive on or following anti-PD-1 (19/19) and anti-CTLA-4 (16/19). Functional anti-Tumor immune responses were detected in 15/19 patients (79%). Both CD8+ (in 14/19 patients, 74%) and CD4+ (in 14/19 patients, 74%) TILs were able to recognize autologous tumors. On average, a large fraction of CD8+ TILs (mean 25%, range 1.1-84%) recognized tumor cells. This is similar or higher than in cohorts of unselected patient populations with metastatic melanoma presented in previous studies. Additional histology analyses to identify the location of the immune infiltrates are ongoing. Out of 12 patients with anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1-resistant melanoma treated with TILs, two partial responses were observed, of which one is ongoing. Conclusions: Tumor-reactive T cells appear to infiltrate heavily the tumor microenvironment of patients who failed previous CPIs. These patients can still respond to infusion of unselected autologous TILs. Our results warrant further testing of novel immune re-Activation strategies in anti-PD-1-/anti-CTLA-4-resistant melanoma.

The Inhibition Of Braf Activity Sensitizes Chemoresistant Human Ovarian Cancer Cells To Paclitaxel-Induced Cytotoxicity And Tumor Growth Inhibition,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and the second most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in women worldwide. While ovarian cancer is highly heterogeneous in histological subtypes and molecular genetic makeup, epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common subtype. The clinical outcomes of ovarian cancer largely depend on early detection and access to appropriate surgery and systemic therapy. While combination therapy with platinum-based drugs and paclitaxel (PTX) remains the first-line systemic therapy for ovarian cancer, many patients experience recurrence and die of progressive chemoresistance. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to overcome recurrent disease due to resistance to chemotherapies of ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated whether BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) could sensitize PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells to PTX, and thus would overcome the resistance to chemotherapies. We found that BRAF and several members of the RAS/MAPK pathways were upregulated upon PTX treatment in ovarian cancer cells, and that BRAF expression was significantly elevated in the PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells. While the BRAFi vemurafenib (VEM) alone did not cause any significant cytotoxicity in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells, VEM significantly enhanced PTX-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, VEM and PTX were shown to synergistically inhibit tumor growth and cell proliferation of PTX-resistant human ovarian cancer cells in vivo. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that BRAFi may be exploited as synergistic sensitizers of paclitaxel in treating chemoresistant ovarian cancer.","Zhao L., Huang L., Zhang J., Fan J., He F., Zhao X., Wang H., Liu Q., Shi D., Ni N., Wagstaff W., Pakvasa M., Fu K., B Tucker A., Chen C., Reid R.R., Haydon R.C., Luu H.H., Shen L., Qi H., He T.-C.",No DOI,American Journal Of Translational Research
"A Multi-Contrast X-Ray Fluorescence, X-Ray Luminescence And X-Ray Ct Functional Imaging Platform For In Vivo Imaging Of Non-Radioactive Therapeutic Agents In Small Animals","Objectives: The clinical use of the metal-based anti-tumor drug, cisplatin, has waned since its discovery in 1965 due to the serious side effects such as myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and increasing drug resistance after recurrent treatments [1]-[5]. Thus researchers have begun investigating utilizing other metals, such as hafnium and gold, for radioenhancement [6], [7]. For instance, Dr. Wenbin Lin has developed radiosensitizers based on a nanoscale metal-organic framework (NMOF) containing hafnium for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT), which converts incoming X-ray irradiation into visible light through X-ray luminescence (XL), which in turn is converted to cytotoxic singlet oxygen via a conjugated photosensitizer [8]. However, the biological behavior and pharmacological mechanism of these metallodrugs are poorly understood due to the intrinsically complex nature of the human body. In this presentation, we report a recently developed functional X-ray imaging platform for imaging a wide range of metals in both tissue samples and small lab animals and present X-ray fluorescence (XF) and X-ray luminescence (XL) imaging of several metallodrugs in mouse phantoms. Methods: The Design of the XFCT/XLCT Functional Imaging Platform. Fig. A shows our XLCT/XFCT imaging platform where the X-ray luminescence signal is collected by an Andor iXon 887 EMCCD coupled to a demagnifying tube and then a Zeiss lens coupled to band-pass optical filters, and the X-ray fluorescence signal is collected by an Andor iKon-L DO936 direct-conversion CCD camera consisting of a 2048 by 2048 array of 13.5 μm square pixels. The upgraded system that we will discuss in this presentation is shown in Fig. B, where the CCD camera is replaced by a half-ring of HEXITEC CdTe detector modules to cover a wider X-ray energy range of 5 keV to 120 keV and provide a spatial resolution of 250 μm. Each detector module of 2 cm x 2 cm is coupled to a multiple-slit aperture of 100-300 μm width that runs perpendicular to the incident X-ray beam. The system contains two X-ray sources: a filterable 50 kVp polychromatic source and a 17.4 keV monochromatic source. From these sources and filtering, an optimized incident X-ray energy can be selected to efficiently produce XL or XF in the sample. Imaging Studies: A plastic mouse phantom containing four 400 μm diameter channels each filled with Y(2)O(3):Eu(3+)nanoparticles, LaF3:Tb nanoparticles, HfO2 nanoparticles and cisplatin. Both the Y(2)O(3):Eu(3+)and LaF3:Tb nanoparticles are capable of both XF and XL emissions while cisplatin and HfO2 would only produce XF. Therefore, a multiplexed XF/XL image can be produced from this sample. Additionally, a resolution phantom containing LaF3:Tb nanoparticles will also be imaged using both XF and XL and coregistered together. The system's resolution and sensitivity for both the XF and XL imaging of this agent will also be examined and presented. Results: Fig C shows a multi-isotope spectrum consisting of Am, Co, and(99m) Tc acquired using a HEXITEC detector. For the 122 keV peak of Co, an 0.75 % energy resolution was observed. The preliminary system successfully acquired tri-modal images with Fig. D-F co-registered with a CT image. The sample is an 8-mm diameter gel phantom containing three 600 μm diameter channels of Y(2)O(3):Eu(3+)NPs. The images obtained include XF slice with the energy selected for the 14.96 keV K α1 peak of yttrium (Fig. D), and the XL slice of the NP (Fig. E). Lastly, Fig. F shows a 3D-rendered combined image of the dual emission image. Conclusions: The preliminary results already demonstrate the potential for a dual contrast system to monitor the distribution of NPs and their therapeutic delivery through XF and XL. The upgraded system using a partial ring of HEXITEC detectors for XF detection will be presented as well as the overall imaging sensitivity and resolution of the dual contrasting imaging platform.","Chen Y., George J., Zannoni E.M., Meng L.-J.",No DOI,Journal Of Nuclear Medicine
Micrornas In Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are Differentially Expressed According To Response In Multiple Myeloma,"Background: Bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) by supporting plasma cell growth, survival and drug resistance. These abilities have been attributed in part to the secretion of growth factors and cytokines by bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC). microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can be released and transferred among MM cells and BM-MSCs as cell-cell communication. Recently, we defined a serum 14-miRNA signature which was associated with progression and complete remission (CR) after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with MM. Patients in CR showed a partial recovery of the normal serum miRNA levels and these are similar to those samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Thus, these results highlight the potential value of serum miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers with a cell origin different from malignant plasma cells. The aim of this study was to discover whether the MSC miRNA profile varies depending on the status of the disease. Methods: Mononuclear cells from BM samples were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After a week, non-adherent cells were removed, whereas BM-MSC were selected by their adherence to the plastic and their phenotype was confirmed by multiparametric flow cytometry. We analyzed 670 microRNAs in 20 primary BM-MSC from patients with MGUS (N=4), symptomatic MM (N=8) and MM in CR (N=8). miRNAs differentially expressed were identified according to a supervised analysis using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and Student's t-test based on multivariate permutation (with random variance model). miRNAs differentially expressed between groups of patients were validated in an extended cohort of BMMSC from patients (N= 82) in all the different status disease: MGUS (N=23), MM at diagnosis (N=13), relapsed MM (N=11), MM in partial response (PR) (N=13) and MM in CR (N=22), as well as in malignant plasma cells (CD38+) from those patients with symptomatic MM. In order to identify miRNA targets, we used the RmiR package to cross-correlate the miRNA expression data from the present study with our findings on the gene expression signature in 12 BM-MSCs from patients (4 MGUS, 4 symptomatic MM and 4 in CR), based on the predicted targets from TargetScan and miRBase databases. Results: In the screening phase, we identified a miRNA profile of 10 miRNAs (miR-663b, miR-654-3p, miR-206, miR-411∗miR-885-5p, miR-668, miR-638, miR-485-3p, miR-744∗and miR-199a) differentially expressed between patients with symptomatic MM and MM in CR (adjusted p-value <0.0001). In the validation phase, miR-485-3p and miR-654-3p resulted differentially expressed in the three groups of patients: MGUS, symptomatic MM and patients in CR (ANOVA test: p=0.0101 and p=0.0228, respectively) (Figure 1(+)A and 1B(+)). The levels of these miRNAs were significantly decreased in patients with MM when compared with MGUS, and these levels seemed to recover when patients achieved CR. These two miRNAs (miR-485-3p and miR-654-3p) were also correlated with all degrees of response in MM: diagnosis, relapse, PR and CR (ANOVA test: p=0.0154 and p=0.0487, respectively). Moreover, paired cross-correlation among these two miRNAs expression with our results in mRNA gene expression profile data showed several potential gene targets with a biological interest, such as MELK and MAP2K2 (correlation index < -0.8). Finally, miR-485-3p and miR-654-3p showed a higher expression in BM-MSC than in MM CD38+ cells (Figure 1C and 1D), suggesting MSC as cell of origin for these miRNAs. Conclusion: In patients with monoclonal gammopathies, miR-485-3p and miR-654-3p expression in mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow is related to the status of the disease and the response to treatment in MM. The modulation of miRNAs profile in the bone marrow microenvironment around malignant plasma cells could be an important mechanism of control by cell-cell communication and the basis for potential biomarkers in serum and bone marrow.","De Larrea C.F., Navarro A., Diaz T., Lozano E., Mena M.-P., Isola I., Cibeira M.T., Rosinol L., Bladé J.",No DOI,Blood
