GreenFILE,8gh,164347005,Microplastics accumulate priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens: Evidence from the riverine plastisphere.,"Microplastics (MPs) might accumulate and transport antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in aquatic systems. We determined the abundance and diversity of culturable ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria in biofilms covering MPs placed in river water, and characterized priority pathogens from these biofilms. Our results showed that the abundance of ARB colonizing MPs tends to be higher compared to sand particles. Also, higher numbers were cultivated from a mixture of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), compared to PP and PET alone. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas isolates were the most frequently retrieved from MPs placed before a WWTP discharge while Enterobacteriaceae dominated the culturable plastisphere 200 m after the WWTP discharge. Ciprofloxacin- and/or cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 54 unique isolates) were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 9), Enterobacter spp. (n = 4) and Shigella sp. (n = 1). All isolates presented at least one of the virulence features tested (i.e. biofilm formation, haemolytic activity and production of siderophores), 70% carried the intI1 gene and 85% exhibited a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [ aacA4-cr (40% of the isolates), qnrS (30%), qnrB (25%), and qnrVC (8%)], along with mutations in gyrA (70%) and parC (72%). Cefotaxime-resistant strains (n = 23) harbored bla CTX-M (70%), bla TEM (61%) and bla SHV (39%). Among CTX-M producers, high-risk clones of E. coli (e.g. ST10 or ST131) and K. pneumoniae (ST17) were identified, most of which carrying bla CTX-M-15. Ten out of 16 CTX-M producers were able to transfer bla CTX-M to a recipient strain. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the riverine plastisphere, harboring ARGs of clinical concern and exhibiting virulence traits, suggesting a contribution of MPs to the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens. The type of MPs and especially water contamination (e.g. by WWTPs discharges) seem to determine the resistome of the riverine plastisphere. [Display omitted] • MPs had higher antibiotic-resistant bacteria levels than sand. • Antibiotic-resistant bacteria abundance depended on the MP type. • Abundance of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae increased after WWTP discharge. • MPs hosted high-risk clones of priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens. • The plastisphere contained clinically concerning mobile ARGs (e.g. bla CTX-M).",20230901,"Silva, Isabel ; Rodrigues, Elsa T. ; Tacão, Marta ; Henriques, Isabel",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Plastic marine debris ; Escherichia coli ; Pathogenic microorganisms ; Ciprofloxacin ; Enterobacteriaceae ; Microplastics ; Klebsiella pneumoniae ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Multidrug resistance,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,332,,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121995,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=bf664d02-f31b-358d-becf-84bbeaad7320
GreenFILE,8gh,178953758,Microplastics Aided Augmentation of Antibiotic Resistance in WWTPs: A Global Concern.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment are the major subject of concern across the globe as they jeopardize not only aquatic life but human health as well. MPs are potentially competent to adsorb various micropollutants (heavy metals), bacterial communities, and biofilm formation which comply with the requirement of efficient sorption of antibiotics and transfer of ARGs. MPs adsorb antibiotics through physicochemical interactions, leading to the formation of biofilm-enriched bacteria on the surfaces of MPs that further enhances the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and facilitates their dispersal. Therefore, this review recapitulates the interactive forces responsible for antibiotics sorption on MPs and also the intricate relationship between MPs, antibiotics, and microbial hosts of ARGs. Furthermore, the role of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which serve as a formidable connecting link between MPs and the ecosystem, is discussed in relation to dissemination of antibiotics, ARGs, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) to get a clear perception of the contribution of WWTPs in drawing together MPs with antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs.",20240801,"Rajput, Meenakshi ; Mathur, Nupur ; Singh, Anuradha ; Bhatnagar, Pradeep",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2024,true,"Water, Air & Soil Pollution",Sewage disposal plants ; Bacterial communities ; Heavy metals ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Biofilms,JOUR,,,0049-6979,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,17,1,17,235,8,10.1007/s11270-024-07326-8,,2G2,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=69b2b1da-f89c-30ff-b3d7-ab206de3b63c
GreenFILE,8gh,181192437,Microplastics exacerbate the ecological risk of antibiotic resistance genes in wetland ecosystem.,"Wetlands are vital components of the global ecosystem, significantly influencing the retention and dissemination of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the effects of different types of MPs on the environmental dynamics of ARGs within these ecosystems remain poorly understood. This study focused on the distribution and composition of ARGs associated with two primary types of MPs—polyethylene and polypropylene—within the Poyang Lake wetland, the largest freshwater lake in China, utilizing metagenomic analysis. The findings demonstrated that the bacterial communities and ARG profiles in the plastisphere were markedly distinct from those in the surrounding water. Specifically, thirteen opportunistic pathogens and forty subtypes of ARGs, primarily related to multidrug, bacitracin, and β-lactam resistance, were identified in the plastisphere. Notably, polyethylene exhibited four times more specific ARG subtypes than polypropylene. Procrustes analysis combined with network analysis indicated a lack of strong correlation between ARG abundance and bacterial populations, suggesting potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within the microbiota of the plastisphere. Additionally, three novel and functional β-lactamase genes were identified within this environment. This investigation highlights the role of MPs as reservoirs for ARGs, facilitating their exchange and posing risks to both ecological integrity and human health, thereby underscoring the need for increased attention in future research efforts. • Microplastics significantly enriched pathogenic bacteria and ARGs. • Polyethylene harbored 4-fold more ARG subtypes than polypropylene. • Potential horizontal transfer of ARGs within microplastic microbiota. • Three novel β-lactamases were identified in plastisphere.",20241215,"Liu, Shuli ; Cao, Jian ; Yu, Jinli ; Jian, Minfei ; Zou, Long",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024,true,Journal of Environmental Management,Ecological integrity ; Lakes ; Plastic marine debris ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Bacterial population,JOUR,,,0301-4797,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,372,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123359,,EMJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=64bd18e8-3307-3a3e-b2ba-866cc321d416
GreenFILE,8gh,182345143,The combination of polystyrene microplastics and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate promotes the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria.,"Plastic pollution has become a common phenomenon. The process of plastic degradation is accompanied by the release of microplastics and plasticizers. However, the coexistence of microplastics and plasticizers on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not been reported until now. Here, polystyrene (PS) microplastics and plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were used for combined treatment experiment and their effects and mechanisms on the transfer of ARGs between bacteria were explored. By increasing cell membrane permeability and the expression of correlated genes, the combined treatment group showed promoting effects on the transfer of ARGs than that of control, with the highest promoting effects observed at 1 mg/L PS and 0.1 mg/L DEHP, which was 3.0 times higher in ARGs transfer rate than that of control. It was found that PS and DEHP treatment alone also led to a higher conjugative transfer frequency, and the frequency of the combined treatment was lower than that of the corresponding single treatment group. This indicated that the effects of DEHP and microplastics on ARGs transfer might be antagonistic. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the transfer of ARGs affects bacterial ion binding, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism processes, while the expression of genes related to cell membrane permeability, DNA repair, bacterial drug resistance, and quorum sensing also increase. This study may provide new insights for explaining the combined effects of various pollutants in the environment on the spread of ARGs. [Display omitted] • Combined effects of nanoplastics and DEHP on conjugative transfer was analyzed. • The aggregation of nanoplastics and its adsorption on DEHP reduced combined effects. • The co-addition of nanoplastics and DEHP can promote the transfer of ARGs.",20250101,"Li, Yu ; Liu, Xiaomei ; Guo, Saisai ; Wang, Lan ; Tang, Jingchun",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2025,true,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety,Plasticizers ; Membrane permeability (Biology) ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Drug resistance,JOUR,,,0147-6513,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,289,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.117681,,L0E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=98a39ffc-7b20-302e-baa9-195c255d4f3a
GreenFILE,8gh,175524368,Marine plastisphere selectively enriches microbial assemblages and antibiotic resistance genes during long-term cultivation periods.,"Several studies have focused on identifying and quantifying suspended plastics in surface and subsurface seawater. Microplastics (MPs) have attracted attention as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the marine environment. Plastispheres, specific biofilms on MP, can provide an ideal niche to spread more widely through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), thereby increasing risks to ecosystems and human health. However, the microbial communities formed on different plastic types and ARG abundances during exposure time in natural marine environments remain unclear. Four types of commonly used MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were periodically cultured (46, 63, and 102 d) in a field-based marine environment to study the co-selection of ARGs and microbial communities in marine plastispheres. After the first 63 d of incubation (p < 0.05), the initial 16S rRNA gene abundance of microorganisms in the plastisphere increased significantly, and the biomass subsequently decreased. These results suggest that MPs can serve as vehicles for various microorganisms to travel to different environments and eventually provide a niche for a variety of microorganisms. Additionally, the qPCR results showed that MPs selectively enriched ARGs. In particular, tetA, tetQ, sul1, and qnrS were selectively enriched in the PVC-MPs. The abundances of intl1 , a mobile genetic element, was measured in all MP types for 46 d (5.22 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 8.21 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies), 63 d (5.90 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 2.49 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies), and 102 d (4.00 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 5.11 × 10<sup>−6</sup> copies/16s rRNA gene copies). Network analysis indicated that ARG profiles co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria. This study suggests that the selection of ARGs and their co-occurring bacteria in MPs could potentially accelerate their transmission through HGT in natural marine plastics. [Display omitted] • Co-selection of microbial assemblages and ARGs was explored in a field-based marine plastisphere. • Selective ARG enrichment, notably in PVC, poses health and eco risks. • Intl1, tetA, tetQ, ermB , and sul1 co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria on the MP surface.",20240301,"Kim, Hyunsu ; Yoo, Keunje",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Environmental Pollution,Microbial communities ; Biodegradable plastics ; Mobile genetic elements ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Biofilms ; Genes,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,344,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123450,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d2070ae7-3790-3318-aaa2-fd57a1cc192f
GreenFILE,8gh,169815139,Alteration of the migration trajectory of antibiotic resistance genes by microplastics in a leachate activated sludge system.,"The environmental behavior of emerging contaminants of microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the leachate activated sludge system has been monitored and analyzed comprehensively. The results suggested that MPs could effectively alter the migration trajectory of tetracycline resistance genes (tet genes) in the leachate activated sludge system under intermittent and continuous influent conditions. After adding MPs, the total average abundance of tet genes in leachate increased from 0.74 ± 0.07 to 0.78 ± 0.07 (log 10 tet genes/log 10 16S rRNA) and that in sludge increased from 0.65 ± 0.08 to 0.70 ± 0.06 (log 10 tet genes/log 10 16S rRNA). Except for tetA , the abundance of tetB , tetO , tetM and tetQ on MPs increased with increasing TC concentration under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. MPs not only significantly affect the abundance level and migration trajectory of ARGs in the leachate activated sludge system, but also remarkably improve the level of heavy metals in the ambient environment, indirectly promoting the selective effect of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and promoting the development of antibiotic resistance (AR). In addition, MPs changed their physicochemical properties and released hazardous substances with aging to force tet genes to migrate from the leachate activated sludge system to the MPs, making AR more difficult to eliminate and persisted in wastewater treatment plants. Meanwhile, microorganisms played a driving role, making MPs serve as a niche for ARGs and ARB colonization. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated the specific distribution pattern of tet genes and microorganisms in different media, and the potential host was speculated. This study improves the understanding of the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants in leachate activated sludge system and lays a theoretical for protecting the ecological environment. [Display omitted] • MPs altered the migration trajectory of tet genes in leachate biotreatment system. • MPs as enrichment carriers of ARGs and ARB promote the persistence of AR. • The abundance of tet (B , O , M and Q) on MPs increased with increasing TC. • MPs remarkably elevated the levels of ARGs and heavy metals in leachate environment. • MPs are ubiquitous in leachate activated sludge system and compete for ARGs.",20230915,"Liu, Hongyuan ; Li, Hong ; Qiu, Libo ; Xie, Qiaona ; Lu, Yingying ; Chen, Binhui ; Wang, Hua ; Long, Yuyang ; Hu, Lifang ; Fang, Chengran",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Leachate ; Sewage disposal plants ; Hazardous substance release ; Activated sludge process ; Biodegradable plastics ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,333,,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121981,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=781ae1b9-80ea-39d4-86df-69977ba3b693
GreenFILE,8gh,179138875,Metagenomic insights into ecological risk of antibiotic resistome and mobilome in riverine plastisphere under impact of urbanization.,"[Display omitted] • Urbanization shaped the distribution of antibiotic resistome in plastisphere. • Population density was the key factor for proliferating antibiotic resistome. • Polymer types of microplastics affected antibiotic resistome and mobilome. • Leaf-biofilms harbored the lowest levels of mobile genetic elements. • Polylactic acid could serve as an alternative to traditional plastics. Microplastics (MPs) are of increasing concern due to their role as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens. To date, few studies have explored the influence of anthropogenic activities on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) within various riverine MPs, in comparison to their natural counterparts. Here an in-situ incubation was conducted along heavily anthropogenically-impacted Houxi River to characterize the geographical pattern of antibiotic resistome, mobilome and pathogens inhabiting MPs- and leaf-biofilms. The metagenomics result showed a clear urbanization-driven profile in the distribution of ARGs, MGEs and pathogens, with their abundances sharply increasing 4.77 to 19.90 times from sparsely to densely populated regions. The significant correlation between human fecal marker crAssphage and ARG (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.67, P =0.003) indicated the influence of anthropogenic activity on ARG proliferation in plastisphere and natural leaf surfaces. And mantel tests and random forest analysis revealed the impact of 17 socio-environmental factors, e.g., population density, antibiotic concentrations, and pore volume of materials, on the dissemination of ARGs. Partial least squares-path modeling further unveiled that intensifying human activities not only directly boosted ARGs abundance but also exerted a comparable indirect impact on ARGs propagation. Furthermore, the polyvinylchloride plastisphere created a pathogen-friendly habitat, harboring higher abundances of ARGs and MGEs, while polylactic acid are not likely to serve as vectors for pathogens in river, with a lower resistome risk score than that in leaf-biofilms. This study highlights the diverse ecological risks associated with the dissemination of ARGs and pathogens in varied MPs, offering insights for the policymaking of usage and control of plastics within urbanization.",20240801,"Yan, Weifu ; Bai, Rui ; Zhang, Qinghua ; Jiang, Yuhao ; Chen, Geng ; Zhang, Yanru ; Wu, Yicheng ; Guo, Xuetao ; Xiao, Yong ; Zhao, Feng",Article,Academic Journal,Aug2024,true,Environment International,Mobile genetic elements ; Disease risk factors ; Polylactic acid ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Random forest algorithms,JOUR,,,0160-4120,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,190,,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108946,,JQ0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f79a2390-5e76-30db-ad35-703363f06a24
GreenFILE,8gh,179262401,Distinct species turnover patterns shaped the richness of antibiotic resistance genes on eight different microplastic polymers.,"Elucidating the formation mechanism of plastisphere antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) on different polymers is necessary to understand the ecological risks of plastisphere ARGs. Here, we explored the turnover and assembly mechanism of plastisphere ARGs on 8 different microplastic polymers (4 biodegradable (bMPs) and 4 non-biodegradable microplastics (nMPs)) by metagenomic sequencing. Our study revealed the presence of 479 ARGs with abundance ranging from 41.37 to 58.17 copies/16S rRNA gene in all plastispheres. These ARGs were predominantly multidrug resistance genes. The richness of plastisphere ARGs on different polymers had a significant correlation with the contribution of species turnover to plastisphere ARGs β diversity. Furthermore, polymer type was the most critical factor affecting the composition of plastisphere ARGs. More opportunistic pathogens carrying diverse ARGs on BMPs (PBAT, PBS, and PHA) with higher horizontal gene transfer potential may further magnify the ecological risks and human health threats. For example, the opportunistic pathogens Riemerella anatipestifer , Vibrio campbellii , and Vibrio cholerae are closely related to human production and life, which were the important potential hosts of many plastisphere ARGs and mobile genetic elements on BMPs. Thus, we emphasize the urgency of developing the formation mechanism of plastisphere ARGs and the necessity of controlling BMPs and ARG pollution, especially BMPs, with ever-increasing usage in daily life.

Microplastics have the ability to absorb antibiotic pollutants in water, but the specific adsorption behavior and mechanism are not fully understood, particularly in relation to the impact of microplastics on toxicity in aquatic environments. We review the interaction, mechanism, and transport of microplastics and antibiotics in water environments, with a focus on the main physical characteristics and environmental factors affecting adsorption behavior in water. We also analyze the effects of microplastic carriers on antibiotic transport and long‐distance transport in the water environment. The toxic effects of microplastics combined with antibiotics on aquatic organisms are systematically explained, as well as the effect of the adsorption behavior of microplastics on the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.

GreenFILE,8gh,180587404,Plastic Debris in the Aquatic Environment: An Emerging Substratum for Antimicrobial Resistant (AMR) Biofilms.,"Plastic pollution has quadrupled over the past years and has become a global concern due to its direct impact on life forms. The present study analysed whether the plastic debris in aquatic environments could act as the substratum for the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria to form biofilm for survival. We have collected various plastic debris (n = 32) from six sites of the Periyar River, the drinking water source for the entire city and one of the most polluted rivers in Kerala (India). The chemical composition of plastics was screened via FTIR analysis and found that they comprised two types, viz., polyethylene and polypropylene. Bacteria isolated from the samples were screened for the AMR characteristics towards eight different classes of antibiotics. All isolates showed 100% resistance towards colistin and obtained the MAR index value of 0.1–0.4 range. Six representative bacterial isolates with high multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index were selected and identified by 16sRNA sequencing as Lysinibacillus mangiferihumi, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus altitudins and Bacillus pumilus. In vitro biofilm formation was experimented on the purchased plastic samples in artificial media and river water using two selected strains, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus cereus. Significant variations were observed in biofilm growth in different media (P < 0.05) regardless of plastic types (P > 0.05). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the characteristic holes on the surface morphology were visualized in SEM analysis, thus indicating the conditioning of the plastics by the isolates for biofilm formation.",20241001,"Suresh, Sneha ; Ambily, S.

GreenFILE,8gh,176150467,Regulation of ARGs abundance by biofilm colonization on microplastics under selective pressure of antibiotics in river water environment.,"Interactions of microplastics (MPs) biofilm with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics in aquatic environments have made microplastic biofilm an issue of keen scholarly interest. The process of biofilm formation and the degree of ARGs enrichment in the presence of antibiotic-selective pressure and the impact on the microbial community need to be further investigated. In this paper, the selective pressure of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and illumination conditions were investigated to affect the physicochemical properties, biomass, and extracellular polymer secretion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic biofilm. In addition, relative copy numbers of nine ARGs were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In the presence of CIP, microorganisms in the water and microplastic biofilm were more inclined to carry associated ARGs (2–3 times higher), which had a contributing effect on ARGs enrichment. The process of pre-microplastic biofilm formation might have an inhibitory effect on ARGs (total relative abundance up to 0.151) transfer and proliferation compared to the surrounding water (total relative abundance up to 0.488). However, in the presence of CIP stress, microplastic biofilm maintained the abundance of ARGs (from 0.151 to 0.149) better compared to the surrounding water (from 0.488 to 0.386). Therefore, microplastic biofilm act as abundance buffer island of ARGs stabilizing the concentration of ARGs. In addition, high-throughput analyses showed the presence of antibiotic-resistant (Pseudomonas) and pathogenic (Vibrio) microorganisms in biofilm under different conditions. The above research deepens our understanding of ARGs enrichment in biofilm and provides important insights into the ecological risks of interactions between ARGs, antibiotics, and microplastic biofilm.

GreenFILE,8gh,164356387,Plastic wastes and surface antibiotic resistance genes pollution in mangrove environments.,"Mangroves are located at the intersection of land and sea and are also heavily affected by plastic wastes. Biofilms of plastic wastes in mangroves are reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, plastic wastes and ARG pollution were investigated from three typical mangrove areas in Zhanjiang, South China. Transparent was the dominant colors of plastic wastes in three mangroves. Fragment and film shape accounted for 57.73–88.23% of plastic waste samples in mangroves. In addition, 39.50% of plastic wastes in protected area mangroves are PS. The metagenomic results shows that the 175 ARGs were found on plastic wastes of the three mangroves, the abundance accounting for 91.11% of the total ARGs. The abundance of Vibrio accounted for 2.31% of the total bacteria genera in aquaculture pond area mangrove. Correlation analysis shows that a microbe can carry multiple ARGs that may improve resistance to antibiotics. Microbes are the potential hosts of most ARGs, suggesting that ARGs can be transmitted by microbes. Because the mangroves are closely related to human activities and the high abundance of ARGs on plastic increases the ecological risks, people should improve plastic waste management and prevent the spread of ARGs by reducing plastic pollution.",20230601,"Sun, Ruikun ; Liu, Yu ; Li, Ting ; Qian, Zhong-Ji ; Zhou, Chunxia ; Hong, Pengzhi ; Sun, Shengli ; Li, Chengyong",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2023,true,Environmental Monitoring & Assessment,Waste management ; Pollution ; Plastic scrap ; Mangrove plants ; China ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Surface resistance,JOUR,,,0167-6369,,,,,eng,Springer Nature,13,1,13,195,6,10.1007/s10661-023-11312-8,,KSD,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=783824cf-985f-3ca5-8984-fc4466e2a910
GreenFILE,8gh,173698700,Incomplete degradation of aromatic–aliphatic copolymer leads to proliferation of microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes.,"[Display omitted] • Microplastics are released and accumulated during uncontrolled composting of biodegradable plastics. • Aromatic − aliphatic plastics serve as vectors and hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes. • The degradation of biodegradable plastics in compost needs to be enhanced to maintain compost quality. Biodegradable plastics (BDPs) have attracted extensive attention as an alternative to conventional plastics. BDPs could be mineralized by composting, while the quality of compost affected by the presence of BDPs and the residual microplastics (MPs) has not been well evaluated. This study aimed to explore the MPs release potential and environmental implications of commercial BDPs (aromatic−aliphatic copolymer) films in uncontrolled composting. Results showed that the molecular weight of BDPs decreased by >60% within 60 d. However, the non-extracted organic matter and wet-sieving measurements indicated that MPs continuously released and accumulated during regular composting. The average MPs release potential (0.1–5 mm) was 134.6 ± 18.1 particles/mg (BDPs), which resulted in 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> particles/g dw in compost. The plastisphere of MPs showed a significantly higher (0.95–16.76 times) abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which resulted in the rising (1.34–2.24 times) of ARGs in compost heaps, in comparison to the control groups.

GreenFILE,8gh,181491049,Shallow shotgun sequencing of healthcare waste reveals plastic-eating bacteria with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance genes.,"The burgeoning crises of antimicrobial resistance and plastic pollution are converging in healthcare settings, presenting a complex challenge to global health. This study investigates the microbial populations in healthcare waste to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance and the potential for plastic degradation by bacteria. Our metagenomic analysis, using both amplicon and shallow shotgun sequencing, provided a comprehensive view of the taxonomic diversity and functional capacity of the microbial consortia. The viable bacteria in healthcare waste samples were analyzed employing full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, revealing a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Notably, Proteus mirabilis VFC3/3 and Pseudomonas sp. VFA2/3 were detected, while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VFV3/2 surfaced as the predominant species, holding implications for the spread of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multidrug-resistant strains conferring antimicrobial genes, including the broad-spectrum antibiotic carbapenem, underscoring the critical need for improved waste management and infection control measures. Remarkably, we found genes linked to the breakdown of plastic that encoded for enzymes of the esterase, depolymerase, and oxidoreductase classes. This suggests that specific bacteria found in medical waste may be able to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that comes from biological and medical waste. The information is helpful in formulating strategies to counter the combined problems of environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring microbial communities in hospital waste in order to influence waste management procedures and public health policy. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance and plastic waste, especially in hospital settings where they intersect most acutely.

GreenFILE,8gh,134070446,Plastics in the marine environment are reservoirs for antibiotic and metal resistance genes.,"Abstract Plastics have been accumulated offshore and in the deep oceans at an unprecedented scale. Microbial communities have colonized the plastisphere, which has become a reservoir for both antibiotic and metal resistance genes (ARGs and MRGs). This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence of ARGs and MRGs, and their relationships within the microbial community, using metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database. The abundance of ARGs and MRGs in microbial communities on the plastics were in the ranges 7.07 × 10<sup>−4</sup>–1.21 × 10<sup>−2</sup> and 5.51 × 10<sup>−3</sup>–4.82 × 10<sup>−2</sup> copies per 16S rRNA, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of ARGs and MRGs in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of ARGs and MRGs in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant differences in the abundance or diversity of ARGs and MRGs between macroplastics biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition was the determining factor of the ARG profile but not for MRG. Some ARGs and MRGs had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • Plastic size does not influence the abundance and diversity of resistance genes. • Metal resistance genes had higher abundances than antibiotic resistance genes. • Plastics are a reservoir for metal resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes. • Bacterial community driving ARG composition but not for MRG profile • Flavobacteriaceae family bacteria are potential host for ARGs and MRGs.",20190201,"Yang, Yuyi ; Liu, Guihua ; Song, Wenjuan ; Ye, Chen ; Lin, Hui ; Li, Zan ; Liu, Wenzhi",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2019,true,Environment International,Plastic marine debris ; Microbial communities ; Metagenomics ; Metals ; Multidrug resistance,JOUR,,,0160-4120,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,86,79,8,123,,10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.061,,JQ0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a3391d87-d805-3f67-9296-e7c067c9085c
GreenFILE,8gh,181159827,Exposure to bisphenol compounds accelerates the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmid.,"Antimicrobial resistance poses the most formidable challenge to public health, with plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer playing a pivotal role in its global spread. Bisphenol compounds (BPs), a group of environmental contaminants with endocrine-disrupting properties, are extensively used in various plastic products and can be transmitted to food. However, the impact of BPs on the plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has not yet been elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate that BPs could promote the conjugative transfer frequency of RP4-7 and clinically multidrug-resistant plasmids. Furthermore, the promoting effect of BPs on the plasmid transfer was also confirmed in a murine model. Microbial diversity analysis of transconjugants indicated an increase in α diversity in the BPAF-treated group, along with the declined richness of some beneficial bacteria and elevated richness of Faecalibaculum rodentium , which might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. The underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced conjugative transfer upon BPAF treatment include exacerbated oxidative stress, disrupted membrane homeostasis, augmented energy metabolism, and the increased expression of conjugation-related genes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential risk associated with the exacerbated dissemination of AMR both in vitro and in vivo caused by BPs exposure. • BPs promote the conjugative transfer of resistance plasmids. • BPs enhance the spread of ARGs in a murine model. • Faecalibaculum rodentium might serve as an intermediate repository for resistance plasmids. • BPs exacerbate oxidative stress, disrupt membrane homeostasis and augment energy metabolism.",20241215,"Yang, Bingqing ; Sun, Jingyi ; Zhu, Shuyao ; Wang, Zhiqiang ; Liu, Yuan",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024:Part 1,true,Environmental Research,Pollutants ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microbial diversity ; Energy metabolism ; Bisphenol A,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,263,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.120002,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=5116734c-cf2b-3b42-9d91-65c1048c3d55
GreenFILE,8gh,181286929,Plastisphere in a low-pollution mountain river: Influence of microplastics on survival of pathogenic bacteria.,"Microplastics (MPs) are found even in remote and low-pollution freshwater ecosystems. However, the microbial communities associated with MPs in these environments remain poorly understood. We characterized the plastisphere in a low-pollution riverine ecosystem and evaluated the influence of different MPs in the persistence of pathogens in such environments. A mixture of MPs (MPs Mix) composed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was submerged at three locations (L1, L2 and L3) in the river. For comparison purposes, water and sand communities were also analyzed. Our results revealed distinct bacterial communities on MPs compared to those in water or on the natural substrate (sand). However, the resemblance between the plastisphere and communities on natural particles was higher than what has been reported for polluted ecosystems. Although pathogens were predominantly enriched in the water, a few genera (e.g. Acinetobacter , Legionella and Mycobacterium) were enriched in the plastisphere. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes did not differ significantly between water, sand, and MPs. The influence of different MPs (PE, PP, PET) on the persistence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (i.e. cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli and meropenem-resistant Enterobacter kobei) in unpolluted water was assessed in microcosms. Significant differences were observed between the microcosms with MPs and those with natural particles (sand), after a 36-day exposure. A significantly higher persistence of the pathogens was registered in microcosms with PE and PET. Our results provide new insights into the plastisphere in non-pollution environments and demonstrate that even in these settings, MPs can facilitate the survival and dissemination of pathogens. [Display omitted] • MPs host unique microbial communities in low-pollution rivers. • Plastisphere and sand communities were more similar than in polluted rivers. • Lower microbial risk associated to MPs in low-pollution rivers. • MPs boost antibiotic-resistant pathogens persistence in river water. • Plastic polymer type influences pathogens persistence in river water.",20241115,"Silva, Isabel ; Rodrigues, Elsa T. ; Tacão, Marta ; Henriques, Isabel",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2024,true,Chemosphere,Polyethylene terephthalate ; Biotic communities ; Bacterial communities ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Pathogenic bacteria,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,368,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143800,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e5b54f18-01a5-3f90-ab6b-46b948353901
GreenFILE,8gh,172043269,Microplastics enrichment characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens in landfill leachate.,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a pressing environmental issue for aquatic ecosystems. Landfill leachate is an important contributor of MPs and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). However, there are few studies on the colonization of ARGs and pathogens on MPs in leachate. This study conducted incubation experiments with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) MPs in landfill leachate which were about 3–5 years old (PL) and 5–10 years old (AL). After incubation, the bacterial cells colonized and grew on the surface of MPs, inducing the increase of oxygenated oxygen functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) on the MPs surface. Real-time PCR indicated that MPs selectively enriched ARGs, such as genes tetM , tetC , mcr-1 , aac(6′)-Ib-cr , blaTEM and blaSHV in leachate. The diversity of bacterial communities on MPs was significantly increased in AL leachate, but decreased in PL leachate. The differences in bacterial communities in MPs biofilms were related to the type of MPs. Compared with AL leachate, the abundance of Chloroflexi increased by 15.7% on the PET, and the abundance of Acidobacteriota increased by 6.23 fold on the PP. The abundance of Firmicutes increased from 20.7% in PL leachate to 65.8% and 60.7% on PET and PP, respectively. Additionally, pathogens were observed to be more abundant on MPs compared to leachate. In particular, pathogens (Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Enterobacter and Rhodococcus) associated with sul1 and sul2 were generally present at higher levels on MPs than in the surrounding leachate. These results provide significant implications for understanding the health risk of MPs in the environment. [Display omitted] • MPs surface possessed more oxygen-containing functional groups in leachate. • ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs and had a high horizontal transfer ability. • MPs surface had a specific microbial community in different leachates. • MPs enriched pathogens in leachates. • Pathogens on MPs were closely associated with ARGs.",20231115,"Qiu, Cheng ; Zhou, Yiwei ; Wang, Hua ; Chu, Yixuan ; Zheng, Lei ; Chen, Yongmin ; Song, Yali ; Fang, Chengran",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2023,true,Chemosphere,Leachate ; Landfills ; Plastic marine debris ; Polyethylene terephthalate ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,341,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140100,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=213fe25b-06be-3b67-a275-9e90b66f156f
GreenFILE,8gh,175524255,Beach sand plastispheres are hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes and potentially pathogenic bacteria even in beaches with good water quality.,"Massive amounts of microplastics are transported daily from the oceans and rivers onto beaches. The ocean plastisphere is a hotspot and a vector for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the plastisphere in beach sand. Thus, to describe whether the microplastics from beach sand represent a risk to human health, we evaluated the bacteriome and abundance of ARGs on microplastic and sand sampled at the drift line and supralittoral zones of four beaches of poor and good water quality. The bacteriome was evaluated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, and the ARGs and bacterial abundances were evaluated by high-throughput real-time PCR. The results revealed that the microplastic harbored a bacterial community that is more abundant and distinct from that of beach sand, as well as a greater abundance of potential human and marine pathogens, especially the microplastics deposited closer to seawater. Microplastics also harbored a greater number and abundance of ARGs. All antibiotic classes evaluated were found in the microplastic samples, but not in the beach sand ones. Additionally, 16 ARGs were found on the microplastic alone, including genes related to multidrug resistance (blaKPC , blaCTX-M , tetM , mdtE and acrB_1) , genes that have the potential to rapidly and horizontally spread (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, and tetM), and the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics that are typically regarded as the ultimate line of defense against severe multi-resistant bacterial infections (blaKPC). Lastly, microplastic harbored a similar bacterial community and ARGs regardless of beach water quality. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of microplastics in beach sand worldwide may constitute a potential threat to human health, even in beaches where the water quality is deemed satisfactory. This phenomenon may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs. [Display omitted] • ARGs are more prevalent and abundant on microplastics than in beach sand. • Genes related to multidrug resistance were found exclusively on the microplastic. • Beach microplastics may harbor blaKPC, the gene for last-resort antibiotic resistance. • Microplastics in sand may pose health risks, regardless of water quality of the beach. • Microplastic deposited closer to seawater appears to pose a greater health risk.",20240301,"Magalhães, Emily Amorim ; de Jesus, Hugo Emiliano ; Pereira, Pedro Henrique Freitas ; Gomes, Abílio Soares ; Santos, Henrique Fragoso dos",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Environmental Pollution,Water quality ; Beaches ; Anthropogenic effects on nature ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Multidrug resistance ; Pathogenic bacteria,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,344,,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.123237,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=00830a6b-44b1-3473-aba8-9ba25f913179
GreenFILE,8gh,177630680,Entry pathways determined the effects of MPs on sludge anaerobic digestion system: The views of methane production and antibiotic resistance genes fates.,"Sludge is one of the primary reservoirs of microplastics (MPs), and the effects of MPs on subsequent sludge treatment raised attention. Given the entry pathways, MPs would exhibit different properties, but the entry pathway-dependent effect of MPs on sludge treatment performance and the fates of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), another high-risk emerging contaminant, were seldom documented. Herein, MPs with two predominant entry pathways, including wastewater-derived (WW-derived) and anaerobic digestion-introduced (AD-introduced), were used to investigate the effects on AD performance and ARGs abundances. The results indicated that WW-derived MPs, namely the MPs accumulated in sludge during the wastewater treatment process, exhibited significant inhibition on methane production by 22.8%–71.6%, while the AD-introduced MPs, being introduced in the sludge AD process, slightly increased the methane yield by 4.7%–17.1%. Meanwhile, MPs were responsible for promoting transmission of target ARGs, and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) showed a greater promotion effect (0.0154–0.0936) than polyamide MPs (PA-MPs) (0.0013–0.0724). Compared to size, entry pathways and types played more vital roles on MPs influences. Investigation on mechanisms based on microbial community structure revealed characteristics (aging degree and types) of MPs determined the differences of AD performance and ARGs fates. WW-derived MPs with longer aging period and higher aging degree would release toxics and decrease the activities of microorganisms, resulting in the negative impact on AD performance. However, AD-introduced MPs with short aging period exhibited marginal impacts on AD performance. Furthermore, the co-occurrent network analysis suggested that the variations of potential host bacteria induced by MPs with different types and aging degree attributed to the dissemination of ARGs. Distinctively from most previous studies, the MPs with different sizes did not show remarkable effects on AD performance and ARGs fates. Our findings benefited the understanding of realistic environmental behavior and effect of MPs with different sources. [Display omitted] • WW-derived microplastics inhibited methane yield while AD-introduced showed reverse impacts. • WW-derived microplastics increased abundances of antibiotics resistance genes than AD-introduced microplastics. • Microbial activity was severe inhibited by WW-derived microplastics. • Impacts on anaerobic digestion performance and antibiotics resistance genes fate were determined by types and entry pathways.",20240715,"Wang, Xueting ; Huang, Guangchen ; Chen, Qirui ; Pang, Ruirui ; Han, Zhibang ; Zhu, Jundong ; Xie, Bing ; Su, Yinglong ; Zhou, Shuai",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2024:Part 3,true,Environmental Research,Methane as fuel ; Sewage sludge digestion ; Anaerobic digestion ; Methane ; Wastewater treatment ; Sludge management ; Plastic marine debris ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,252,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.119061,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6298f015-f3cd-3403-b914-ec5de1facd4a
GreenFILE,8gh,164402035,New insight into the effect of microplastics on antibiotic resistance and bacterial community of biofilm.,"Microplastics (MPs) could serve as substrates for microbial colonization and biofilm formation. However, research on the effects of different types of microplastics and natural substrates on biofilm formation and community structure in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) is limited. In this study, we employed by means of microcosm experiments to analyze the situation of biofilms conditions, bacterial resistance patterns, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) distribution, and bacterial community on different substrates using microbial cultivation, high throughtput sequencing and PCR. The result showed that biofilms on different substrates markedly increased with time, with MPs surfaces formed more biofilm than stone. Analyses of antibiotic resistant showed negligible differences in the resistance rate to the same antibiotic at 30 d, but tet B would be selectively enriched on PP and PET. The microbial communities associated with biofilms on MPs and stones exhibited variations during different stages of formation. Notably, phylum WPS-2 and Epsilonbacteraeota were identified as the dominant microbiomes of biofilms on MPs and stones at 30 d, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that WPS-2 could potentially be a tetracycline-resistant bacterium, while Epsilonbacteraeota did not correlate with any detected ARB. Our results emphasized the potential threat posed by MPs as attachment carriers for bacteria, particularly ARB, in aquatic environments.

However, the impacts and potential mechanisms of NPs on the fate of ARGs in activated sludge are not fully understood. Herein, we used metagenomic approach to investigate the responses of ARGs, host bacteria, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and functional genes to polystyrene (PS) NPs at environmentally relevant (0.5 mg/L) and high stress concentrations (50 mg/L) in activated sludge. The results showed that 0.5 and 50 mg/L PS NPs increased the relative abundance of ARGs in the activated sludge by 58.68% and 46.52%, respectively (p < 0.05). Host tracking analysis elucidated that the hosts of ARGs were significantly enriched by PS NPs (p < 0.05), with Proteobacteria being the predominant host bacteria. Additionally, the occurrence of new ARGs hosts and the enrichment of MGEs and functional genes (i.e., genes related to SOS response, cell membrane permeability, and secretion system, etc.) indicated that PS NPs promoted horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. Finally, path modeling analysis revealed that the proliferation of ARGs caused by PS NPs was primarily attributed to the enhancement of HGT and the enrichment of host bacteria. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the spread risk of ARGs in activated sludge under NPs pollution. [Display omitted] • First metagenomic insight into the effect of PS NPs on ARGs fate in sludge was reported. • Environmental concentration of PS NPs notably improved the abundance of ARGs in sludge. • Host bacteria of ARGs, especially Proteobacteria , were remarkably enriched by PS NPs. • The proliferation of ARGs under PS NPs stress mainly depended on the host bacteria and HGT.",20241215,"Song, Jian ; Huang, Zefeng ; Gao, Yuanyuan ; Wang, Weigang ; Guo, Gang ; Duan, Yi ; Zhou, Shuai ; Tang, Zhenping",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024:Part 2,true,Environmental Pollution,Emerging contaminants ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Mobile genetic elements ; Stress concentration ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,363,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125260,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=c68255b4-b128-3918-90f0-28ee0455d0b4

Thus, the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics has caused another global problem for the environment and human health. Therefore, we focused on the current knowledge in the field of the co-occurrence of plastics and antibiotics to summarize the available studies. In this review, categorization of the topics, contaminants details, such as polymer type, size and source, antibiotic type, and other experimental parameters were summarized and discussed. This study indicated that the sorption of antibiotics on plastics, antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of plastics, and antibiotic resistance gene onto plastics were the most frequently examined categories in this field. Moreover, the variability in the procedures and the processes, and the heterogeneity data of reporting between different studies on similar topic make it difficult to bring all results together and produce a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge.

The counts of cultivable ARB in microplastic samples were 6.40 × 10<sup>6</sup>–2.48 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/g, which were 100–5000 times higher than those in water samples. The ratios of cultivable ARB to total cultivable bacteria from microplastic samples were higher than those from water samples. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and abundance of cultivable ARB in the microplastic samples was high with the predominant bacterial genera of Vibrio, Muricauda and Ruegeria. Total 160 MARB isolates were obtained and most of isolates were obtained from the microplastic samples. MARB isolates resisting or intermediating to four and three antibiotics accounted for much higher proportions in the microplastic samples, and the higher percentage of antibiotic resistance was to penicillin, sulfafurazole, erythromycin and tetracycline. The dominant multiple antibiotic resistance profile was TET-SFX-ERY-PEN, which accounted for 25.4% in microplastic samples and 23.9% in water samples. In typical MARB isolates, the positive detection rate of ARGs was up to 80.0% in microplastic samples while that was 65.3% in water samples. Five types of class 1 integrons (intI 1) associated gene cassette arrays and seven types of gene cassettes were detected in microplastic samples, which were more than those in water samples. These results revealed that microplastics were hazardous pollutants for the enrichment of ARB, especially superbugs, and the spread of antibiotic resistance.

GreenFILE,8gh,160540241,Tracking antibiotic resistance genes in microplastic-contaminated soil.,"Agricultural soils and microplastics (MPs) are hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Plastic mulch is the most important source of MPs in agricultural soil. ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and their host profiles in long-term mulch MP-exposed soils remain unclear. In the present study, metagenomics was used to investigate the distribution patterns of ARGs and MGEs in eight Chinese provinces with a long history of plastic mulch use. A total of 204 subtypes of ARGs and thousands of MGEs (14 integrons, 28 insertions, and 2993 plasmids) were identified. A similar diversity of ARGs was found among MPs film-contaminated sites. The types of ARGs with a high abundance were more concentrated, and multidrug resistance genes were the dominant ARGs. Soils from regions with a longer history of plastic film use (such as Xinjiang province) had a higher abundance of ARGs and MGEs. The distribution of ARGs and MGEs exhibited a modular network distribution pattern. A total of 27 ARG subtypes and 29 MGEs showed co-occurrence network relationships. More than 10 common hosts of ARGs and MGEs, such as Pseudomonas , were found, and their abundances were highest in three provinces, including Xinjiang. This study may help elucidate the impact mechanism of long-term MP residues on the occurrence and spread of ARGs in soil.

GreenFILE,8gh,159493695,Watershed urbanization enhances the enrichment of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes on microplastics in the water environment.,"Microplastics (MPs) serve as vectors for microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and contribute to the spread of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs across various environments. Patterns of microbial communities and ARGs in the biofilm on the surface of MPs, also termed as plastisphere, have become an issue of global concern. Although antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere has been detected, how watershed urbanization affects patterns of potential pathogens and ARGs in the microplastic biofilms is still unclear. Here, we compared the bacterial communities, the interaction between bacterial taxa, pathogenic bacteria, and ARGs between the plastisphere and their surrounding water, and revealed the extensive influence of urbanization on them. Our results showed that bacterial communities and interactions in the plastisphere differed from those in their surrounding water. Microplastics selectively enriched Bacteroidetes from water. In non-urbanized area, the abundance of Oxyphotobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than that in water, while α-Proteobacteria was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in plastisphere than those in water of urbanized area. Pathogenic bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the urbanized area than those in non-urbanized area. MPs selectively enriched ARG-carrying potential pathogens, i.e. , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae , and exhibited a distinct effect on the relative abundance of ARG and pathogens in water with different urbanization levels. We further found ARGs were significantly correlated to MGEs and pathogenic bacteria. These results suggested that MPs would promote the dissemination of ARGs among microbes including pathogenic bacteria, and urbanization would affect the impact of MPs on microbes, pathogens, and ARGs in water. A high level of urbanization could enhance the enrichment of pathogens and ARGs by MPs in aquatic systems and increase microbial risk in aquatic environments. Our findings highlighted the necessity of controlling the spread of ARGs among pathogens and the usage of plastic products in ecosystems of urban areas. [Display omitted] • Differences in bacterial communities are detected between plastisphere and water. • Differences in ARG profiles are determined between plastisphere and water. • Urbanization level would affect the impact of microplastics on pathogens and ARGs. • Urbanization enhances the enrichment of pathogens and ARGs in the plastisphere. • MPs and urbanization increase the risk induced by pathogens and ARGs in water.",20221115,"Li, Hu ; Luo, Qiuping ; Zhao, Sha ; Zhao, Peiqiang ; Yang, Xiaoru ; Huang, Qiansheng ; Su, Jianqiang",Article,Academic Journal,Nov2022,true,Environmental Pollution,Urban ecology ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Drug resistance in microorganisms ; Mobile genetic elements ; Enterobacter cloacae ; Pathogenic bacteria,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,313,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120185,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2cc29179-e10b-3dcc-b290-8c3f10fd6ff5
GreenFILE,8gh,161081031,Effects comparison between the secondary nanoplastics released from biodegradable and conventional plastics on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have caused widespread concern because of their potential harm to environmental safety and human health. As substitutes for conventional plastics, the toxic effects of short-term degradation products of biodegradable plastics (polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)) on bacteria and their impact on ARGs transfer were the focus of this study. After 60 days of degradation, more secondary nanoplastics were released from the biodegradable plastics PLA and PHA than that from the conventional plastics polystyrene (PS). All kinds of nanoplastics, no matter released from biodegradable plastics or conventional plastics, had no significant toxicity to bacteria. Nanoplastic particles from biodegradable plastics could significantly increase the transfer efficiency of ARGs. Although the amount of secondary nanoplastics produced by PHA microplastics was much higher than that of PLA, the transfer frequency after exposure to PLA was much higher, which may be due to the agglomeration of PHA nanoplastics caused by plastic instability in solution. After exposure to the 60 d PLA nanoplastics, the transfer frequency was the highest, which was approximately 28 times higher than that of control. The biodegradable nanoplastics significantly enhanced the expression of the outer membrane pore protein genes omp A and omp C, which could increase cell membrane permeability. The expression levels of trf Ap and trb Bp were increased by repressed major global regulatory genes kor A, kor B, and trb A, which eventually led to an increase in conjugative transfer frequency. This study provides important insights into the evaluation of the environmental and health risks caused by secondary nanoplastics released from biodegradable plastics. [Display omitted] • After 60 d degradation, secondary nanoplastics had no significant toxicity to bacteria. • Biodegradable nanoplastics could promote the transfer of ARGs between bacteria. • PS nanoplastics had no significant effect on the transfer of ARGs between bacteria. • The short-term biological effect of biodegradable plastics could not be neglected.",20230115,"Liu, Xiaomei ; Wang, Xiaolong ; Wang, RenJun ; Guo, Saisai ; Ahmad, Shakeel ; Song, Yuhao ; Gao, Peike ; Chen, Junfeng ; Liu, Chunchen ; Ding, Ning",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Biodegradable plastics ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Bacterial genes ; Polylactic acid ; Regulator genes ; Cell membranes ; Thermal instability,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,317,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120680,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2ae197c0-00b8-3e3b-9f14-915b8ecf8462
GreenFILE,8gh,178941462,The resistance change and stress response mechanisms of chlorine-resistant bacteria under microplastic stress in drinking water distribution system.,"The presence of both chlorine-resistant bacteria (CRB) and microplastics (MPs) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) poses a threat to water quality and human health. However, the risk of CRB bio evolution under the stress of MPs remains unclear. In this study, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were selected to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and it was clear that MPs had the risk of carrying pollutants into DWDS and releasing them. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility test and disinfection experiment confirmed that MPs could enhance the resistance of CRB to antibiotics and disinfectants. Bacteria epigenetic resistance mechanisms were approached from multiple perspectives, including physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as molecular regulatory networks. When MPs enter DWDS, CRB could attach to the surface of MPs and directly interact with both MPs and the antibiotics they release. This attachment process promoted changes in the composition and content of extracellular polymers (EPS) within cells, enhanced surface hydrophobicity, stimulated oxidative stress function, and notably elevated the relative abundance of certain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study elucidates the mechanism by which MPs alter the intrinsic properties of CRB, providing valuable insights into the effective avoidance of biological risks to water quality during CRB evolution. [Display omitted] • Chlorine disinfection was deteriorated by the presence of MPs. • MPs contributed to the upregulation of multi-antibiotic resistance genes in CRB. • Oxidative stress response was triggered by MPs.",20240901,"Zhang, Jingna ; Ma, Wencheng ; Li, Yibing ; Zhong, Dan ; Zhou, Ziyi ; Ma, Jun",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2024,true,Environmental Pollution,Water quality ; Water distribution ; Drinking water ; Microbial sensitivity tests ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,356,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124331,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=8bd5ce21-6e35-3eca-8294-5831d961f2ff
GreenFILE,8gh,179709177,Impact of polystyrene nanoplastics on primary sludge fermentation under acidic and alkaline conditions: Significance of antibiotic resistance genes.,"As a part of industrial or commercial discharge, the influx of nanoplastics (NPs) to the wastewater treatment plants is inevitable. Consequently, it has become a must to understand the effects of these NPs on different unit processes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of three different concentrations of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) on the fermentation of primary sludge (PrS), implemented in batch anaerobic bioreactors, at pH 5 and 10, considering the pH-dependent nature of the fermentation process. The results showed that PsNPs stimulated hydrogen gas production at a lower dose (50 μg/L), while a significant gas suppression was denoted at higher concentrations (150 μg/L, 250 μg/L). In both acidic and alkaline conditions, propionic and acetic acid predominated, respectively, followed by n-butyric acid. Under both acidic and alkaline conditions, exposure to PsNPs boosted the propagation of various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including tetracycline, macrolide, β-lactam and sulfonamide resistance genes, and integrons. Notably, under alkaline condition, the abundance of sul 2 gene in the 250 μg PsNPs/L batch exhibited a 2.4-fold decrease compared to the control batch. The response of the microbial community to PsNPs exposure exhibited variations at different pH values. Bacteroidetes prevailed at both pH conditions, with their relative abundance increasing after PsNPs exposure, indicating a positive impact of PsNPs on PrS solubilization. Adverse impacts, however, were detected in Firmicutes , Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria. The observed variations in the survival rates of various microbes stipulate that they do not have the same tolerance levels under different pH conditions. [Display omitted] • PsNPs exposure up to 250 μg/L did not hinder VFA production in sludge fermentation. • Composition of VFAs varied by different pH levels rather than PsNPs levels. • PsNPs enhanced the proliferation of most antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). • Dominant ARGs varied by different pH levels.",20240915,"Saila, Romana ; Zakaria, Basem S. ; Mirsoleimani Azizi, Seyed Mohammad ; Mostafa, Alsayed ; Dhar, Bipro Ranjan",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2024,true,Chemosphere,Sewage disposal plants ; Anaerobic reactors ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Propionic acid ; Acetic acid,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,364,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142777,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e37313d2-a94d-3239-8d18-479edcab68c5
GreenFILE,8gh,150008723,Are microplastic particles a hotspot for the spread and the persistence of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems?,"In the last decade, the study of the origin and fate of plastic debris received great attention, leading to a new and broad awareness of the hazard represented by these particles for the environment and the biota. At the same time, the scientific consideration on the leading role of the environment regarding the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) increased. Both, microplastic particles (MPs) and ARB share pollution sources and, in aquatic systems, MPs could act as a novel ecological niche, favouring the survival of pathogens and ARB. MPs can host a specific microbial biofilm, referred to as plastisphere , phylogenetically different from the surrounding planktonic microbial community and from the biofilm growing on other suspended particles. The plastisphere can influence the overall microbiome of a specific habitat, by introducing and supporting different species and by increasing horizontal gene transfer. In this review we collect and analyse the available studies coupling MPs and antibiotic resistance in water, highlighting knowledge gaps to be filled in order to understand if MPs could effectively act as a carrier of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes, and pose a real threat to human health. [Display omitted] • Plastisphere accumulates antibiotic resistance genes and resistant bacteria. • Sulfonamide resistant genes are commonly found on MPs. • MPs persist in the aquatic environment favouring the spread of resistances. • Methodological advances are needed to finely characterize the plastisphere resistome. • Plastisphere resistome in freshwater and sediment is still largely unexplored.

Microplastic (MP) pollution is a rapidly growing global environmental concern that has led to the emergence of a new environmental compartment, the plastisphere, which is a hotspot for the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human bacterial pathogens (HBPs). However, studies on the effects of long-term organic fertilizer application on the dispersal of ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the plastisphere of farmland soil have been limited. Here, we performed a field culture experiment by burying nylon bags filled with MPs in paddy soil that had been treated with different fertilizers for over 30 years to explore the changes of ARGs and VFGs in soil plastisphere. Our results show that the soil plastisphere amplified the ARG and VFG pollution caused by organic fertilization by 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively. And it also led to a 2.7-fold increase in the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Meanwhile, the plastisphere tended to promote deterministic process in the community assembly of HBPs, with an increase of 1.4 times. Network analysis found a significant correlation between ARGs, VFGs, and bacteria in plastisphere. Correlation analysis highlight the important role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in shaping the abundance of ARGs and VFGs, respectively.

GreenFILE,8gh,181060777,Microplastic and antibiotics in waters: Interactions and environmental risks.,"Antibiotics (ATs) are ubiquitously detected in natural waters worldwide, and their tendency to co-migrate with microplastics (MPs) post-adsorption leads to heightened environmental risk. Research on the adsorption of ATs on MPs and their subsequent effects on the environmental risks is gaining significant attention globally. This adsorption process predominantly occurs through hydrophobic forces, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions and is influenced by various environmental factors. The interaction between MPs and ATs exhibited varying degrees of efficiency across different pH levels and ionic strengths. Furthermore, this paper outlines the environmental risks associated with the co-presence of MPs and ATs in aquatic environments, emphasizing the potential effect of MPs on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and related environmental risks. The potential hazards posed by MPs and ATs in aquatic systems warrant serious consideration. Future research should concentrate on the adsorption of ATs/ARGs on MPs under real environmental conditions, horizontal gene transfer on MPs, as well as biofilm formation and agglomeration behavior on MPs that needs to be emphasized.

GreenFILE,8gh,153323617,Bioplastic accumulates antibiotic and metal resistance genes in coastal marine sediments.,"The oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic debris, and several studies have implicated plastic as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bioplastic is widely regarded as an environmentally friendly replacement to conventional petroleum-based plastic, but the effects of bioplastic pollution on marine environments remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first evidence that bioplastic accumulates antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in marine sediments. Biofilms fouling ceramic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) were investigated by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Four ARG groups were more abundant in PHA: trimethoprim resistance (TMP), multidrug resistance (MDR), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance (MLS), and polymyxin resistance (PMR). One MRG group was more abundant in PHA: multimetal resistance (MMR). The relative abundance of ARGs and MRGs were strongly correlated based on a Mantel test between the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices (R = 0.97, p < 0.05) and a Pearson's analysis (R = 0.96, p < 0.05). ARGs were detected in more than 40% of the 57 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) while MRGs were detected in more than 90% of the MAGs. Further investigation (e.g., culturing, genome sequencing, antibiotic susceptibility testing) revealed that PHA biofilms were colonized by hemolytic Bacillus cereus group bacteria that were resistant to beta-lactams, vancomycin, and bacitracin. Taken together, our findings indicate that bioplastic, like conventional petroleum-based plastic, is a reservoir for resistance genes and a potential vector for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in coastal marine sediments. • Bioplastic accumulates antibiotic and metal resistance genes in marine sediments • Four ARG groups and one MRG group were more abundant in bioplastic biofilms • Abundance of ARGs and MRGs in bioplastic biofilms significantly correlated • Bioplastic colonized by B. cereus bacteria resistant to three antibiotic classes",20211215,"Di Cesare, Andrea ; Pinnell, Lee J. ; Brambilla, Diego ; Elli, Giulia ; Sabatino, Raffaella ; Sathicq, María B. ; Corno, Gianluca ; O'Donnell, Colin ; Turner, Jeffrey W.",Abstract,Academic Journal,Dec2021,,Environmental Pollution,Marine sediments ; Coastal sediments ; Antibiotics ; Marine pollution ; Beta lactam antibiotics ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microbial sensitivity tests ; Multidrug resistance,ABST,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,291,,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118161,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f0bff411-82fc-3c19-8933-89df0721516c

Linking microplastics (MPs) and AMR is particularly concerning as MPs pollution would have significant ramifications on controlling of AMR; however, the effects of MPs on the spread and genetic mechanisms of AMR bacteria remain unclear. Herein, we performed Simonsen end-point conjugation to investigate the impact of four commonly used MPs on transfer of clinically relevant plasmids. The transfer breadth of a representative pA/C_MCR-8 plasmid across bacterial communities was confirmed by the cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our study shows that exposure to four commonly found MPs promotes the conjugation rates of four clinically relevant AMR plasmids by up to 200-fold, when compared to the non-exposed group and that the transfer rates are MP concentrations demonstrate a positive correlation with higher transfer rates. Furthermore, we show that MPs induce the expression of plasmid-borne conjugal genes and SOS-linked genes such as recA , lexA , dinB and dinD. High-throughput sequencing of the broad transmission of plasmid pA/C_MCR-8, shows distribution over two main phyla, Pseudomonadota (50.0 %-95.0 %) and Bacillota (0.4 %-2.0 %).

In this study, we evaluated the abundance of faecal and marine bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from biofilms adhered to marine plastics. Floating plastics and plastics from sediments were collected in coastal areas impacted by human faecal pollution in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Culture and/or molecular methods were used to quantify faecal indicators (E. coli , Enterococci and crAssphage), and the ARGs sul I, tet W and bla TEM and the 16S rRNA were detected by qPCR assays. Pseudomonas and Vibrio species and heterotrophic marine bacteria were also analysed via culture-based methods. Results showed that, plastic particles covered by bacterial biofilms, primarily consisted of marine bacteria including Vibrio spp. Some floating plastics had a low concentration of viable E. coli and Enterococci (42% and 67% of the plastics respectively). Considering the median area of the plastics, we detected an average of 68 cfu E. coli per item, while a higher concentration of E. coli was detected on individual plastic items, when compared with 100 ml of the surrounding water. Using qPCR, we quantified higher values of faecal indicators which included inactive and dead microorganisms, detecting up to 2.6 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc mm<sup>−2</sup>. The ARGs were detected in 67–88% of the floating plastics and in 29–57% of the sediment plastics with a concentration of up to 6.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc mm<sup>−2</sup>. Furthermore, enrichment of these genes was observed in biofilms compared with the surrounding water. These results show that floating plastics act as a conduit for both the attachment and transport of faecal microorganisms. In contrast, low presence of faecal indicators was detected in plastic from seafloor sediments. Therefore, although in low concentrations, faecal bacteria, and potential pathogens, were identified in marine plastics, further suggesting plastics act as a reservoir of pathogens and ARGs.

Here, in the presence of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) and polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs), the nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect and sludge structure performance were affected in an anaerobic–anoxic–aerobic system, a typical biological leachate treatment process. The abundance of tetracycline-resistance genes (tet genes) in biofilms on the two types of MP was significantly higher than that in the leachate and sludge, and the load on PE-MPs was higher than that on PS-MPs because of the porous structure of PE-MPs. Aging of the MPs increased their surface roughness and abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and shaped the profile of ARGs in the MP biofilms. The biofilm biomass and growth rate on the two types of MP increased with the incubation time in the first 30 days, and was affected by environmental factors. Structural equation models and co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that the MPs indirectly affected the spectrum of ARGs by affecting biofilm formation, and, to a lesser extent, had a direct impact on the selective enrichment of ARGs. We discuss the mechanisms of the relationships between MPs and ARGs in the leachate treatment system, which will have guiding significance for future research. Our data on the colonization of microorganisms and tet genes in MPs biofilms provide new evidence concerning the accumulation and transmission of these ARGs, and are important for understanding the mechanisms of MPs in spreading pollution.

Here, we measured the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the seawater and microplastic biofilms. Results showed that microbial biofilms were formed on the surface of microplastics. The alpha diversity of the bacterial community in the microplastic biofilms was lower than that in the seawater, and the bacterial communities were distinct between the two. Further analysis revealed that several bacteria in the microplastic biofilms carried ARGs, and the proportion of which was correlated to the concentration of antibiotics in the seawater. Specifically, Vibrio was positively correlated to sul1 in the microplastic biofilms under higher concentrations of sulfonamides. Pathway analysis reflected significant overrepresentation of human disease related pathways in the bacterial community of microplastic biofilms. These results suggest that the microplastic biofilms could selectively enrich bacteria from the reef environments, causing the development of ARGs under antibiotic driving.

The effects of polystyrene microplastics of different particle sizes on the accumulation of triclosan in the gut of Xenopus tropicalis , its toxic effects, and the transmission of resistance genes were evaluated. The results showed that co-exposure to polystyrene (PS-MPs) adsorbed with triclosan (TCS) caused the accumulation of triclosan in the intestine with the following accumulation capacity: TCS + 5 µm PS group > TCS group > TCS + 20 µm PS group > TCS + 0.1 µm PS group. All experimental groups showed increased intestinal inflammation and antioxidant enzyme activity after 28 days of exposure to PS-MPs and TCS of different particle sizes. The TCS + 20 µm PS group exhibited the highest upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL- 10, IL -1β). The TCS + 20 µm group showed the highest increase in enzyme activity compared to the control group. PS-MPs and TCS, either alone or together, altered the composition of the intestinal microbial community. In addition, the presence of more antibiotic resistance genes than triclosan resistance genes significantly increased the expression of tetracycline resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes, which may be associated with the development of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. This study refines the aquatic ecotoxicity assessment of TCS adsorbed by MPs and provides informative information for the management and control of microplastics and non-antibiotic bacterial inhibitors.

Although the microbial structure and composition of biofilm have been studied, the knowledge of its microbial function and ecological risk is still limited. In this study, we investigated how the surface properties of MPs affect the biofilm communities and metabolic features under different environmental conditions, and explored the biofilm enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results showed that the incubation time, habitat and MPs aging state significantly influenced the structure and composition of biofilm microbial communities, and a small amount of pathogens have been found in the MPs-attached biofilm. The microbial carbon utilization capacity of the biofilm in different incubation habitats varies greatly with highest metabolism capacity appear in the river.

This study investigated variations in ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and host bacteria during AD under the pressure of polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). The results showed that the MPs increased methane production by 11.7–35.5%, and decreased ARG abundance by 5.6–24.6%. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease of MGEs (plasmid, prophage, etc.) promoted the decrease of the abundance of multidrug, aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes. Metagenomic annotation revealed that the reduction of key host bacteria (Arenimonas , Lautropia , etc.) reduced the abundance of major ARGs (rsmA , rpoB2 , etc.). Moreover, PP MPs contributed to a reduction in the abundance of functional genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species, ATP synthesis, and cell membrane permeability, which was conducive to reducing the potential for horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.

GreenFILE,8gh,181194068,Antibiotic resistance in urban soils: Dynamics and mitigation strategies.,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a critical global health issue with significant clinical and economic implications. AR occurs when microorganisms develop mechanisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the risk of mortality and healthcare costs. While the connection between antibiotic use in clinical and agricultural settings and the emergence of AR is well-established, the role of urban soils as reservoirs and spreaders of AR is underexplored. This review examines the complex dynamics of AR in urban soils, highlighting the various sources of antibiotics, including domestic wastewater, industrial effluents, urban agricultural practices, but also microplastics and domestic animal excrements. The selective pressure exerted by these anthropogenic sources promotes the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly through horizontal gene transfer, which facilitates the transmission of resistance genes among soil microorganisms in urban environments. About that, the presence of antibiotics in urban soils poses a significant threat to public health by potentially transferring resistance genes to human pathogens through multiple pathways, including direct contact, food consumption, and water ingestion. Furthermore, AR in urban soils disrupts microbial community dynamics, impacting soil fertility, plant growth, and overall environmental quality. Therefore, this review aims to address gaps in understanding AR in urban soils, offering insights into its implications for human health and ecosystem integrity. By identifying these gaps and suggesting evidence-based strategies, this review proposes valid and sustainable solutions to mitigate and counteract the spread of AR in urban environments.",20241220,"Gentile, Annamaria ; Di Stasio, Luca ; Oliva, Gianmaria ; Vigliotta, Giovanni ; Cicatelli, Angela ; Guarino, Francesco ; Nissim, Werther Guidi ; Labra, Massimo ; Castiglione, Stefano",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024:Part 2,true,Environmental Research,Urban soils ; Agriculture ; Sewage ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,263,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.120120,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=1bc341f2-d18a-3134-912d-3279676badc1
GreenFILE,8gh,177907865,A review focusing on mechanisms and ecological risks of enrichment and propagation of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements by microplastic biofilms.,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging ubiquitous pollutants in aquatic environment and have received extensive global attention. In addition to the traditional studies related to the toxicity of MPs and their carrier effects, their unique surface-induced biofilm formation also increases the ecotoxicity potential of MPs from multiple perspectives. In this review, the ecological risks of MPs biofilms were summarized and assessed in detail from several aspects, including the formation and factors affecting the development of MPs biofilms, the selective enrichment and propagation mechanisms of current pollution status of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MPs biofilms, the dominant bacterial communities in MPs biofilms, as well as the potential risks of ARGs and MGEs transferring from MPs biofilms to aquatic organisms. On this basis, this paper also put forward the inadequacy and prospects of the current research and revealed that the MGEs-mediated ARG propagation on MPs under actual environmental conditions and the ecological risk of the transmission of ARGs and MGEs to aquatic organisms and human beings are hot spots for future research. Relevant research from the perspective of MPs biofilm should be carried out as soon as possible to provide support for the ecological pollution prevention and control of MPs.

GreenFILE,8gh,180995528,Effects of microplastics on dissipation of oxytetracycline and its relevant resistance genes in soil without and with Serratia marcescens: Comparison between biodegradable and conventional microplastics.,"The biodegradable (polybutylene adipate terephthalate: PBAT) and conventional (polyethylene: PE) microplastics (MPs) at 0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 % dosages (w/w) were added into soils with and without Serratia marcescens ZY01 (ZY01, a tet -host strain) to understand their different effects on the dissipation of oxytetracycline (OTC) and tet. The results showed that the dosages of PBAT MP exhibited different inhibition degrees of OTC biodegradation in soils regardless of ZY01, while the dosages of PE MP did not change the enhancement degree of OTC biodegradation in soils without ZY01. These differences were due to the higher adsorption capacity of OTC on PBAT MP and the stronger toxicity of PBAT MP to microorganisms. Besides soil organic matter, pH and total phosphorus were important factors regulating specific tet -host bacteria in soils with MPs (e.g., the nitrogen-cycling bacteria Steroidobacter and Nitrospira) and MPs + ZY01 (e.g., the phosphorus-cycling bacteria Saccharimonadales and Haliangium), respectively. Regardless of ZY01, a stronger selective harboring of tet -host bacteria in PE MP treatments than PBAT MP treatments was observed at the MP dosage of 1 % (w/w), while the opposite trend was true at the MP dosages of 0.5 % and 2 % (w/w). Some specific genera belonging to Actinobacteriota strongly associated with the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), playing a critical role in the horizontal gene transfer of tet in soils especially for the co-existence of MPs and ZY01. This study will be helpful for understanding on how biodegradable and conventional MPs as hotspots affect the environmental behavior of antibiotics and ARGs in soil.

However, the effects of MPs in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems of waste activated sludge (WAS), especially on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), have not been clearly understood. Herein, the variation and interaction of digestion performance, microbial communities and ARGs during AD process of WAS in the presence of polyethylene (PE) MPs with two sizes, PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, were investigated. The results showed that the presence of PE MPs, especially PE MPs-1mm, led to the increased hydrolysis of soluble polysaccharides and proteins and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The methane production decreased by 6.1% and 13.8% in the presence of PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm, respectively. Together with this process, hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens were enriched, and methanogens participating in acetoclastic methanogenesis were reduced. Meanwhile, ARGs were enriched obviously by the presence of PE MPs, the abundances of which in PE MPs-180μm and PE MPs-1mm groups were 1.2–3.0 times and 1.5–4.0 times higher than that in the control by the end of AD. That was associated with different co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial taxa and the enrichment of ARG-hosting bacteria caused by the presence of PE MPs. Together these results suggested the adverse effects of PE MPs on performance and ARGs removal during AD process of WAS through inducing the changes of microbial populations.

The enrichment of ARGs in microplastisphere, the specific niche for diverse microbial communities attached to the surface of microplastic, has attracted worldwide attention. By collecting 477 pairs of ARG abundance data belonging to 26 ARG types, based on the standardized mean difference (SMD) under the random effect model, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the ARG enrichment on microplastics in aquatic environments in order to quantitatively elucidate the enrichment effect, with comparison of non-microplastic materials. It was found that ARGs enriched on the microplastics were more abundant than that on the inorganic substrates (SMD = 0.26) and natural water environments (SMD = 0.10), but lower abundant than that on the natural organic substrates (SMD = −0.52). Furthermore, microplastics in freshwater tended to have a higher degree of ARG enrichment than those in saline water and sewage. The biofilm formation stage, structure, and component of microplastisphere may play a significant role in the enrichment of ARGs. [Display omitted] • Microplastics may enrich ARGs in aquatic environments. • ARG enrichment for microplastics is in-between inorganic and organic substrates. • Microplastics can enrich more ARGs in freshwater than in saline water or sewage. • Biofilm formation process affects the ARG enrichment in the microplastisphere.",20221001,"Yu, Xue ; Zhang, Ying ; Tan, Lu ; Han, Chenglong ; Li, Haixiao ; Zhai, Lifang ; Ma, Weiqi ; Li, Chengtao ; Lu, Xueqiang",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2022,true,Environmental Pollution,Plastic marine debris ; Aquatic biodiversity ; Saline waters ; Microbial communities ; Microplastics ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Random effects model,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,310,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119891,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=2d198f06-2eee-3bb9-b0f5-534252429403

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between environmental degradation and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that the former can potentially fuel the latter with significant public health outcomes. We describe that (i) global warming favors horizontal gene transfer, bacterial infections, the spread of drug-resistant pathogens due to water scarcity, and the release of resistance genes with wastewater; (ii) pesticide and metal pollution act as co-selectors of antibiotic resistance mechanisms; (iii) microplastics create conditions promoting and spreading antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria; (iv) changes in land use, deforestation, and environmental pollution reduce microbial diversity, a natural barrier to antibiotic resistance spread. We argue that management of antibiotic resistance must integrate environmental goals, including mitigation of further increases in the Earth's surface temperature, better qualitative and quantitative protection of water resources, strengthening of sewage infrastructure and improving wastewater treatment, counteracting the microbial diversity loss, reduction of pesticide and metal emissions, and plastic use, and improving waste recycling. These actions should be accompanied by restricting antibiotic use only to clinically justified situations, developing novel treatments, and promoting prophylaxis.

GreenFILE,8gh,181194137,Tire wear particles enhance horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems.,"Microplastics (MPs) have introduced new surfaces for biofilm development and gene exchange among bacteria. We investigated Tire Wear Particles (TWPs) for their involvement in horizontal gene transfer (HGT), particularly in relation to associated metals in the matrices of TWPs. We employed red-fluorescently tagged E. coli strain as a donor with green-fluorescently tagged, broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5, resistant to trimethoprim. As a recipient, we utilized Pseudomonas sp. and a natural lake microbial community. HGT activity on TWPs was determined and compared with that on polystyrene (PS) (with and without metals), and chitosan, which was used as a natural surface. Exposure to TWPs significantly enhanced HGT frequency of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) from donor to recipient compared to PS and chitosan, and metals of TWPs further promoted HGT. HGT frequency on TWPs with Pseudomonas sp. was found to be 10<sup>−3</sup> at 30 °C. in the lake community, it was similarly high already at 25 °C suggesting a higher permissiveness of the natural microbial community towards ARG at lower temperatures. This study sheds light on the potential impact of TWPs in promoting HGT, forming the basis for health risk assessments of TWPs and more generally of MP pollution in various aquatic ecosystems. • Tire wear particles (TWPs) serve as hotspots of horizontal gene exchange (HGT) among bacteria in aquatic ecosystems. • Metals in TWPs play an important role in HGT. • Plasmid exchange primarily happens in microbial biofilms on TWP surfaces. • HGT associated to TWP increases manifold at higher temperatures. • HGT associated to TWP of natural lake bacteria occurs at lower temperatures compared to lab model systems.",20241225,"Jaffer, Yousuf Dar ; Abdolahpur Monikh, Fazel ; Uli, Klümper ; Grossart, Hans-Peter",Article,Academic Journal,Dec2024:Part 3,true,Environmental Research,Biotic communities ; Escherichia coli ; Health risk assessment ; Water pollution ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Biofilms,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,263,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.120187,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ccef787f-f8ff-3ec5-a50c-69a0bb55ceb0

Till-date, there is a scarcity of studies on the interactions of these two factors and their combined influence. The interaction of microplastics has led to the formation of new plastics namely plastiglomerates, pyroplastics. and anthropoquinas. It has long been ignored that the occurrence of microplastics has become a breeding ground for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Evidently microplastics are also associated with the occurrence of other pollutants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. The increased use of antibiotics (after Covid breakout) has further elevated the detrimental effects on human health. Therefore, this study highlights the relation of microplastics with antibiotic resistance generation. The factors such as uncontrolled use of antibiotics and negligent plastic consumption has been evaluated. Furthermore, the future research prospective was provided that can be helpful in correctly identifying the seriousness of the environmental occurrence of these pollutants.

GreenFILE,8gh,173700563,The effect of bulk-biochar and nano-biochar amendment on the removal of antibiotic resistance genes in microplastic contaminated soil.,"Biochar amendment has significant benefits in removing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil. Nevertheless, there is little information on ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. Herein, a 42-day soil microcosm experiment were carried out to study how two coconut shell biochars (bulk- and nano-size) eliminate soil ARGs with/without microplastic presence. The results showed that microplastic increased significantly the numbers and abundances of ARGs in soil at 14d of cultivation. And, two biochars amendment effectively inhibited soil ARGs spread whether or not microplastic was present, especially for nano-biochar which had more effective removal compared to bulk-biochar. However, microplastic weakened soil ARGs removal after applying same biochar. Two biochars removed ARGs through decreasing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, potential host-bacteria abundances, some bacteria crowding the eco-niche of hosts and promoting soil properties. The adverse effect of microplastic on ARGs removal was mainly caused by weakening mobile genetic elements (MGEs) removal, and by changing soil properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that biochar's effect on ARGs profile was changed by its size and microplastic presence through altering MGEs abundances. These results highlight that biochar amendment is still an effective method for ARGs removal in microplastic contaminated soil. [Display omitted] • Biochar effectively removed soil ARGs with or without microplastic presence. • Biochar inhibited the enrichment effect of microplastic on soil ARGs. • Nano-biochar exhibited more effective removal on soil ARGs than bulk-biochar. • ARGs profiles were altered by changing soil properties and bacterial communities.",20240105,"Su, Xiangmiao ; Qian, Fanghan ; Bao, Yanyu",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2024:Part 2,true,Environmental Research,Soil pollution ; Tillage ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Mobile genetic elements ; Horizontal gene transfer,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,240,,10.1016/j.envres.2023.117488,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=014a49c7-e938-37c9-ac1c-5f63d8c0b855
GreenFILE,8gh,163260952,Plastic leachate exposure drives antibiotic resistance and virulence in marine bacterial communities.,"Plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. Plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. However, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. It is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. Here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and AMR within a seawater microcosm community. We show that PVC leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in AMR and virulence genes. In particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches AMR genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. Additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. This study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health.

As an emerging organic pollutant, the presence of microplastics in the soil environment has been widely noticed. Also, due to the overuse of antibiotics, a large amount of antibiotics that cannot be fully absorbed by humans and livestock enter the soil environment in the form of urine or manure, making the soils suffer from serious antibiotic contamination problems. To address the environmental problems of microplastics and antibiotic contamination in soils, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of PE microplastics on antibiotic degradation, microbial community characteristics and ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. The results showed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the degradation of tetracycline, and significantly increased the organic carbon content and decreased the neutral phosphatase activity. The addition of PE microplastics significantly reduced the alpha diversity of soil microbial community. Compared to the single tetracycline contamination. In addition, combined contamination with PE microplastics and tetracycline significantly affected bacterial genera such as Aeromicrobium , Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium and Intrasporangium. Metagenome sequencing studies revealed that the addition of PE microplastics inhibited the dissipation of ARGs in tetracycline-contaminated soils. There were strong positive correlations between Multidrug, Aminoglycoside and Clycopeptide resistance genes and Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria in tetracycline contaminated soils, and there was a strong positive correlation between Aminoglycoside resistance genes and Actinobacteria in combined contamination of PE microplastics and tetracycline.

GreenFILE,8gh,143191619,Downward transport of naturally-aged light microplastics in natural loamy sand and the implication to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.,"Current understanding on the fate and behavior of microplastics (MPs) in complex soil media remains inadequate. We characterized the aging and hetero-aggregation of a MP sampled in farmland soil, and explored its vertical downward transport in natural loamy sand. The MP was identified with FTIR spectrum as polypropylene, a plastic lighter than water. FTIR spectrum combined with SEM imaging confirmed the MP was highly aged, generating colloidal plastic fibers and carbonyl groups. SEM imaging coupled with EDX analysis suggested hetero-aggregation of the MP with soil minerals. Soil leaching tests performed with the clean MP (without soil minerals) (CMP), the raw MP (RMP) (with soil minerals), and the RMP with humic acid (HA) (RMP + HA) demonstrated that the mobility was insignificant for the CMP, moderate for the RMP and highest for the RMP + HA, resulting in a maximal downward traveling distance of 0 cm, 3–4 cm, and 9–10 cm, respectively. Correlation between the maximal traveling distance and zeta potential of the CMP, RMP, and RMP + HA confirmed surface charge as a dominant control on the MP mobility; while the increasing density of the MP, due to hetero-aggregation with soil minerals, was identified as a driving mechanism for its downward transport, despite its intrinsic density lower than water. Occurrence of only the lower-sized rod-shaped plastic fibers at the maximal traveling distance suggested the natural aging, a process leading to plastic vibration and fragmentation, was conducive to plastic translocation. The three explored classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulfonamide) were all detected in the plastic surface, suggesting the MP may function as a potential pathway for the dissemination of ARGs to the deeper soil layer. These findings are important to understand the concentration distribution of both the MPs and ARGs in agriculture impacted soils, a natural reservoir of both emerging contaminants. Image 1 • MPs even with a virgin density lower than water could transport downward in soil. • Both hetero-aggregation and aging promote the downward transport. • Hetero-aggregation with soil mineral and NOM increased MP density and zeta potential. • Aging reduced plastic particle size and produced rod-shaped plastic fibers. • MPs are potential vehicles for downward transport of ARGs in agricultural land.

To investigate the characteristics of MPs geographical distribution and its potential ecological risk in typical urban water, this study was conducted in Zhushan Bay, and we carried out a combination of tests to analyze the distribution of MPs and the migration changes of their surface microbial community composition and ARGs in different media by 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, non-targeted metabolomics and qPCR genomics in the near-shore (I), middle area (Ⅱ) and near-lake (Ⅲ) of Zhushan Bay. The results showed that MPs in fibrous form were dominant in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay; Polyurethane (PU) and Silicone were the main MPs types in Zhushan Bay. The abundance of MPs in the water of Zhushan Bay was winter > summer > autumn > spring; and in the sediment was winter > summer > autumn > spring, respectively. The distribution results of MPs in geographical location are as follows: In the water I > Ⅱ > Ⅲ, sediment exhibited Ⅱ > Ⅲ > I. The results indicate that physicochemical factors will affect the geographical distribution of MPs and their surface microbial community composition in the aquatic environment of Zhushan Bay. More cooperative behaviors and increased metabolically important pathways occurred in the microbial network on water-MPs compared to sediment-MPs. However, the microbial community in the sediment-MPs was more stable and had higher abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). A total of 362 differential metabolites were detected, of which 193 were up-regulated and 19 down-regulated differential metabolites. blaTEM , Sul , and inti1 were prevalent in both the water and sediments of Zhushan Bay.

GreenFILE,8gh,176225775,Can low-temperature thermal hydrolysis mitigate the oxidative stress of polystyrene nanoplastics on anaerobic digestion?,"The presence of micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) in sewage sludge has sparked considerable apprehensions over their potential negative effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) performance. The occurrence of MPs/NPs can trigger oxidative stress on the anaerobic microbiome, leading to potential inhibition of the AD process. While the thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is an extensively utilized sludge pretreatment method for AD, its impact on stress induced by MPs/NPs during AD remains poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the impacts of low-temperature THP (90 °C, 90 min) on AD of sewage sludge in the presence of 150 μg/L of polystyrene nanoplastics (PsNPs) under different solid retention times (SRTs) of 20, 15, and 10 d. The presence of PsNPs resulted in a higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Additionally, their presence caused a significant inhibition of methane production by 28.2%, 29.3%, and 38.8% for SRTs of 20, 15, and 10 d, respectively. Introducing low-temperature THP prior to the AD could partially recover methane production by mitigating ROS-induced stress and curbing the propagation of ARGs during the AD process. These results shed light on the potential benefits of THP and further optimization opportunities in alleviating the adverse effects of MPs/NPs-induced stress during sewage sludge AD. [Display omitted] • PsNPs (150 μg/L) hindered methane production in AD under three different SRTs. • Low-temperature THP as a pre-treatment could partially recover methane production. • PsNPs caused a 41.3% increase in ROS levels under 10 d SRT. • Although PsNPs boosted ARGs propagation, THP showed an opposite pattern. • PsNPs and THP increased the abundance of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium.",20240401,"Azizi, Seyed Mohammad Mirsoleimani ; Dhar, Bipro Ranjan",Article,Academic Journal,Apr2024,true,Chemosphere,Sewage sludge digestion ; Anaerobic digestion ; Sewage sludge ; Polystyrene ; Oxidative stress ; Reactive oxygen species ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,353,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141516,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f0370e58-9100-3607-b5dc-5bcb69f36d04

GreenFILE,8gh,182156524,Dissecting the effects of co-exposure to microplastics and sulfamethoxazole on anaerobic digestion.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotics are frequently and simultaneously detected in sewage and sludge, raising global concerns in recent years. However, their combined effects on anaerobic digestion (AD) remain unclear. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the combinations of different MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate) with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on AD performance and microbial communities. The combined stress slightly decreased the chemical oxygen demand removal rate and total gas/methane production. Furthermore, co-exposure to MPs and SMX visibly changed the anaerobic sludge morphology during AD, reduced the methanogen activity, and increased the residual propionic acid concentration versus a control. The decreased relative abundances of Euryarchaeota ranged from 1.88% to 4.63% in the experimental groups compared with CK, suggesting that the microbial communities were inevitably affected by exposure to SMX alone or combined MPs/SMX. Interestingly, among the top 50 genera, only two were negatively related to a few antibiotic resistance genes, implying that sludge exhibited widespread multiple resistances. The correlation analysis between the MPs and microbial communities suggested that the MP properties, such as the aperture-desorption of MPs, may impact the microbial variations. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of coexisting MPs/SMX on AD. [Display omitted] • Evaluated the combined stress of MPs and SMX on AD performance. • Co-exposure to MPs and SMX changed the anaerobic sludge morphology. • MPs and SMX inevitably affected the microbial communities in AD. • Most genera were positively related to numerous antibiotic resistance genes. • Variations in microbial communities may be due to different MP properties.",20250101,"Kong, Lingjiao ; Shi, Xianyang",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2025,true,Journal of Environmental Management,Chemical oxygen demand ; Anaerobic digestion ; Microbial communities ; Sewage sludge ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0301-4797,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,373,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123562,,EMJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=9f8c8a01-2f54-3400-9fc5-52416c94e468

As the global concern over plastic pollution grows, efforts are underway to find environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics. Bioplastics are being extensively researched and developed as a possible solution. This study compared the impact of two bioplastics, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB), on the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during anaerobic digestion (AD). Both bioplastics (250–500 particles) could be degraded to a certain extent over 79 days, as indicated by higher methane production than the control without bioplastic particles. The PHB 500 reactor showed the highest methane yield along with the highest biodegradation efficiency (91 %) than other reactors amended with PHB and PLA particles. The highest ARG and MGE abundances were also observed in PLA 500, and the lowest ARG abundance was in PLA 250. Conversely, PHB reactors showed a relatively lower ARG abundance than the control. The correlation analysis suggested that most ARGs were positively correlated with PLA and negatively correlated with PHB (except for tet A, tet B, and tet X). Moreover, a correlation between MGEs and ARGs in PLA and PHB reactors was revealed by correlation analysis. These results show that AD responds differently to the different types/levels of bioplastics, which can ultimately influence the behavior of ARG proliferation. Thus, bioplastics may also pose a potential risk for spreading antibiotic resistance. These findings can be used as a basis for setting environmental standards for bioplastics and creating monitoring and control measures to prevent potential negative impacts on public health.",20230501,"Haffiez, Nervana ; Zakaria, Basem S. ; Mohammad Mirsoleimani Azizi, Seyed ; Ranjan Dhar, Bipro",Article,Academic Journal,May2023,true,Environment International,Biodegradable plastics ; Anaerobic digestion ; Environmental standards ; Polylactic acid ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate ; Butyrates ; Mobile genetic elements,JOUR,,,0160-4120,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,175,,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107938,,JQ0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=0980d247-e198-3663-9a43-0a6a4c950d4f
GreenFILE,8gh,161081135,Microplastics existence intensified bloom of antibiotic resistance in livestock feces transformed by black soldier fly.,"Efficient degradation of residual antibiotics in livestock and poultry feces by black soldier flies (BSFs) has been widely reported. Nevertheless, the effects of widely detected microplastics in feces on the dynamic reduction of antibiotics and the transfer of gut bacterial resistome remain unclear. In this study, red fluorescence-labeled microplastics are observed to be abundantly distributed in BSFs gut, which caused epithelial cell damage along with gut peristalsis and friction, thereby releasing reactive oxygen species and activating the antioxidant enzyme system. In addition, they result in not only in inflammatory cytokine release to induce gut inflammation, but fecal hardening because of mucus released from the BSFs, thereby hindering organic mineralization and antibiotic degradation. Besides, the gut pathogenic bacteria easily obtain growth energy and crowded out ecological niches by reducing nitrate produced by inflammatory host cells to nitrite with nitrate reductase. Consequently, linear discriminant analysis effect size and detrended correspondence analysis found that microplastic intake significantly reshape the microbial community structure and cause the significant reduction of several important organic-decomposing bacteria and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomonadales , Coriobacteriales , Lachnospirales , and Ruminococcaceae). In addition, a large number of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcaceae , Hungateiclostridiaceae , and Clostridia) are enriched in feces and BSFs gut. Weighted correlation network analysis and bubble diagram analysis indicate that microplastic intake intensified gut colonization of pathogenic bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes/mobile genetic elements, driving the bloom of antibiotic resistance in transformed fecal piles. Therefore, microplastics in feces should be isolated as much as possible before insect transformation.

GreenFILE,8gh,182343886,Fluvial flooding and plastic pollution – The delivery of potential human pathogenic bacteria into agricultural fields.,"The frequency of plastic debris entering agricultural land is likely going to increase due to increased discharge into surface waters and more frequent flood events. Microbial biofilm on the surfaces of plastic pollution (known as the 'plastisphere') in freshwater environments often includes human pathogenic bacteria capable of causing disease. Pathogens have been detected on the surface of plastics in freshwater environments, but it is yet to be determined whether plastic debris can also transport pathogens into agricultural fields during flooding. Therefore, this study quantified the presence of viable pathogenic bacteria on the surface of plastic pollution at five agricultural fields along two rivers. All visible plastic debris, including sewage-associated plastic waste, were collected along a perpendicular 100 m transect from the riparian zone into each field. All plastic pieces were screened for five target bacteria (Escherichia coli , intestinal enterococci, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp.) using selective media, and positively identified colonies subsequently tested for antimicrobial resistance. In all five fields, there were higher volumes of plastic in the areas closer to the river, with 75% ± 24% of plastic collected within 30 m from the riverbank. Overall, 49% of all plastic collected in agricultural fields was colonised by phenotypically positive colonies for at least one or more target bacteria, with resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics detected among several of these target bacteria. Therefore, the transport of contaminated plastic debris from fluvial floodwater into agricultural fields could pose an as yet unquantified risk of introducing potentially harmful bacteria into agricultural systems and the ultimately into the food chain. [Display omitted] • Plastic debris (including sewage waste) is common in agricultural floodplain fields. • Approximately 75% of plastic in agricultural fields is within 30 m of the river. • Human pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance were common on plastics debris. • Transfer of plastic pollution in floodwater could disseminate human pathogens. • Fluvial flooding introduces plastics and pathogens into agricultural systems.",20250201,"Pow, Chloe J. ; Fellows, Rosie ; White, Hannah L. ; Woodford, Luke ; Quilliam, Richard S.",Article,Academic Journal,Feb2025,true,Environmental Pollution,Agricultural pollution ; Riparian areas ; Water pollution ; Agriculture ; Pathogenic bacteria,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,366,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125518,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f20b8c07-fda4-3f4b-bacc-5878598f2fd7

The results showed that FT significantly increased the total relative abundance of target ARGs in different aggregates due to the increase in intI1 and ARG host bacteria. However, polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) hindered the increase in ARG abundance caused by FT. The host bacteria carrying ARGs and intI1 varied with aggregate size, and the highest number of hosts was observed in micro-aggregates (<0.25 mm). FT and MPs altered host bacteria abundance by affecting aggregate physicochemical properties and bacterial community and enhanced multiple antibiotic resistance via vertical gene transfer. Although the dominant factors affecting ARGs varied with aggregate size, intI1 was a co-dominant factor in various-sized aggregates. Furthermore, other than ARGs, FT, PE-MPs, and their integration promoted the proliferation of human pathogenic bacteria in aggregates. These findings suggested that FT and its integration with MPs significantly affected ARG distribution in soil aggregates. They amplified antibiotic resistance environmental risks, contributing to a profound understanding of soil antibiotic resistance in the boreal region.

Microplastics showed differential capacities for bacteria and ARGs enrichment, differing from those of the culture environment. Furthermore, ARGs in microplastic biofilms were horizontally transferred at frequencies higher than those in water samples in both tanks.

GreenFILE,8gh,162893802,A review on mechanistic understanding of microplastic pollution on the performance of anaerobic digestion.,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) has emerged as a promising technology for diverting the organic waste from the landfills along with the production of clean energy. AD is a microbial-driven biochemical process wherein the plethora of microbial communities participate in converting the putrescible organic matter into biogas. Nevertheless, the AD process is susceptible to the external environmental factors such as presence of physical (microplastics) and chemical (antibiotics, pesticides) pollutants. The microplastics (MPs) pollution has received recent attention due to the increasing plastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. This review was aimed for holistic assessment of impact of MPs pollution on AD process to develop efficient treatment technology. First, the possible pathways of MPs entry into the AD systems were critically evaluated. Further, the recent literature on the experimental studies pertaining to the impact of different types of MPs at different concentrations on the AD process was reviewed. In addition, several mechanisms such as direct exposure of MPs on the microbial cells, indirect impact of MPs through the leaching of toxic chemicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation on AD process were elucidated. Besides, the risk possessed by the increase of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after the AD process due to the MPs stress on microbial communities were discussed.

GreenFILE,8gh,176501155,Biofilm enhances the interactive effects of microplastics and oxytetracycline on zebrafish intestine.,"• Biofilm-microplastics (Biof-MPs) induced greater zebrafish intestinal response. • Biof-MPs changed the biomarker response mode with oxytetracycline co-exposure. • Biofilm significantly enriched pathogens compared with original microplastics. • Biofilm increased antibiotic resistance genes abundance in zebrafish intestine. The enhanced adsorption of pollutants on biofilm-developed microplastics has been proved in many studies, but the ecotoxicological effects of biofilm-developed microplastics on organisms are still unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to original microplastics, biofilm-developed microplastics, original microplastics absorbed with oxytetracycline (OTC), and biofilm-developed microplastics absorbed with OTC for 30 days. The intestinal histological damage, intestinal biomarker response, gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profile of zebrafish were measured to explore the roles of biofilm in the effects of microplastics. The results showed that biofilm-developed microplastics significantly increased the number of goblet cells in intestinal epithelium compared with the control group. The biofilm-developed microplastics also induced the oxidative response in the zebrafish intestines, and biofilm changed the response mode in the combined treatment with OTC. Additionally, the biofilm-developed microplastics caused intestinal microbiome dysbiosis, and induced the abundance of some pathogenic genera increasing by several times compared with the control group and the original microplastics treatments, regardless of OTC adsorption. Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs in biofilm-developed microplastics increased significantly compared with the control and the original microplastic treatments.

GreenFILE,8gh,169815129,Effects of soil solarization combined with manure-amended on soil ARGs and microbial communities during summer fallow.,"Soil solarization (SS) is a technique for managing pathogens and weeds, which involves covering with transparent plastic to increase soil temperature during summer fallow (SF). However, SS also alters the diversity of bacterial communities. Therefore, during SF, various organic modifiers are used in combination with SS to improve its efficacy. Organic amendments may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) soils are vital to ensure food security and ecological balance. However, comprehensive study on the effects of SS combined with different types of manure on ARGs in GVP soils during SF remains unclear. Therefore, this study employed high-throughput qPCR to explore the effects of different organic amendments combined with SS on the abundance changes of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in GVP soils during SF. The abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs in GVP soils with different manure fertilization and SS decreased during SF. Horizontal gene transfer via MGEs (especially integrases 45.80%) induced by changes in environmental factors (NO 3 <sup>−</sup>-N 14.7% and NH 4 <sup>+</sup>-N) was the main factor responsible for the changes in ARGs. Proteobacteria (14.3%) and Firmicutes were the main potential hosts of ARGs. Network analysis suggested that Ornithinimicrobium , Idiomarina and Corynebacterium had positive correlations with aminoglycosides, MLSB, and tetracycline resistance genes. These results provide new insights to understand the fate of ARGs in the GVP soils by manure-amended combined with SS during SF, which may help to reduce the spread of ARGs. [Display omitted] • SS combined with different manures application alleviated the ARGs transmission during SF. • During SF, BM mainly reduced Multidrugs, while CM reduced Beta_ Lactamase (21). • HGT via MGEs contributed more to ARGs abundance than physicochemical properties and microbial. • Potential hosts of ARGs mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.",20230915,"Wang, Xiaojuan ; Zhang, Li ; Gu, Jie ; Feng, Yucheng ; He, Kai ; Jiang, Haihong",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Microbial communities ; Fallowing ; Manures ; Bacterial communities ; Mobile genetic elements ; Horizontal gene transfer,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,333,,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121950,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=62b1e8d6-9544-3d8e-a973-7ce27f02df5c
GreenFILE,8gh,161693843,"Understanding the underestimated: Occurrence, distribution, and interactions of microplastics in the sediment and soil of China, India, and Japan.","Microplastics (MPs) are non-biodegradable substances that can sustain our environment for up to a century. What is more worrying is the incapability of modern technologies to annihilate MPs from om environment. One ramification of MPs is their impact on every kind of life form on this planet, which has been discussed ahead; that is why these substances are surfacing in everyday discussions of scholars and researchers. This paper discusses the overview of the global occurrence, abundance, analysis, and remediation techniques of MPs in the environment. This paper primarily reviews the event and abundance of MPs in coastal sediments and agricultural soil of three major Asian countries, India, China, and Japan. A significant concentration of MPs has been recorded from these countries, which affirms its strong presence and subsequent environmental impacts. Concentrations such as 73,100 MPs/kg in Indian coastal sediments and 42,960 particles/kg in the agricultural soil of China is a solid testimony to prove their massive outbreak in our environment and require urgent attention towards this issue. Conclusions show that human activities, rivers, and plastic mulching on agricultural fields have majorly acted as carriers of MPs towards coastal and terrestrial soil and sediments. Later, based on recorded concentrations and gaps, future research studies are recommended in the concerned domain; a dearth of studies on MPs influencing Indian agricultural soil make a whole sector and its consumer vulnerable to the adverse effects of this emerging contaminant. [Display omitted] • Film & fibre shaped microplastics (MPs) are more abundant in India, China and Japan. • Plastic mulching is the root cause of major MPs pollution in soil and sediment. • Estuarian soil/sediment are more prone to MPs pollution than terrestrial and coastal. • FT-IR is highly used for MPs identification; mass spectrometry & microscopy are least. • MPs work as a vector for metals, PPCPs, surfactants and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).",20230301,"Silori, Rahul ; Shrivastava, Vikalp ; Mazumder, Payal ; Mootapally, Chandrashekar ; Pandey, Ashok ; Kumar, Manish",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Coastal sediments ; Soil pollution ; Soils ; Andosols ; China ; India ; Japan ; Microplastics ; Plastic mulching,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,320,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120978,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a7755d65-e35f-3ae7-af0b-c64fed242f23

Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a new vector for the long-distance transport of pathogens in aquatic ecosystems. However, the composition of viral communities attached on MPs and their environmental risk are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the viral diversity and potential risk in five different MPs collected from the Beilun River based on metagenomic analysis. Nearly 2863 million raw reads were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in the identification of 1719 different species of viruses in MPs. Viruses in polypropylene (PP) displayed the highest diversity, with about 250 specific viruses detected. Source tracking of viruses in MPs by the fast expectation–maximization microbial source tracking method (FEAST) demonstrated that viruses in upstream and downstream MPs are two major sources of viruses in estuary. Furthermore, the MP-type-dependent potential environmental risk of viruses was significant based on both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) detected in viral metagenomes, and PP was confirmed with the highest potential environmental risk. This study reveals the high diversity and potential environmental risk of viruses in different MPs, and provides an important guidance for future environmental monitoring and understanding the potential risks associated with both viral transmission and MPs pollution.",20220301,"Li, Ruilong ; Zhu, Longji ; Cui, Li ; Zhu, Yong-Guan",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2022,true,Environment International,Environmental risk ; Metagenomics ; Watersheds ; Viral transmission ; Drug resistance in bacteria,JOUR,,,0160-4120,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,161,,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107146,,JQ0,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=71e4be56-ec79-3560-8855-fe397266fdcb

GreenFILE,8gh,127815280,Microplastics increase impact of treated wastewater on freshwater microbial community.,"Plastic pollution is a major global concern with several million microplastic particles entering every day freshwater ecosystems via wastewater discharge. Microplastic particles stimulate biofilm formation (plastisphere) throughout the water column and have the potential to affect microbial community structure if they accumulate in pelagic waters, especially enhancing the proliferation of biohazardous bacteria. To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 ( int 1), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of int 1 increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles. Likewise, the microbial community on microplastic was more similar to the original wastewater community with increasing microplastic concentrations. Our results show that microplastic particles indeed promote persistence of typical indicators of microbial anthropogenic pollution in natural waters, and substantiate that their removal from treated wastewater should be prioritised.",20180301,"Eckert, Ester M. ; Di Cesare, Andrea ; Kettner, Marie Therese ; Arias-Andres, Maria ; Fontaneto, Diego ; Grossart, Hans-Peter ; Corno, Gianluca",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2018,true,Environmental Pollution,Plastic marine debris ; Wastewater treatment ; Aquatic microbiology ; Microbial communities ; Freshwater ecology,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,502,495,8,234,,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.070,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=55eb0b2e-5a0c-3af4-8308-909409c044ce
GreenFILE,8gh,160784829,Solid-liquid interface adsorption of antibiotic resistance plasmids induced by nanoplastics aggravates gene pollution in aquatic ecosystems.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have been identified as emerging pollutants in water environment; the interactions between antibiotic resistance plasmids (ARPs) and NPs will influence ARG transport in sediments. Herein, the adsorption experiments of a typical ARP onto polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in river and lake sediments were conducted to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms and the effects of environmental factors. Results indicated that the adsorption amounts of PS-NPs increased with the dosages while decreased with the particle size of sediments. Multi-layer adsorption of PS-NPs was found to exist mainly in sand and silt sediments, whereas the filling adsorption dominated in the clay. Moreover, the adsorbed PS-NPs enhanced the physisorption of ARPs in sediments through stimulating the intraparticle diffusion of ARPs induced by electrostatic force. Besides, the adsorption amounts of ARPs onto the PS-NPs decreased with the increasing pH and dissolve organic matter due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and competitive adsorption. The ion strength played catalytic roles by increasing the electrostatic attraction and adsorption sites of ARPs on PS-NPs. The adsorbed ARPs in sediments were closely related with the ARGs in extra/intracellular DNA of biofilms, influencing the distribution and proliferation of ARGs largely. The findings indicate that ARG-associated pollution might be enhanced by the solid-liquid interface adsorption induced by NPs, which was controlled by pH, ion strength and dissolve organic matter. This study provides supplementary insights into the roles of NPs as carriers of ARP in sediments, and advances our understanding on the risks of NP-ARG co-occurring contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

GreenFILE,8gh,178022727,Accumulation of antibiotics in the environment: Have appropriate measures been taken to protect Canadian human and ecological health?,"In Canada, every day, contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) are discharged from waste treatment facilities into freshwaters. CECs such as pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal care products (PCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and microplastics are legally discharged from sewage treatment plants (STPs), water reclamation plants (WRPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTPs), or other forms of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). In 2006, the Government of Canada established the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) to classify chemicals based on a risk-priority assessment, which ranked many CECs such as PhACs as being of low urgency, therefore permitting these substances to continue being released into the environment at unmonitored rates. The problem with ranking PhACs as a low priority is that CMP's risk management assessment overlooks the long-term environmental and synergistic effects of PhAC accumulation, such as the long-term risk of antibiotic CEC accumulation in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. The goal of this review is to specifically investigate antibiotic CEC accumulation and associated environmental risks to human and environmental health, as well as to determine whether appropriate legislative strategies are in place within Canada's governance framework. In this research, secondary data on antibiotic CEC levels in Canadian and international wastewaters, their potential to promote antibiotic-resistant residues, associated environmental short- and long-term risks, and synergistic effects were all considered. Unlike similar past reviews, this review employed an interdisciplinary approach to propose new strategies from the perspectives of science, engineering, and law. • Antibiotics as contaminants of emerging concern are increasing being released from WWTPs and give rise to ARB and ARG. • The current Canadian Chemical Management Plan (CMP) does not include routine monitoring of antibiotic CECs from wastewater. • Knowledge gaps between scientific data and policy need to be addressed. • A precautionary principle needs to be adopted to prevent antibiotic CECs from becoming long term health risks.",20240715,"Aladekoyi, Oluwatosin ; Siddiqui, Salsabil ; Hania, Patricia ; Hamza, Rania ; Gilbride, Kimberley",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2024,true,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety,Environmental health ; Emerging contaminants ; Sewage disposal plants ; Water reuse ; Canada ; Antibiotic residues ; Fluoroalkyl compounds,JOUR,,,0147-6513,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,280,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116513,,L0E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=814d6544-f127-3809-8e72-54d6fd065916

GreenFILE,8gh,177758463,Stable isotopes and nanoSIMS single-cell imaging reveals soil plastisphere colonizers able to assimilate sulfamethoxazole.,"The presence and accumulation of both, plastics and antibiotics in soils may lead to the colonization, selection, and propagation of soil bacteria with certain metabolic traits, e.g., antibiotic resistance, in the plastisphere. However, the impact of plastic-antibiotic tandem on the soil ecosystem functioning, particularly on microbial function and metabolism remains currently unexplored. Herein, we investigated the competence of soil bacteria to colonize plastics and degrade <sup>13</sup>C-labeled sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Using single-cell imaging, isotope tracers, soil respiration and SMX mineralization bulk measurements we show that microbial colonization of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces takes place within the first 30 days of incubation. Morphologically diverse microorganisms were colonizing both plastic types, with a slight preference for PE substrate. CARD-FISH bacterial cell counts on PE and PS surfaces formed under SMX amendment ranged from 5.36 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 2.06 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and 2.06 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 3.43 × 10<sup>3</sup> hybridized cells mm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively.

GreenFILE,8gh,163946383,Microplastics as vectors of chemical contaminants and biological agents in freshwater ecosystems: Current knowledge status and future perspectives.,"Microplastics (MPs) are becoming ubiquitous, and their environmental fate is becoming an issue of concern. Our review aims to synthesize current knowledge status and provide future perspectives regarding the vector effect of MPs for chemical contaminants and biological agents. The evidence in the literature indicates that MPs are a vector for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and pharmaceuticals. Concentrations of chemical contaminant in orders of six-fold higher on MPs surfaces than in the surrounding environmental waters have been reported. Chemical pollutants such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PAFSs), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), exhibiting polarities in the range of 3.3–9 are the commonest chemicals reported on MP surfaces. Regarding metals on MPs including chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), the presence of C–O and N–H in MPs promote a relatively high adsorption of these metals onto MP surfaces. Regarding pharmaceuticals, not much has been done, but a few studies indicate that commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen have been associated with MPs. There is sufficient evidence supporting the claim that MPs can act as vectors for viruses, bacterial and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, and MPs act to accelerate horizontal and vertical gene transfer. An area that deserves urgent attention is whether MPs can act as vectors for invertebrates and vertebrates, mainly non-native, invasive freshwater species. Despite the ecological significance of invasive biology, little research has been done in this regard.

GreenFILE,8gh,176035821,Can plastic pollution drive the emergence and dissemination of novel zoonotic diseases?,"As the volume of plastic in the environment increases, so too does human interactions with plastic pollution. Similarly, domestic, feral, and wild animals are increasingly interacting with plastic pollution, highlighting the potential for contamination of plastic wastes with animal faeces, urine, saliva, and blood. Substantial evidence indicates that once in the environment, plastics rapidly become colonised by microbial biofilm (the so-called 'plastisphere), which often includes potentially harmful microbial pathogens (including pathogens that are zoonotic in nature). Climate change, increased urbanisation, and the intensification of agriculture, mean that the three-way interactions between humans, animals, and plastic pollution are becoming more frequent, which is significant as almost 60% of emerging human infectious diseases during the last century have been zoonotic. Here, we critically review the potential for contaminated environmental plastics to facilitate the evolution of novel pathogenic strains of microorganisms, and the subsequent role of plastic pollution in the cyclical dissemination of zoonotic pathogens. As the interactions between humans, animals, and plastic pollution continues to grow, and the volume of plastics entering the environment increases, there is clearly an urgent need to better understand the role of plastic waste in facilitating zoonotic pathogen evolution and dissemination, and the effect this can have on environmental and human health.

GreenFILE,8gh,153680578,Enhanced propagation of intracellular and extracellular antibiotic resistance genes in municipal wastewater by microplastics.,"Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging global concern as they are abundant in the environment and can act as vectors of various contaminants. However, whether and how MPs can be vectors of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs), remains far from explicit. This study addresses the adsorption of both intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and eARGs by four types of MPs in municipal wastewater, and then explores the potential horizontal gene transfer of iARGs and eARGs exposed to MPs. Results indicate that though MPs significantly adsorbed both iARGs and eARGs, eARGs were adsorbed with a significantly higher fold enrichment (2.0–5.0 log versus 2.0–3.3 log) and rate (0.0056 min<sup>−1</sup> versus 0.0037 min<sup>−1</sup>) than iARGs. While all four types of MPs adsorbed ARGs, polypropylene MPs showed the highest adsorption capacity for ARGs. Background constituents such as humic acid and antibiotics significantly inhibited adsorption of iARGs, but not eARGs on MPs. The presence of sodium chloride didn't significantly affect adsorption of iARGs or eARGs. The adsorption of ARGs was well explained by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) interaction energy profile. Higher eARG adsorption was attributed to a lower energy barrier between MPs and eARGs than that between MPs and iARGs. Exposure to MPs enhanced horizontal gene transfer of both iARGs and eARGs by 1.5 and 2.0 times, respectively. The improved contact potential between donors and recipients, as well as the increased cell permeability of recipients induced the improved horizontal gene transfer by MPs. This study underscores the need to address ARG propagation through adsorption to MPs. [Display omitted] • Extracellular ARGs are adsorbed at higher fold and rate than intracellular ARGs. • Polypropylene have the highest adsorption capacity of ARGs among all microplastics. • Pollutants alleviate adsorption of intracellular but not extracellular ARGs. • The interaction energy well explains the adsorption of ARGs by microplastics. • Exposure to microplastics enhances horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.",20220101,"Cheng, Yuan ; Lu, Jiarui ; Fu, Shusen ; Wang, Shangjie ; Senehi, Naomi ; Yuan, Qingbin",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2022:Part A,true,Environmental Pollution,Sewage ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Horizontal gene transfer ; Adsorption capacity,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,292,,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118284,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=382b6d3a-4da6-3147-94a7-bcbdf1827b51
GreenFILE,8gh,176010041,Synthetic and natural rubber associated chemicals drive functional and structural changes as well as adaptations to antibiotics in in vitro marine microbiomes.,"The leaching of additives from plastics and elastomers (rubbers) has raised concerns due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemicals extracted from two types of rubber on microbiomes derived from a benthic sea urchin and two pelagic fish species. Additionally, we examined whether bacterial communities preconditioned with rubber-associated chemicals displayed adaptations to antibiotics. At the highest tested concentrations of chemicals, we observed reduced maximum growth rates and yields, prolonged lag phases, and increased alpha diversity. While the effects on alpha and beta diversity were not always conclusive, several bacterial genera were significantly influenced by chemicals from the two rubber sources. Subsequent exposure of sea urchin microbiomes preconditioned with rubber chemicals to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin resulted in decreased maximum growth rates. This indicates a more sensitive microbiome to ciprofloxacin when preconditioned with rubber chemicals. Although no significant interaction effects between rubber chemicals and ciprofloxacin exposure were observed in bacterial alpha and beta diversity, we observed log-fold changes in two bacterial genera in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings highlight the structural and functional alterations in microbiomes originating from various marine species when exposed to rubber-associated chemicals and underscore the potential risks posed to marine life. • Rubber chemicals elicited structural and functional effects on marine microbiomes. • Effects were inconclusive on alpha and beta diversity of the microbiomes. • Specific bacterial genera were affected by the chemicals extracted from rubber. • Preconditioning with rubber chemicals increased the sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. • There are potential risks of rubber-associated chemicals for the microbiome hosts.",20240315,"Carlsen, Eira Catharine Lødrup ; Hjelset, Sverre ; Gomes, Tânia ; Igartua, Amaia ; Sørensen, Lisbet ; Booth, Andy M. ; Hylland, Ketil ; Eiler, Alexander",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety,Toxic substance exposure ; Rubber ; Artificial rubber ; Sea urchins ; Marine biology ; Pelagic fishes ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Physiological adaptation,JOUR,,,0147-6513,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,273,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116134,,L0E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=29f5e842-3399-3b06-8601-44d5307a3604
GreenFILE,8gh,152042762,Distinct profile of bacterial community and antibiotic resistance genes on microplastics in Ganjiang River at the watershed level.,"Microplastics are of great public concern due to their wide distribution and the potential risk to humans and animals. In this study, the microplastic pollution associated with bacterial communities, human pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated compared to water, sediment, and natural wood particles. Microplastics were widely distributed in surface water of the Ganjiang River at a watershed level with an average value of 407 particles m<sup>−3</sup>. The fragment was the main microplastic shape found in the basin. Microplastics had significantly higher observed species and Chao1 index of bacterial communities than those in water, but comparable to wood particles. However, there was no difference in the microplastics pollution and alpha diversity indices of bacterial between different reaches along the Ganjiang River. Flavobacterium , Rhodoferax , Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium on the microplastics were all found to be enriched compared with water and sediment. Principal component analysis of the composition and function profile of bacterial communities showed that microplastics provide a new microbial niche in the Ganjiang River, which was distinct from water, sediment, and natural wood. Pseudomonas genus dominated the composition of human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics, which was significantly different from water and sediment. No difference was observed in the relative abundance of total ARGs among the four media. However, microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs compared with water and sediment. • The distinct composition of bacterial communities on microplastics was found. • Pseudomonas genus dominated the human pathogenic bacteria on the microplastics. • Microplastic and wood particles showed similar composition patterns of ARGs. • No enrichment effect of microplastics on ARGs was observed at the watershed level.",20210901,"Hu, Hua ; Jin, Danfeng ; Yang, Yuyi ; Zhang, Jian ; Ma, Changpo ; Qiu, Zumin",Article,Academic Journal,Sep2021,true,Environmental Research,Microbial communities ; Bacterial communities ; Watersheds ; Drug resistance in bacteria ; Microplastics ; Principal components analysis ; Communities,JOUR,,,0013-9351,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,200,,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111363,,KZQ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=995de4c7-c574-3a7e-aa2c-d9914afe4a38
GreenFILE,8gh,177248201,Effects of combined microplastics and heavy metals pollution on terrestrial plants and rhizosphere environment: A review.,"Microplastics (MPs) can enter the soil environment through industry, agricultural production and daily life sources. Their interaction with heavy metals (HMs) poses a significant threat to a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural ones, thereby affecting crop quality and threatening human health. This review initially addresses the impact of single and combined contamination with MPs and HMs on soil environment, including changes in soil physicochemical properties, microbial community structure and diversity, fertility, enzyme activity and resistance genes, as well as alterations in heavy metal speciation. The article further explores the effects of this pollution on the growth characteristics of terrestrial plants, such as plant biomass, antioxidant systems, metabolites and photosynthesis. In general, the combined contaminants tend to significantly affect soil environment and terrestrial plant growth, i.e., the impact of combined contaminants on plants weight ranged from −87.5% to 4.55%. Similarities and differences in contamination impact levels stem from the variations in contaminant types, sizes and doses of contaminants and the specific plant growth environments. In addition, MPs can not only infiltrate plants directly, but also significantly affect the accumulation of HMs in terrestrial plants. The heavy metals concentration in plants under the treatment of MPs were 70.26%–36.80%. The co-occurrence of these two pollution types can pose a serious threat to crop productivity and safety. Finally, this study proposes suggestions for future research aiming to address current gaps in knowledge, raises awareness about the impact of combined MPs + HMs pollution on plant growth and eco-environmental security. [Display omitted] • The properties of MPs significantly affect their impacts on terrestrial plants. • The combined toxicity of MPs and HMs closely related to their uptake in plants. • Combined toxicity causes oxidative and photosynthesis damage, metabolic disturbance. • Compound pollutants affect soil physicochemical properties, microorganism and enzymes. • Biodegradable-MPs seem to cause greater impacts on soil environment and plant growth.",20240615,"Xu, Lei ; Xie, Wenjun ; Dai, Huiping ; Wei, Shuhe ; Skuza, Lidia ; Li, Jianan ; Shi, Cailing ; Zhang, Lichang",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2024,true,Chemosphere,Heavy metal toxicology ; Plant biomass ; Agriculture ; Soil microbiology ; Microplastics ; Microbial enzymes,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,358,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142107,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=00af14e8-f60c-3fb4-b7d6-0a71df55b4b2
GreenFILE,8gh,155491697,Exposure to microplastics reduces the bioaccumulation of sulfamethoxazole but enhances its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice.,"Microplastics (MPs) have aroused a global health concern and their coexistence with antibiotics is inevitable. However, how MPs would affect the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in humans remains poorly understood. Here a mouse model was used, and through dietary exposure, we observed that while the relative distributions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in tissues were relatively stable, MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues (liver, lung, spleen, heart and kidney). Notably, while SMX and MPs showed a differential effect, MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, with the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes and multidrug genes being significantly increased. We further identified that shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice. Combined, our results demonstrate that MPs reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX, but they enhanced its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice, indicating they might have high risks to humans. [Display omitted] • This is the first report on the effects of MPs on SMX bioaccumulation and their risks in mice. • MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues. • MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and ARG profile. • Combined exposure significantly increased the relative abundances of ARGs. • Shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice.",20220501,"Liu, Jin ; Lv, Min ; Sun, Anqi ; Ding, Jing ; Wang, Yunqing ; Chang, Xianbo ; Chen, Lingxin",Article,Academic Journal,May2022,true,Chemosphere,Bioaccumulation ; Antibiotics ; Gut microbiome ; Microplastics ; Lungs ; Sulfamethoxazole ; Mice,JOUR,,,0045-6535,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,294,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133810,,JQF,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=fa806672-6508-326b-9230-fa56310684c0
GreenFILE,8gh,141640547,Large-scale patterns of soil antibiotic resistome in Chinese croplands.,"Soil is a vital reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but we still know little about their distribution in cropland soils and the main driving forces. Here we performed an investigation for ARGs patterns in 105 cropland soils (planted with maize, peanut or soybean) along a 2, 200 km transect in China using high-throughput quantitative PCR approaches. Totally, 204 ARGs were detected, with a higher diversity found in central China than that in northeast and south China. The most abundant (top 50%) and highly shared (present in >50% samples) ARGs regarded as core resistome were dominated by multidrug resistance genes such as oprJ , acrA-05 and acrA-04. Regressive analyses revealed that the relative abundance of total ARGs and core resistome both had significant relationships with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Anthropogenic factors including the consumption of plastic films and soil properties including heavy metals showed good correlations with the diversity of ARGs. Structural equation modelling analysis further explained that anthropogenic factors were the main forces shaping the ARGs patterns. These findings highlight the importance of human activities in shaping soil antibiotic resistome in the croplands, providing potential management strategies to mitigate the dissemination of ARGs to humans via food chain.

However, rare information on co-occurrence of microplastics and ARGs in coastal recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is available. This study performed field sampling and laboratory analysis to investigate the distribution of microplastics and ARGs in a typical RAS farm. The results showed that microplastics were detected in all water samples with the abundances ranging from 58 to 72 items/m<sup>3</sup>. Absolute abundances of total 10 ARGs in water samples ranged from 3.24 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 7.83 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL while those on microplastic samples were in the range of 1.59 × 10<sup>9</sup>-1.83 × 10<sup>9</sup> copies/g. Microbial communities of microplastics and water showed significant difference at both phylum and genus levels. Microbial community diversity of microplastics was higher than that of water. ARGs including tet G, qnr S, sul 1, sul 2, and erm F possessed relatively more active relationships with bacterial community in water and on microplastics of the RAS farm. The results suggested that microplastics might be an important reservoir of ARGs in RAS farms.

GreenFILE,8gh,164378946,"Microplastics as emergent contaminants in landfill leachate: Source, potential impact and remediation technologies.","A significant amount of plastic waste is generated each year on a global scale, in which the maximum quantity of plastic waste is typically dumped in landfills in various parts of the world. Moreover, dumping plastic waste in landfills cannot address the issue of proper disposal; it simply delays the process. Exploiting waste resources entails environmental hazards because plastic wastes buried in landfills gradually break down into Microplastics (MPs) due to physical, chemical, and biological effects. The possibility of landfill leachate as a source of MPs in the environment has not received much attention. Without systematic treatment, MPs in leachate increase the risk to human health and environmental health since they contain dangerous and toxic pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes transmitted by leachate vectors. Due to their severe environmental risks, MPs are now widely recognized as emerging pollutants. Therefore, the composition of MPs in landfill leachate and the interaction of MPs with other hazardous contaminants are summarised in this review. The available potential mitigation or treatment methods of MPs in landfill leachate as of now, along with the drawbacks and challenges of the present leachate treatment for eliminating MPs, are described in this review. Since it is unclear how MPs will be removed from the current leachate facilities, it is crucial to develop innovative treatment facilities as quickly as possible. Finally, the areas that require more research to provide complete solutions to the persistent problem of plastic debris are discussed. • The environmental impact of microplastic landfills has been overlooked. • The distribution of microplastics in landfills is proposed. • Strategies for efficient treatment of microplastics are enumerated. • Difficulties in implementing these microplastic removal strategies are discussed.",20231001,"V, GodvinSharmila ; Shanmugavel, Surya Prakash ; Tyagi, Vinay Kumar ; Rajesh Banu, J.",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2023,true,Journal of Environmental Management,Plastic marine debris ; Landfill management ; Landfills ; Leachate ; Plastic scrap ; Environmental health ; Microplastics,JOUR,,,0301-4797,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,343,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118240,,EMJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=34418fff-432e-3935-9896-ec0255916b67
GreenFILE,8gh,132782755,Co-selection of multi-antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens in metal and microplastic contaminated environments: An emerging health threat.,"Abstract Misuse/over use of antibiotics increases the threats to human health since this is a main reason behind evolution of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. However, metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, copper and cadmium are accumulating to critical concentration in the environment and triggering co-selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The co-selection of metal driven antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved through co-resistance or cross resistance. Metal driven antibiotic resistant determinants evolved in bacteria and present on same mobile genetic elements are horizontally transferred to distantly related bacterial human pathogens. Additionally, in marine environment persistent pollutants like microplastics is recognized as a vector for the proliferation of metal/antibiotics and human pathogens. Recently published research confirmed that horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distinct microbes present on microplastics is much faster than free living microbes. Therefore, microplastics act as an emerging hotspot for metal driven co-selection of multidrug resistant human pathogens and pose serious threat to humans which do recreational activities in marine environment and ingest marine derived foods. Therefore, marine environment co-polluted with metal, antibiotics, human pathogens and microplastics pose an emerging health threat globally.

Landfill leachate as a potential source of environmental microplastics has not good attention. Microplastics in leachate carry toxic and harmful pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes, and these vectors pose greater risks to human and environmental health without systematic treatment. Recently, the main technologies of landfill leachate treatment process include order batch activated sludge process, membrane biological reaction process, flocculation process, combined filtration process, and constructed wetland process.

GreenFILE,8gh,175873829,Biodegradation of polyethylene and polystyrene by Zophobas atratus larvae from Bangladeshi source and isolation of two plastic-degrading gut bacteria.,"Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern globally, and novel and eco-friendly approaches like bioremediation are essential to mitigate the impact. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and expanded polystyrene (EPS) are three of the most frequently used plastic types. This study examined biodegradation of these using Zophobas atratus larvae , followed by isolation and whole genome sequencing of gut bacteria collected from larvae frass. Over 36 days, 24.04 % LDPE, 20.01 % EPS, and 15.12 % LLDPE were consumed on average by the larvae, with survival rates of 85 %, 90 %, and 87 %, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of fresh plastic types, consumed plastics, and larvae frass showed proof of plastic oxidation in the gut. Frass bacteria were isolated and cultured in minimal salt media supplemented with plastics as the sole carbon source. Two isolates of bacteria were sampled from these cultures, designated PDB-1 and PDB-2. PDB-1 could survive on LDPE and LLDPE as carbon sources, whereas PDB-2 could survive on EPS. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) provided proof of degradation in both cases. Both isolates were identified as strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by sequencing, assembly, and annotation of their genomes. LDPE- and LLDPE-degrading enzymes e.g., P450 monooxygenase, alkane monooxygenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, etc. were identified in PDB-1. Similarly, phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes involved in EPS degradation were identified in PDB-2. Genes of both isolates were compared with genomes of known plastic-degrading P. aeruginosa strains. Virulence factors, antibiotic-resistance genes, and rhamnolipid biosurfactant biosynthesis genes were also identified in both isolates. This study indicated Zophobas atratus larvae as potential LDPE, LLDPE, and EPS biodegradation agent. Additionally, the isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provide a more direct and eco-friendly solution for plastic degradation. Confirmation and modification of the plastic-degrading pathways in the bacteria may create scope for metabolic engineering in the future.

This study provides new insights on microbial diversity and biofilm structure of plastisphere in lake waters. By combining Fourier Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing, we investigated the microbial colonization patterns on floating MPs and, for the first time, the occurrence of eukaryotic core members and their possible relations with biofilm-forming bacterial taxa within the plastisphere of four different lakes. Through PCR-based methods (qPCR, LAMP-PCR), we also evaluated the role of lake plastisphere as long-term dispersal vectors of potentially harmful organisms (including pathogens) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in freshwater ecosystems. Consistent variation patterns of the microbial community composition occurred between water and among the plastisphere samples of the different lakes.

GreenFILE,8gh,122037904,Does antifouling paint select for antibiotic resistance?,"There is concern that heavy metals and biocides contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. Most antifouling paints contain high amounts of such substances, which risks turning painted ship hulls into highly mobile refuges and breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5–4 weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and IS CR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.",20170715,"Flach, Carl-Fredrik ; Pal, Chandan ; Svensson, Carl Johan ; Kristiansson, Erik ; Östman, Marcus ; Bengtsson-Palme, Johan ; Tysklind, Mats ; Larsson, D.G.

However, whether the MPs in aging process affects the fates of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs) in aquatic environments is poorly understood. Herein, the physicochemical property alteration of MPs being aged in landfill leachate, an important reservoir of MPs and ARGs, was investigated, and microbial community evolution and ARGs occurrence of MP surface during the aging process were analyzed. Aging process remarkably altered surface properties, including increasing specific surface areas, causing the formation of oxygen-containing groups, and changing surface morphology, which further increased the probability of microbial colonization. The bacterial assemblage on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential compared to leachate. ARGs quantification results suggested that MPs exhibited selective enrichment for ARGs in a ratio of 5.7–10<sup>3</sup> folds, and the aging process enhanced the enrichment potential. Further co-occurrence networks suggested that the existence of non-random, closer and more stable ARGs-bacterial taxa relations on MP surface affected the ARG transmission. The study of ARG partitioning on MPs indicated that extracellular DNA was a nonnegligible reservoir of ARGs attached on MP surface, and that biofilm bacterial community influenced ARGs partitioning pattern during the aging process. This study confirmed that the aging process could enhance the potential of MPs as vectors for ARGs, which would promote the holistic understanding of MP behavior and risk in natural environments. Image 1 • Natural aging in leachate changed physicochemical properties of MPs. • Aged MPs with altered surface properties induced the attachment of bacteria. • Bacterial communities on MPs showed higher biofilm-forming and pathogenic potential. • Natural aging process enhanced selective enrichment of ARGs on MPs. • Bacterial taxa-ARGs co-occurrence affected the ARG transmission on MPs.

In this study, we determined the permissiveness of aquatic bacteria towards a model antibiotic resistance plasmid, comparing communities that form biofilms on microplastics vs. those that are free-living. We used an exogenous and red-fluorescent E. coli donor strain to introduce the green-fluorescent broad-host-range plasmid pKJK5 which encodes for trimethoprim resistance. We demonstrate an increased frequency of plasmid transfer in bacteria associated with microplastics compared to bacteria that are free-living or in natural aggregates. Moreover, comparison of communities grown on polycarbonate filters showed that increased gene exchange occurs in a broad range of phylogenetically-diverse bacteria.

This study investigated bacterial communities of MP-associated bacteria from different stages of municipal wastewater treatment processes to evaluate the potential negative effect of these biofilms on the environment. The results showed a high diversity of bacteria that were strongly attached to MPs. After all treatment steps, the core bacterial groups remained attached to MPs and escaped from the wastewater treatment plant with effluent water. Several pathogenic bacteria were identified in MP samples from all treatment steps, and most of them were found in effluent water.

GreenFILE,8gh,180822824,Mechanisms of inhibition and recovery under multi-antibiotic stress in anammox: A critical review.,"With the escalating global concern for emerging pollutants, particularly antibiotics, microplastics, and nanomaterials, the potential disruption they pose to critical environmental processes like anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) has become a pressing issue. The anammox process, which plays a crucial role in nitrogen removal from wastewater, is particularly sensitive to external pollutants. This paper endeavors to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the inhibition mechanisms of multi-antibiotic on anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, along with insights into their recovery processes. The paper dives deeply into the various ways antibiotics interact with anammox bacteria, focusing specifically on their interference with the bacteria's extracellular polymers (EPS) - crucial components that maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the cells. Additionally, it explores how anammox bacteria utilize quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms to regulate their community structure and respond to antibiotic stress. Moreover, the paper summarizes effective removal methods for these antibiotics from wastewater systems, which is crucial for mitigating their inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria. Finally, the paper offers valuable insights into how anammox communities can recuperate from multi-antibiotic stress. This includes strategies for reintroducing healthy bacteria, optimizing operational conditions, and using bioaugmentation techniques to enhance the resilience of anammox communities. In summary, this paper not only enriches our understanding of the complex interactions between antibiotics and anammox bacteria but also provides theoretical and practical guidance for the treatment of antibiotic pollution in sewage, ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes.

Biofilms, which are often formed on the surface of plastic waste, may contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs) and their associated microbial communities in biofilms formed on different types of plastic, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples taken from the Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) with visible biofilms were highly abundant, and the average absolute abundance of most tested ARGs in the biofilms was higher than that in the sediment and water, indicating that biofilms on plastics can act as a reservoir for ARGs. Moreover, the biofilms on PE had a higher relative abundance of ARGs, compared to those on other plastics, and Firmicutes on PE may be potential hosts for these ARGs. Furthermore, Bacillus , Mycobacterium and Pseudomonas may be multi-resistance genera on plastics, and tet A and tet W may have more potential hosts on PET and PP. Metals, total phosphorus and salinity may be the major environmental factors regulating ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics. The results provide new insights into evaluating the risks caused by plastic wastes and ARGs in biofilms formed on plastics in estuarine environment.

This study chose tetracycline (TC), ampicillin (AMP) and triclosan (TCS) to investigate the responses of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities on different MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)) biofilms (plastisphere). The adsorption capacity of three pharmaceuticals on PVC and PE decreased in the order of AMP > TC > TCS. PE was more conducive to microbial attachment than PVC. MPs led to the increase of the total copies of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the sewage. Importantly, multidrug ARGs and MGEs were enriched on plastisphere.

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been proposed as important pathways for MPs entry and transport in aquatic environments and are hotspots of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study aimed at characterizing bacterial communities in the early stage of biofilm formation on seven different types of MPs deployed in two different WWTPs effluents as well as measuring the relative abundance of two ARGs (sulI and tetM) on the tested MPs. Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA showed significant higher diversity of bacteria on MPs in comparison with free-living bacteria in the WWTP effluents. β-diversity analysis showed that the in situ environment (sampling site) and hydrophobicity, to a lesser extent, had a role in the early bacterial colonization phase. An early colonization phase MPs-core microbiome could be identified. Furthermore, specific core microbiomes for each type of polymer suggested that each type might select early attachment of bacteria. Although the tested WWTP effluent waters contained antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) harboring the sulI and tetM ARGs, MPs concentrated ARBs harboring the sulI gene but not tetM. These results highlight the relevance of the early attachment phase in the development of bacterial biofilms on different types of MP polymers and the role that different types of polymers might have facilitating the attachment of specific bacteria, some of which might carry ARGs.

GreenFILE,8gh,143658468,Microplastics combined with tetracycline in soils facilitate the formation of antibiotic resistance in the Enchytraeus crypticus microbiome.,"Growing evidence suggests that microplastics can adsorb antibiotics and may consequently exacerbate effects on the health of exposed organisms. Our current understanding of the combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil invertebrates is limited. This study aimed to investigate changes in the microbiome and ARGs in Enchytraeus crypticus following exposure to a soil environment that contained both microplastics and antibiotics. Tetracycline (TC), polyamide (PA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were used to construct microcosms of polluted soil environments (TC, PA, PVC, PA+TC, PVC+TC). The differences in microbiomes and ARGs were determined by bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results show that compared with the Control or microplastics alone treatments, TC was significantly accumulated in E. crypticus when exposed to TC alone or in combination with microplastics (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences about TC accumulation between TC, PA+TC, and PVC+TC treated E. crypticus (P > 0.05). Microplastics and TC significantly disturbed the microbial community, and decreased the microbial alpha diversity of E. crypticus (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between TC, microplastics and their combined exposure treatments, and no toxic synergies on the diversity of E. crypticus microbiome between tetracycline and microplastics in soil environment. All the treatments increased the diversity of ARGs in E. crypticus (39–49 ARGs vs. 25 ARGs of control).

Whether long-term MPs pollution will affect the distribution of HMs and their resistance genes (MRGs) in soil is unknown. Here, metagenomic approach was used to decipher the fate of MRGs in cropland soils with long-term film MPs residues. Similar distribution pattern of MRGs was formed in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. A total of 202 MRG subtypes were detected, with resistance genes for Multimetal, Cu, and As being the most prevalent type of MRGs. MRGs formed a modular distribution of five clusters centered on MRGs including ruvB in long-term film MPs contaminated soil. MRGs also formed tight co-occurrence networks with mobile genetic elements (MGEs: integrons, insertions and plasmids). Redundancy analysis showed that HMs together with microbial communities and MGEs affected the distribution of MRGs in soil. Thirteen genera including Pseudomonas were identified as potential hosts for MRGs and MGEs. The research provides preliminary progress on the synergistic effect of HMs and MPs in affecting soil ecological security. The synergistic effect of MPs and HMs needs to be considered in the remediation of contaminated soils.

Through a literature review, it was examined wastewater sources enriched with carbon and nutrients, including municipal wastewater and associated sludge, vinasse, swine wastewater, as well as wastewater from the food industry and paper and pulp production. The review also explores the dynamics of organic matter within the soil, discussing the aspects related to its potential conversion to CO 2 or long-term storage. It was found that industrial wastewaters, owing to their higher organic matter and recalcitrance, exhibit greater potential for carbon storage. However, the presence of pollutants in wastewater necessitates careful consideration, particularly concerning their impact on soil quality. Toxic metals, microplastics, and organic compounds emerged as significant contaminants that could accumulate in the soil, posing risks to ecosystem health. To mitigate the environmental impacts, it was evaluated various wastewater treatment technologies and their associated carbon emissions. While advanced treatments may effectively reduce the contaminant load and mitigate soil impacts, their adoption is often associated with an increase in CO 2 emissions. Membrane bioreactors, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors were identified as promising technologies with lower carbon footprints. Looking ahead, future research should aim to enhance the understanding of carbon dynamics in soil and validate the environmental impacts of treated wastewater disposal. Despite remaining uncertainties, the literature indicates a positive outlook for wastewater recycling in soil, offering a viable strategy for carbon storage and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

GreenFILE,8gh,162009923,Photoaging processes of polyvinyl chloride microplastics enhance the adsorption of tetracycline and facilitate the formation of antibiotic resistance.,"Microplastics (MPs), antibiotics and microorganism ubiquitously coexist in aquatic environments. MPs inevitably undergo photoaging processes in aquatic environments, affecting the interactions between MPs and antibiotics and the antibiotic resistance of microorganism. In this study, the impact of photoaging processes of MPs on their adsorption behavior of tetracycline (TC) and related formation of antibiotic resistance were investigated. It was found that the photoaging processes significantly increased the adsorption capacity of TC onto MPs, with the Q e increasing from 0.387 to 0.507 mg/g at 288 K and from 0.507 to 0.688 mg/g at 308 K. The site energy distribution (SED) analysis further confirmed that the enhanced adsorption capacity was attributed to more high-energy adsorption sites acquired from MPs photoaging processes. Moreover, the enhanced adsorption of TC further facilitated the formation of seven antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., tetA , tetB , tetC , tetD , tetE , tetG , tetK) when MPs adsorbed with TC was covered by biofilm. This study helps comprehensively understand the environmental behaviors of co-existing MPs, antibiotics and microorganisms, providing a theoretical basis for evaluating and mitigating their coexistence risks.

Microplastics (MPs) are a class of contaminants of emerging concern that can exert both direct and indirect ecotoxicological effects. A growing number of studies have investigated MPs-attached microbial communities, but the interaction between MPs and substrate-associated biofilm (i.e., on natural river substrates, such as stones and sediments) remains poorly studied. In this work, the combined effects of polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) with a particle size of 10–45 μm (2 mg/L) and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) (20 μg/L) were investigated on river biofilms through a short-term exposure experiment (72 h). To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of MPs and chemical contaminants in substrate-associated river biofilms were assessed. Different response parameters were evaluated, including (i) exposure assessment and ii) contaminants effects at different levels: bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), photosynthetic efficiency (Y eff), and leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAPA). Triclosan was accumulated in river biofilms (1189–1513 ng/g dw) alongside its biotransformation product methyl-triclosan (20−29 ng/g dw). Also, PE-MPs were detected on biofilms (168−292 MP/cm<sup>2</sup>), but they had no significant influence on the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of TCS. A moderate shift in bacterial community composition was driven by TCS, regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure (e.g., increased relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae family). Additionally, Y eff and EPS content were significantly disrupted in TCS-exposed biofilms. Therefore, the most remarkable effects on river biofilms were related to the antimicrobial TCS, whereas single PE-MPs exposure did not alter any of the evaluated parameters. These results demonstrate that biofilms might act as environmental sink of MPs. Although no interaction between PE-MPs and TCS was observed, the possible indirect impact of other MPs-adsorbed contaminants on biofilms should be further assessed. [Display omitted] • Between 10 and 17% of the suspended polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) were accumulated in biofilms. • Exposure to PE-MPs did not affect structural and functional parameters of biofilms. • The antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) was accumulated and transformed by biofilms regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure. • Bacterial community structure and function of biofilms was affected by TCS. • Co-exposure to PE-MPs did not influence the toxicity of TCS.",20240301,"Castaño-Ortiz, J.M. ; Romero, F. ; Cojoc, L. ; Barceló, D. ; Balcázar, J.L. ; Rodríguez-Mozaz, S. ; Santos, L.H.M.L.M.",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2024,true,Environmental Pollution,Emerging contaminants ; Bioconversion ; Biotic communities ; Polyethylene ; Biofilms ; Triclosan ; Microplastics,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,344,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123369,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=39797791-d858-33e8-8ed5-96e6069894b3
GreenFILE,8gh,180630964,Size-dependent toxic interaction between polystyrene beads and mercury on the mercury accumulation and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) of brackish water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis.,"Due to their worldwide distribution and persistence, mercury (Hg), and nano- and microplastics (NMPs) pose major threats to global ocean ecosystems. Hg and NMPs co-exist in the ocean and can interact with each other. However, information on the toxicity of this interaction to marine biota remains limited. Thus, we investigated the toxicological interaction between HgCl 2 (Hg) and NMPs by studying the influence of different sizes of polystyrene beads (0.05-, 0.5-, and 6-μm) on Hg accumulation in the brackish water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis. The Hg adsorption capacity of NPs (0.05-μm) was higher than that of MPs (0.5- and 6-μm). Only the group co-exposed to both Hg and NPs showed increased Hg content in D. celebensis. Multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity and transcriptional modulation of transporter genes (ABCBs and ABCCs) were decreased by NMP exposure, particularly by NPs, suggesting MXR disruption by NPs. However, only the activity of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs; ABCCs) increased with Hg exposure and decreased upon NP+Hg co-exposure, indicating an important role of ABCC in Hg efflux. Furthermore, in vivo toxicity tests showed a synergistic toxic interaction between Hg and NPs on the reproduction of D. celebensis. Our findings suggest that NPs have the potential to enhance the toxicity of Hg, increasing Hg accumulation not only by serving Hg as a carrier but also by disrupting MXR.

Recovered plastic waste is a complex and heterogeneous material, and the impurities and/or untargeted polymers associated to plastic waste may affect the recycling process and potentially decrease the intended benefits. An environmental and financial assessment was conducted on one tonne of hard plastic waste collected at Danish recycling centres. Three management scenarios were considered: two mechanical recycling (a simpler and a more advanced configuration, namely sMR and aMR) and a feedstock recycling (FR) scenario based on conversion through pyrolysis. Scenario aMR provided the largest savings in the highest number of impact categories (including global warming potential) and total costs; scenarios sMR and FR provided smaller savings (or even burdens), depending on the environmental impact category considered. A scenario analysis evaluating the type of energy provision, location of recycling facilities and the application of the recycled material confirmed the ranking of results with respect to global warming potential and total costs. A global sensitivity assessment of model data inputs demonstrated that three to nine parameters were typically sufficient to achieve more than 90% of total variance of the results; critical parameters were mainly related to sorting efficiencies, technical yields and market substitution factors.

MPs and NPs have also been implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MPs and NPs can access organisms via dietary and respiratory pathways and through the epidermis. Their reported effects include: changes in microbiota and digestive enzyme production; inflammatory processes at respiratory level; circulatory and reproductive system disorders; and neurotoxicity, inducing behavioral changes.

However, the enrichment characteristics of ARGs on MPs and the effect of MPs' presence on ARGs in surrounding leachates are little studied. Therefore, we investigated the differences of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), bacterial communities and pathogens on polystyrene MPs, in MPs-surrounding leachate and in control (leachate with the absence of MPs). The results revealed that ARGs were selectively enriched on MPs, which was similar in three types of leachate environments. The genes strB and bla TEM were maximally enriched and mefA , ermB , tetM and tetQ were slightly enriched on MPs, and the degree of ARGs enrichment increased with time during the 60 days of the experiment. Furthermore, compared to the leachate, MPs were observed to have the higher abundances of MGEs and distinct bacterial communities, both of which were closely associated with ARGs on MPs. Pathogens were distinct and more abundant on MPs compared to that in leachate, and 11 pathogens were identified as potential hosts for ARGs on MPs. Additionally, the presence of MPs (500 mg/L) induced few changes in ARGs' abundances, MGEs' abundances and bacterial communities in MP-surrounding leachate within 60 days.

GreenFILE,8gh,141637168,Fate and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes on microplastics in facility vegetable soil.,"Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) coexist widely in farmland soils, but the fate and abundance of ARGs on MPs is rarely explored. In this study, high-throughput fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine ARGs on MPs in facility vegetable soil. The results indicated that when the particle size of the MPs was larger, the weathering was more serious, or the MPs came from soils with a long vegetable cultivation period, the levels of antibiotics and heavy metals on the MPs were higher. The distribution of the detected ARGs types on distinct MPs showed changes. Compared with weakly weathered MPs, the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes on strongly weathered MPs were decreased by 2.6% and 1.7%, while the detected sul -ARGs and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes were increased by 1.5% and 2.8%. Compared with smaller MPs, the detected MLSB and vancomycin resistance genes on larger MPs were decreased by 2.0% and 1.4%, while the detected fluoroquinolone, quinolone, florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amphenicol (FCA) resistance genes and sul -ARGs were increased by 1.2% and 1.0%. Compared with MPs in soil after three years of vegetable cultivation, the detected FCA resistance genes and sul -ARGs on MPs in soil after ten years of vegetable cultivation were decreased by 1.3% and 1.6%, while the detected beta lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes were increased by 1.0% and 1.7%. This study suggests that MPs with larger size, stronger weathering or from soil after long-term vegetable cultivation adsorb more antibiotics and heavy metals and cause more mobile genetic elements, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance on the MPs. Unlabelled Image • ARG abundance on larger MPs was higher than on smaller MPs by increasing 98.8%–154.4% • ARG abundance on strongly weathered MPs exceeded weakly weathered MPs by 0–45.7% • ARG abundance on MPs after 10 planting years exceeded 3 planting years by 25%–148%",20200320,"Lu, Xiao-Ming ; Lu, Peng-Zhen ; Liu, Xue-Ping",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2020,true,Science of the Total Environment,,JOUR,,,0048-9697,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,709,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136276,,3QW,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4b13b5aa-353e-3945-8736-25ae8de2b4b1

This is especially true in the Mediterranean region, where wetlands support endemic and threatened species and remain integral to human societies, but have been severely degraded in recent decades. Here, in order to raise awareness of future challenges and opportunities for Mediterranean wetlands, and to inform proactive research and management, we identified (a) 50 key issues that might affect Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050, and (b) 50 important research questions that, if answered, would have the greatest impact on the conservation of Mediterranean wetlands between 2020 and 2050. We gathered ideas through an online survey and review of recent literature. A diverse assessment panel prioritised ideas through an iterative, anonymised, Delphi-like process of scoring, voting and discussion. The prioritised issues included some that are already well known but likely to have a large impact on Mediterranean wetlands in the next 30 years (e.g. the accumulation of dams and reservoirs, plastic pollution and weak governance), and some that are currently overlooked in the context of Mediterranean wetlands (e.g. increasing desalination capacity and development of antimicrobial resistance). Questions largely focused on how best to carry out conservation interventions, or understanding the impacts of threats to inform conservation decision-making.

GreenFILE,8gh,151383813,How anammox responds to the emerging contaminants: Status and mechanisms.,"Numerous researches have been carried out to study the effects of emerging contaminants in wastewater, such as antibiotics, nanomaterials, heavy metals, and microplastics, on the anammox process. However, they are fragmented and difficult to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effects on reactor performance and the metabolic mechanisms in anammox bacteria. Therefore, this paper overviews the effects on anammox processes by the introduced emerging contaminants in the past years to fulfill such knowledge gaps that affect our perception of the inhibitory mechanisms and limit the optimization of the anammox process. In detail, their effects on anammox processes from the aspects of reactor performance, microbial community, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and functional genes related to anammox and nitrogen transformation in anammox consortia are summarized. Furthermore, the metabolic mechanisms causing the cell death of anammox bacteria, such as induction of reactive oxygen species, limitation of substrates diffusion, and membrane binding are proposed. By offering this review, the remaining research gaps are identified, and the potential metabolic mechanisms in anammox consortia are highlighted.

The partition of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between the microplastics (MPs) and the surrounding water with various salinity are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that adsorption of antibiotics on MPs might cause a significant change of the structure of microbial communities, diversity and abundance of ARGs on MPs and this might be further affected by change of salinity. In this study, we investigated adsorption of four common antibiotics (sulfamerazine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and tylosin) to polyethylene (PE) MPs in river, estuary and marine waters, and the differences of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities on MPs and in the three waters. The results showed that MPs can enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbes from the surrounding water. Elevated salinity could reduce adsorption of antibiotics to MPs and the abundance of ARGs. For example, MPs can concentrate more antibiotics and ARGs in the fresh river water than in the estuary and the marine waters. In addition, ARGs and bacterial communities on MPs at various salinity were significantly different under the pressure of four antibiotics. On MPs, sul1, sulA/folP-01, tetA, tetC, tetX and ermE increased significantly but a few new ARGs such as sulA/folP-01 and tetA appeared. The structure of the bacterial communities on MPs was different from the surrounding water since some bacteria species found on MPs were barely detected in the surrounding water while some genera on MPs vanished after exposure to antibiotics. As the antibiotics adsorbed and the ARGs on MPs decreased with the water salinity, the structure of the communities on MPs thus varied with salinity change. These findings are important to understand the effects of MPs on the transport, fate and ecological risk of antibiotics and ARGs in different aquatic environments.",20200315,"Wang, Shanshan ; Xue, Nana ; Li, Wenfeng ; Zhang, Daoyong ; Pan, Xiangliang ; Luo, Yongming",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2020,true,Science of the Total Environment,,JOUR,,,0048-9697,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,708,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134594,,3QW,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=44ecad25-a466-3ea3-9eee-198c4c3f15d4

For the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are proposed as safer alternatives. They have already been released into the aquatic environment without previously available information about their potential adverse effects. In this study, we compared the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF exposure to the expression profile of genes involved in the endocrine pathway (EcR and E74), ecdysone metabolism (Cyp18a1 and Shadow), apoptosis (DRONC) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 gene (MRP1) in the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera). The three toxicants increased Shadow expression, which is involved in ecdysone synthesis, but only BPF significantly altered Cyp18a1 , which is implicated in ecdysone degradation. BPS and BPF modified EcR and E74 expression; BPF upregulated the effector caspase DRONC. Furthermore, BPA significantly increased MRP1 expression. This study provides insights into the action of bisphenols at the molecular level and highlights the potential risks of BPS and BPF as BPA alternatives.

GreenFILE,8gh,153093135,"Additive genetic variance for traits least related to fitness increases with environmental stress in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria.","Under environmental stress, previously hidden additive genetic variation can be unmasked and exposed to selection. The amount of hidden variation is expected to be higher for life history traits, which strongly correlate to individual fitness, than for morphological traits, in which fitness effects are more ambiguous. However, no consensual pattern has been recovered yet, and this idea is still debated in the literature. Here, we hypothesize that the classical categorization of traits (i.e., life history and morphology) may fail to capture their proximity to fitness. In the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, a model organism for the study of insect polyphenism, we quantified changes in additive genetic variation elicited by lifetime thermal stress for ten traits, in which evolutionary significance is known. Irrespective of their category, traits under strong stabilizing selection showed genetic invariance with environmental stress, while traits more loosely associated with fitness showed a marked increase in additive genetic variation in the stressful environment. Furthermore, traits involved in adaptive phenotypic plasticity (growth compensation) showed either no change in additive genetic variance or a change of moderate magnitude across thermal environments. We interpret this mitigated response of plastic traits in the context of integrated evolution to adjust the entire phenotype in heterogeneous environments (i.e., adaptiveness of initial plasticity, compromise of phenotypic compensation with stress, and shared developmental pathway). Altogether, our results indicate, in agreement with theoretical expectations, that environmental stress can increase available additive genetic variance in some desert locust traits, but those closely linked to fitness are largely unaffected. Our study also highlights the importance of assessing the proximity to fitness of a trait on a case‐by‐case basis and in an ecologically relevant context, as well as considering the processes of canalization and plasticity, involved in the control of phenotypic variation.",20211015,"Chapuis, Marie‐Pierre ; Pélissié, Benjamin ; Piou, Cyril ; Chardonnet, Floriane ; Pagès, Christine ; Foucart, Antoine ; Chapuis, Elodie ; Jourdan‐Pineau, Hélène",Article,Academic Journal,Oct2021,true,Ecology & Evolution (20457758),Biological fitness ; Desert locust ; Genetic variation ; Phenotypic plasticity ; Thermal stresses,JOUR,,,2045-7758,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,13947,13930,18,11,20,10.1002/ece3.8099,,FT2S,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=d75c8d48-3088-398c-a94a-9873ef893b90

The shipping containers that are used to transport and store fresh produce may play a role in cross contamination and subsequent illnesses. However, methods for quantitatively attached cells are somewhat variable. The overall goal of this study was to compare conventional plating with molecular methods for quantitating attached representative strains forSalmonellaTyphimurium and Heidelberg on reusable plastic containers (RPC) coupons, respectively. We attachedSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and serovar Heidelberg SL486 (parent and an antibiotic resistant marker strain) to plastic coupons (2.54 cm2) derived from previously used shipping containers by growing for 72 h in tryptic soy broth. The impact of the concentration of sanitizer on log reductions between unsanitized and sanitized coupons was evaluated by exposing attachedS. Typhimurium cells to 200 ppm and 200,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Differences in sanitizer effectiveness between serovars were also evaluated with attachedS. Typhimurium compared to attachedS. Heidelberg populations after being exposed to 200 ppm peracetic acid (PAA). Treatment with NaClO caused an average of 2.73 ± 0.23 log CFU ofS. Typhimurium per coupon removed with treatment at 200 ppm while 3.36 ± 0.54 log CFU were removed at 200,000 ppm. Treatment with PAA caused an average of 2.62 ± 0.15 log CFU removed forS. Typhimurium and 1.41 ± 0.17 log CFU forS. Heidelberg (parent) and 1.61 ± 0.08 log CFU (marker). Lastly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize cell attachment and coupon surface topography. SEM images showed that remaining attached cell populations were visible even after sanitizer application.

GreenFILE,8gh,127032456,Transcriptional activity of detoxification genes is altered by ultraviolet filters in Chironomus riparius.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters are compounds used to prevent the damage produced by UV radiation in personal care products, plastics, etc. They have been associated with endocrine disruption, showing anti-estrogen activity in vertebrates and altering the ecdysone pathway in invertebrates. Although they have attracted the attention of multiple research teams there is a lack of data about how animals activate detoxification systems, especially in invertebrates. Here, analysis of the effects of two UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), on the transcriptional activity of nine genes covering the three steps of the detoxification process has been performed. Four cytochrome P450 genes belonging to different members of this family, five GST genes, and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) gene were studied by RT-PCR to analyze their transcriptional activity in fourth instar larvae exposed to the UV filters for 8 and 24 h. The obtained results show a differential response with downregulation of the different Cyp450s tested by 4MBC while BP3 seems not to modify their expression. On the other hand, some of the GST genes were affected by one or other of the filters, showing a less homogenous response. Finally, MRP1 was activated by both filters but at different times.

Microbial-based bioremediation is gaining increasing interest as an effective, economically and environmentally sustainable strategy. Here, we hypothesized that the heavily polluted coastal area facing the Sarno River mouth, which discharges >3 tons of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ∼15 tons of heavy metals (HMs) into the sea annually, hosts unique microbiomes including marine bacteria useful for PAHs and HMs bioremediation. We thus enriched the microbiome of marine sediments, contextually selecting for HM-resistant bacteria. The enriched mixed bacterial culture was subjected to whole-DNA sequencing, metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) annotation, and further sub-culturing to obtain the major bacterial species as pure strains. We obtained two novel isolates corresponding to the two most abundant MAGs (Alcanivorax xenomutans strain-SRM1 and Halomonas alkaliantarctica strain-SRM2), and tested their ability to degrade PAHs and remove HMs. Both strains exhibited high PAHs degradation (60–100%) and HMs removal (21–100%) yield, and we described in detail >60 genes in their MAGs to unveil the possible genetic basis for such abilities. Most promising yields (∼100%) were obtained towards naphthalene, pyrene and lead. We propose these novel bacterial strains and related genetic repertoire to be further exploited for effective bioremediation of marine environments contaminated with both PAHs and HMs. [Display omitted] • Highly polluted sediments' microbiome enriched for PAH- and HM-remediating bacteria. • Two new Alcanivorax and Halomonas strains isolated show high bioremediation yields. • Metagenome assembly unveiled their novel genomic assets for PAH and HM remediation. • Possible use for efficient bioremediation of sites mixedly polluted by PAHs and HMs.",20230115,"Dell'Anno, Filippo ; Joaquim van Zyl, Leonardo ; Trindade, Marla ; Buschi, Emanuela ; Cannavacciuolo, Antonio ; Pepi, Milva ; Sansone, Clementina ; Brunet, Christophe ; Ianora, Adrianna ; de Pascale, Donatella ; Golyshin, Peter N. ; Dell'Anno, Antonio ; Rastelli, Eugenio",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2023,true,Environmental Pollution,Marine sediments ; Contaminated sediments ; Heavy metals ; Bioremediation ; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ; Plastic marine debris,JOUR,,,0269-7491,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,317,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120772,,JE4,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4e99f826-0340-396b-97ac-9132d72aa690

MPs research is mainly concentrated on water, with limited research on MPs in sewage sludge. MPs from various sources are collected into sewage and most of the MPs are trapped in the sludge during the sewage treatment process. Sludge is not only a sink of MPs, but also a source. Soil amendment with sludge provides nutrients into the soil, but it can also import substantial MPs into the soil, which has certain environmental risks. Therefore, we focused on the MPs in sludge and sludge-amended soil and conducted a literature review to summarize the sources, physical properties and fate of the MPs in sludge, as well as their separation, identification and statistical methods. MPs can accumulate in the soil, influence the properties of the soil, and also migrate, which might result in the pollution of deep soils and groundwater. In addition, the adsorption by MPs of heavy metals, organic pollutants, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes cannot be ignored as sewage sludge generally contains substantial concentrations of these pollutants. They can be adsorbed by the MPs and transferred into the soil with sludge amendment of soil. The combination and interaction of MPs with its adsorbed pollutants might increase environmental risk, further leading to possibility of them being uptaken by plants.

Health care is responsible for a range of negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, plastics waste, and pharmaceutical pollution of ecosystems through excretion and inappropriate disposal. Evidence on the scale of these impacts has been growing in high-income countries. To date, there has been only limited discussion of how environmental impacts might be incorporated into economic evaluations of health care programs, including health technology assessment. This paper considers why and how this aim might be achieved, using perspectives from both mainstream and ecological economics. There are strong arguments for using economic evaluation to internalise the negative environmental externalities currently being generated by health care, as well as precautionary arguments for health systems to better understand their exposure to their environmental impacts. The paper tests the feasibility of incorporating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions within costing for economic evaluation, and concludes that the use of shadow prices to achieve this aim is feasible. It suggests that this cost-based approach is preferable to more convoluted attempts to incorporate environmental impacts in the outcome component of health economic evaluations.

In this study, we investigated the individual and combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and chromium (Cr) on the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna by measuring mortality, bioaccumulation, antioxidative response, multixenobiotic resistance activity, and sestrin-related mitochondrial biogenesis in short-term assays and in vivo endpoints including reproduction and adult survival rate in long-term assays. Exposure to MPs, Cr, and their combination caused significant deleterious effects and acute toxicity in D. magna. Alterations in oxidative stress occurred in the groups treated with MPs and Cr alone and together. However, upon co-exposure to MPs, the Cr concentration, measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, decreased, suggesting that MPs and Cr interact with each other.

The ever-growing production of non-recyclable plastic products causes plastic pollution to be the one of most pressing environmental issues. The transition of petrochemical-based plastic with eco-friendly biodegradable plastic has become the promising solution to overcome the plastic pollution crisis. Recent research addressed the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which is a class of bioplastic through the valorisation of wastewater sludge. However, the high production cost and limited process feasibility studies hinder the commercialisation of the waste-derived PHA synthesis process. Since there is a lack of exploration on material integration by implementing an industrial symbiosis network that could potentially enhance the sustainability of waste-derived PHA production, this paper proposes the optimisation of bioplastic production by creating a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen industrial symbiosis network (CHOSYN) to solve sludge management and resources consumption problem concurrently. The atomic targeting approach is used to benchmark the resources and waste discharge from the model. The findings indicate that the proposed process framework attains sustainability improvement in economic and environmental aspects as compared to the conventional PHA synthesis process.

How the interaction between PS and increasing CO 2 concentration affects the plant-soil system is rarely investigated. Here, a free-air CO 2 enrichment system in farm fields was used to study the impacts of PS added to soil at 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> on rice and soil bacterial communities at different CO 2 levels (ambient∼390 ppm and elevated∼590 ppm). Results showed that single PS interfered with Fe, Mn and Zn uptake of rice, and it increased the abundances of bacteria taxa assigned to N turnover and urease activities, leading to altered soil N transformation and availability. Elevated CO 2 alone enhanced rice photosynthesis, decreased the abundances of nitrogen-fixation bacteria, and induced co-occurrence patterns between bacteria simpliﬁed and decentralized. Combined PS and elevated CO 2 significantly decreased rice stomatal conductance and transpiration rate by 56.70% and 29.46%, respectively, and further inhibited elements uptake. Besides, combined exposure significantly disturbed bacterial amino acid metabolism, and stimulated the adaptative responses of resistant bacteria.

However, a comprehensive review on the characteristics and factors that influence MPs distribution in soils, the sorption characteristics and mechanisms of soil contaminants by MPs, especially the interactions of MPs and their complexes with pollutants in the soil-plant systems remains rarely available at present. This review focuses on the sorption features and mechanisms of pollutants by MPs in soil and discussed the effects of MPs and their complexing with pollutants on soil properties, microbe and plants. The polarity of MPs significantly influenced the sorption of OPs, and different sorption mechanisms are involved for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic OPs. The sorption of OPs on MPs in soils is different from that in water. Aging of MPs can promote the sorption and migration of contaminants. The enhanced effects of biofilm in microplastisphere on the sorption of pollutants by MPs are critical, and interactions of soil environment-MPs-microbe-HMs-antibiotics increase the potential pathogens and larger release of resistance genes. The coexistence of HMs and MPs affected the growth of plants and the uptake of HMs and MPs by the plants. Moreover, the type, dose, shape and particle size of MPs have important influences on their interactions with pollutants and subsequent effects on soil properties, microbial activities and plant growth.

WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 μm, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers. • Despite high capture efficiency, treated wastewater is a source of microplastics. • Residual MP removal from treated wastewater is still at the experimental stage. • Innovation to enhance MP removal needs policy and regulation incentives. • Global governance frameworks for MP pollution are fragmented and uncoordinated.",20200715,"Freeman, Shirra ; Booth, Andy M. ; Sabbah, Isam ; Tiller, Rachel ; Dierking, Jan ; Klun, Katja ; Rotter, Ana ; Ben-David, Eric ; Javidpour, Jamileh ; Angel, Dror L.",Article,Academic Journal,Jul2020,true,Journal of Environmental Management,Plastic marine debris ; Wastewater treatment ; Sewage disposal plants ; International cooperation,JOUR,,,0301-4797,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,266,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110642,,EMJ,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e4fbe000-1084-32be-9bd9-f06e0861f9f9

However, the effects and mechanisms of MPs and TBT exposure (especially the co-exposure of both pollutants) on mammals remain unclear. In this study, Ф5 μm MPs (5MP) was administered alone or in combination with TBT to investigate the health risk of oral exposure in mice. All three treatments induced inflammation in the liver, altered gut microbiota composition and disturbed fecal bile acids profiles. In addition to decreasing triglyceride (TG) and increasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and macrophage-expressed gene 1 (Mpeg1), 5MP induced hepatic cholestasis by stimulating the expression of the cholesterol hydroxylase enzymes CYP8B1 and CYP27A1, and inhibiting multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 3 (MRP2, MRP3), and bile-salt export pump (BSEP) to prevent bile acids for entering the blood and bile. Correspondingly, 5MP treatment decreased 7-ketolithocholic acid (7-ketoLCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA), which were positively correlated with decreased Bacteroides and Marvinbryantia and negatively correlated with increased Bifidobacterium. In addition, TBT increased interferon γ (IFNγ) and Mpeg1 levels to induce inflammation, accompanied by decreased 7-ketoLCA, tauro-alpha-muricholic acid (T-alpha-MCA) and alpha-muricholic acid (alpha-MCA) levels, which were negatively related to Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 and Bifidobacterium. Co-exposure to 5MP and TBT also decreased TG and induced bile acids accumulation in the liver due to inhibited BSEP, which might be attributed to the co-regulation of decreased T-alpha-MCA and Harryflintia. In conclusion, the administration of 5MP and TBT alone and in combination could cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and subsequently alter bile acids profiles, while the combined exposure of 5MP and TBT weakened the toxic effects of 5MP and TBT alone.

Given increasing reports on microplastic (MP) pollution in these environments, it has become crucial to better understand the role of MP particles as transport vectors for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed where particles of both synthetic and natural material (HDPE, tyre wear, and wood) were sequentially incubated at multiple sites along a salinity gradient from the Lower Weser estuary (Germany) to the offshore island Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). Following each incubation period, particle biofilms and water samples were assessed for ESBL-producing E. coli , first by the enrichment and detection of E. coli using Fluorocult® LMX Broth followed by cultivation on CHROMAgar™ ESBL media to select for ESBL-producers. Results showed that general E. coli populations were present on the surfaces of wood particles across all sites but none were found to produce ESBLs. Additionally, neither HDPE nor tyre wear particles were found to harbour any E. coli. Conversely, ESBL-producing E. coli were present in surrounding waters from all sites, 64% of which conferred resistances against up to 3 other antibiotic groups, additional to the beta-lactam resistances intrinsic to ESBL-producers. This study provides a first look into the potential of MP to harbour and transport multidrug-resistant E. coli across different environments and the approach serves as an important precursor to further studies on other potentially harmful MP-colonizing species. Unlabelled Image • The role of microplastics as transport vectors for ESBL-producing E. coli was assessed through an incubation experiment. • E. coli communities were found on the surfaces of wood particles at all sites but did not produce ESBLs. • ESBL-producing E. coli found in surface waters at all sites, most abundantly in Helgoland waters.",20200610,"Song, Jessica ; Jongmans-Hochschulz, Elanor ; Mauder, Norman ; Imirzalioglu, Can ; Wichels, Antje ; Gerdts, Gunnar",Article,Academic Journal,Jun2020,true,Science of the Total Environment,,JOUR,,,0048-9697,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,720,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137603,,3QW,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e0b34f49-41a5-3a8d-8a6f-0a1746acca97

GreenFILE,8gh,141196647,Exposure to polyamide 66 microplastic leads to effects performance and microbial community structure of aerobic granular sludge.,"Microplastic polyamide 66 (PA66) was used to explore its mechanism of influence on the contaminants removal from aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and the corresponding change to the microbial community. Results showed that the removal pollution efficiency of the experimental groups with PA66 were inhibited during the early treatment stage. However, as the experiment progressed, the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (92.66%, 93.10%, 93.11%, 93.79%) and ammonia nitrogen (94.25%, 94.58%, 95.61%, 94.73%) were similar in the addition 0 g/L (A), 0.1 g/L (B), 0.2 g/L (C) and 0.5 g/L (D) PA66 beakers at the last 10 days. On the first day, the intensity of fluorescence peaks representing tryptophan protein-like and aromatic protein-like substances of loosely-bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) indicated that the PA66 microplastic caused damage to the sludge structure, and the intensity of fluorescence peaks representing fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like substances were stronger than those in the control beaker (A).

GreenFILE,8gh,154695579,Meta-analysis reveals differential impacts of microplastics on soil biota.,"Contamination of microplastics (MPs) is a global environmental issue that has received much attention from the scientific and public communities due to ecological concerns in recent decades. Comparing with aquatic ecosystems, soil systems, regardless of the high importance and complexity, have been less studied under widely existing and increasing MP contamination. This review, combined with data assimilation and meta-analysis methods, has summarized current contamination conditions of soil MPs across different sites reported in earlier studies. While performing this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of MPs on soil biota including their numbers, biomass, diversity, and physiological properties. The results showed that abundance of soil MPs ranged from 0.34 to 410958.9 items kg<sup>-1</sup> and concentration ranged from 0.002 to 67500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> across sites, with agricultural soils containing significantly lower abundance and concentration of MPs than others. Presence of MPs significantly decreased the individual number of soil biota, operational taxonomic unit, diversity index (Simpson), movement index and reproduction rate, whereas the mortality rate was significantly increased by the soil MPs. Despite these significant effects, MPs did not significantly alter the biomass of soil biota, which could be due to a counteraction of their negative and positive effects on different groups of soil organisms. Moreover, we observed that soil MPs could significantly increase the Chao1 index, suggesting that MPs may act as a food resource for the soil rare biosphere. Based on the existing knowledge, we suggest that future studies should focus on research areas that include but are not limited to methodological improvements, intensive field investigations, risk assessment from the perspective of soil food web and bioaccumulation, MPs induced antibiotic resistance, and restoration strategies to reduce their concentrations in soil. [Display omitted] • Soil microplastics (MPs) abundance and concentration varied substantially among sites. • Agricultural soils contained lower MPs abundance and concentration than other ecosystems. • MPs decreased the number, diversity index, movement and reproduction rate of soil biota. • MPs significantly decreased soil faunal biomass but increased microbial biomass. • MPs may provide diverse habitats to feed more rare soil microbial species.",20220115,"Wei, Hui ; Wu, Lizhu ; Liu, Ziqiang ; Saleem, Muhammad ; Chen, Xuan ; Xie, Jiefen ; Zhang, Jiaen",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2022,true,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety,Biotic communities ; Soils ; Soil pollution ; Soil biology ; Biosphere ; Microplastics ; Soil classification,JOUR,,,0147-6513,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,230,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113150,,L0E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=42c4edb8-aea5-3ac8-97e8-2e3157e5cd60
GreenFILE,8gh,146952719,"Microplastic distributions in a domestic wastewater treatment plant: Removal efficiency, seasonal variation and influence of sampling technique.","Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as an important route of microplastics (MPs) to the environment. Therefore, more effective MPs sampling and detection methodologies, as well as a better understanding of their influence on MPs occurrence and distributions in WWTP effluents, are needed for better removal and control. In this work, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs was assessed by collecting samples from raw to tertiary effluent during a 12-month sampling campaign (season-based) using different sampling methods (containers, 24-h composite and large grab samples). MPs retrieved from different treatment units within the WWTP were identified and quantified using plastic/non-plastic staining followed by optical microscopy, SEM and μ-Raman microscopy. Overall, the mean removal efficiency of MPs in the WWTP was 97%, with most MPs removed by the secondary stage and a mean effluent concentration of 1.97 MPs L<sup>−1</sup> after sand filtration. The relative abundance of particles was lower than fibers in treated effluent compared with the raw wastewater, with MP fibers constituting 74% of the total MPs in raw wastewater and 91% in treated effluent. Taking seasonal variations into account is important as total MPs concentration in the effluent was notably higher in winter compared with the other seasons. Increasing the sampled volume using large samples or 24-h composite samples significantly reduced the variability between replicates. However, MPs concentration post the tertiary stage was significantly lower using morning sampling (9 am) by large grab sampling method (1.2 MPs L<sup>−1</sup>) compared to 24-h composite sampling (3.2 MPs L<sup>−1</sup>) possibly due to intra-daily changes. Using a finer mesh size (0.45 μm) to capture MPs beyond the size range typically studied (≥20 μm) effectively doubled the number of MPs detected in the tertiary effluent and highlights the importance of standardizing sampling procedures. Unlabelled Image • Sampling method affects the amount of identifiable microplastics in wastewater. • Microplastics concentrations were higher in winter compared with other seasons. • Large or 24 h composite samples contributed to minimize variability between samples. • Lower cut off mesh size (0.45 μm vs ≥20 μm) doubled the number of detected MPs. • Despite removal efficiency of 97%, annual microplastics emissions are considerable.",20210115,"Ben-David, Eric A. ; Habibi, Maryana ; Haddad, Elias ; Hasanin, Mahdi ; Angel, Dror L. ; Booth, Andy M. ; Sabbah, Isam",Article,Academic Journal,Jan2021,true,Science of the Total Environment,,JOUR,,,0048-9697,,,,,eng,Elsevier B.V.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,752,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141880,,3QW,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=73b50f61-6fee-34d5-9f95-8b3a87c1ec30

GreenFILE,8gh,148450529,Effect of microplastics and arsenic on nutrients and microorganisms in rice rhizosphere soil.,"The presence of microplastics and arsenic in soil can endanger crop growth; therefore, their effects on the properties of rhizosphere soil should be evaluated. Large (10–100 µm) and small (0.1–1 µm) polystyrene (PSMP) and polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) particles were added to soil with different arsenic concentrations (1.4, 24.7, and 86.3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) to investigate the combined effect of microplastics and arsenic pollution on rice rhizosphere soil. After the addition of PSMP and PTFE, pH, arsenic (V) and arsenic (III) in the soil were observed to decrease. The interaction of arsenic with PSMP and PTFE resulted in this phenomenon, leading to a decrease of arsenic bioavailability in the soil. PSMP, PTFE, and arsenic reduced the abundance of Proteobacteria , increased the abundance of Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria , and inhibited soil urease, acid phosphatase, protease, dehydrogenase, and peroxidase activity via affecting the tertiary structure of the enzyme. PSMP, PTFE, and arsenic also reduced the available nitrogen and phosphorus content in the soil. Arsenic increased the soil organic matter content, whereas PSMP and PTFE reduced the organic matter content. Furthermore, microplastics inhibited the effects of arsenic on the microbial and chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil. This study revealed the effects of microplastic and arsenic pollution on rice rhizosphere microorganisms and nutrients, and elucidated the mechanism by which these pollutants retard crop growth in the designed growth medium. • The microplastics increase the relative abundance of arsenic-resistant bacteria. • The microplastics inhibited the effects of As on the microbial in the rhizosphere soil. • The microplastic and As inhibited soil urease and acid phosphatase activity.",20210315,"Dong, Youming ; Gao, Minling ; Qiu, Weiwen ; Song, Zhengguo",Article,Academic Journal,Mar2021,true,Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety,Humus ; Arsenic ; Nitrogen in soils ; Polytef ; Rhizosphere ; Microplastics ; Acid phosphatase,JOUR,,,0147-6513,,,,,eng,Academic Press Inc.,N.PAG,N.PAG,,211,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.111899,,L0E,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=e75cc397-b69a-34c1-9d89-aca5b5e64c8a
GreenFILE,8gh,145631722,Microplastics in the environment: Interactions with microbes and chemical contaminants.,"Microplastics (MPs) are contaminants of emerging concern that have gained considerable attention during the last few decades due to their adverse impact on living organisms and the environment. Recent studies have shown their ubiquitous presence in the environment including the atmosphere, soil, and water. Though several reviews have focused on the occurrence of microplastics in different habitats, little attention has been paid to their interaction with biological and chemical pollutants in the environment. This review therefore presents the state of knowledge on the interaction of MPs with chemicals and microbes in different environments. The distribution of MPs, the association of toxic chemicals with MPs, microbial association with MPs and the microbial-induced fate of MPs in the environment are discussed. The biodegradation and bioaccumulation of MPs by and in microbes and its potential impact on the food chain are also reviewed. The mechanisms driving these interactions and how these, in turn, affect living organisms however are not yet fully understood and require further attention.
